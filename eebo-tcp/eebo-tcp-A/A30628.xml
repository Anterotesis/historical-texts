         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Excellent Lady,
THE

OF

Devon.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHat is done in the
following <hi>Letters</hi> in
Defence of <hi>Infants
Baptism,</hi> is so justly Your
<pb facs="tcp:103760:3"/>
Ladyships upon so many
<hi>Titles,</hi> that to disown it by
Dedicating of <hi>Them</hi> to any
Other, or not to own it
by not Dedicating of <hi>Them</hi>
to Your Ladyship, would
be as great Injustice, as, but
for your Interest in <hi>Them,</hi>
to do the last, a Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The First of <hi>Them</hi> is a
Second Edition of a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
sent my Adversary; in
<hi>which</hi> (as I thought the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
he gave, obliged me
to do) I made such Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
Additions, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
<pb facs="tcp:103760:3"/>
as might illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
my Principal Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
without engaging me
in Matters Forraign to it.
And to his Rejoynder un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>This</hi> as so Enlarged, the
<hi>Second</hi> is a <hi>Reply:</hi> and those
that follow, are Defences to
Both.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Argument</hi> is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on that <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi>
it pleased <hi>God</hi> to make with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and with his <hi>Seed:</hi>
In <hi>which,</hi> as he gave Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and all he hath to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and to his <hi>Seed;</hi> so
he requires (what is most
<pb facs="tcp:103760:4"/>
highly reasonable he should)
that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all he
owned, and that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Seed, and all they own,
should be His: And that
in Token of being <hi>so,</hi> both
<hi>Abraham</hi> himself shou'd <hi>keep
the Covenant,</hi> by wearing the
Initiating Sign <hi>thereof</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and putting it on all
<hi>His,</hi> (that was capable of
it) and also, that his Seed
should keep it in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Certain it is, the <hi>Seed</hi>
of <hi>Abraham</hi> is as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to keep the Covenant
as <hi>Abraham</hi> himself; <hi>[Thou
<pb facs="tcp:103760:4"/>
shalt keep my Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Thou and thy Seed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thee in their Generations.]</hi>
And I have proved the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Gentiles</hi> to be <hi>That
Seed;</hi> so that, though the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> must believe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi>
yet, on becoming his Seed,
they come also under the
Obligation to observe the
Covenant, as much as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
himself.</p>
            <p>I have also proved, That
the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
is the first Solemn Formal
Covenant of Grace, for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb facs="tcp:103760:5"/>
Life and Salvation,
through our Lord <hi>Christ,</hi>
that, in Account and Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
of the Scriptures, it
pleased <hi>God</hi> to make with
Man; and consequently,
that the First Separate
and Instituted Church, was
then appointed in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of <hi>Abraham:</hi> So that,
from the very <hi>Beginning</hi>
that it pleased <hi>God</hi> to Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
and Ratifie his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
and to Constitute and
Frame a <hi>Church,</hi> as did Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>n
the Signing of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>;
so he did the Singing
<pb facs="tcp:103760:5"/>
of <hi>Infants: Therein</hi> laying
the Foundations of the
Common-wealth of <hi>Israel</hi>
in the Membership of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as well as in that of
the Parents. <hi>God</hi> never
Constituted any <hi>Formal</hi>
Church, until he had made
a <hi>Formal</hi> Covenant; and
the Sign of the Covenant,
is the Rite of Initiation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Church:</hi> None comes
into the Latter, but by the
Former; and <hi>Baptism</hi> is such
a Sign.</p>
            <p>I do not say, That <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>
is come in the Place of
<pb facs="tcp:103760:6"/>
Circumcision; I know too
well the use is made of that
Expression, though in it
self, and as meant, it be most
Innocent and Inoffensive:
But I say, It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
that as Circumcision
was the Initiating Rite and
Sign before the Coming of
<hi>Christ;</hi> so (that) <hi>Baptism</hi> is
after it: And that, <hi>Now,</hi>
to dedicate and give a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to <hi>God</hi> visibly and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly,
is, by that Sign and
Rite to Matriculate him;
that is, to Enter and Initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
him into the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103760:6"/>And now, <hi>Madam,</hi> Is
not the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Infants,</hi>
in the Notion I have of it,
a thing of High and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Nature, and of great
Significancy? When it is
not <hi>meerly</hi> Baby-sprinkling,
and Sealing to a Blank, as
some do phrase it: But done
in token of our Dedicating
of <hi>Them</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> and in
Evidence and Token that
they are His. All Delivery
and Surrender must pass
with some Formality, some
Rite; and <hi>Baptism</hi> is that
Formality, that Rite, by
<pb facs="tcp:103760:7"/>
which we Christians do pass
over, and assign our selves,
and all our Children to
God.</p>
            <p>The fair Stating and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrating
the mentioned
Points, in which I beat a
Path but little trodden, is
mainly the Business of the
<hi>Letters,</hi> of which I make a
Humble Offering to Your
Ladyship: In writing <hi>which,</hi>
next to the Zeal and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
that I ow'd to <hi>Truth,</hi>
I propounded to my self
no greater Satisfaction, than
the Occasion they would

Ambition I have ever had

            <p>THE <hi>Concurrence</hi> of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
that, at last, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon me to engage
in the Controversie of <hi>Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
(managed on my part in the
following <hi>Letters</hi>) was so little or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary;
that, if any be enough to
make a <hi>Providence, This,</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
were it proper to acquaint thee
with it, would, I am confident, even
in thy Iudgement, be thy Perswasion
<pb facs="tcp:103760:8"/>
otherwise what it will, appear a great
<hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Letters</hi> themselves do inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
on what Occasion originally they
came to be Written, and also how to
be Published, and that too without
my Adversaries; and therefore, I
need not give my self the trouble of
Writing, or thee the trouble of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more, in reference to these Points.
Only, it may not be improper to do
my self this piece of Iustice, to add,
That though I do not Publish my
Adversaries Letters, (for that I
leave to him, as most proper): Yet
I have not been wanting in mine Own,
to Publish all his Arguments that
concern me, both in all the Strength
he gives them, and with all the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inforcement my self could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
add to them. This, a Iudicious
<pb facs="tcp:103760:9"/>
               <hi>Reader</hi> will easily perceive me to
have done; and this I did, as well
for that Respect and Care I owe to
my own Reputation, as for that I
owe and pay to Truth. I am of
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Mind; I would not
steal a Victory; and Truth need not:
It is stronger than all things. I
acknowledge, I have received a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from him, since my Last; but
that <hi>Letter</hi> (as Others) so little to
the Purpose, unless Reflections and
Extravagancies be so, that I do not
find my self obliged to any other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
than what in my <hi>Last</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and marked thus [*,] and
that's but little: And an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>Reader</hi> will plainly see,
there was not much need of that: It
is but one Paragraph, and two or
three Words, by way of Illustrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103760:9"/>Some happily may admire, that
in a Rich and Fruitful Subject, as
this is, I am so barren in Citations;
but they may please to know, that
(seeing a Doctrine is not true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a Multitude avouch it, any
more than a Custom good because a
Multitude follow it) I do not value
<hi>Authorities</hi> in the Search and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigation
of Truth, further than
as they are <hi>Evidences</hi> to Matters
of Fact. Indeed, on this Account
I might have Cited properly enough,
many hundred Authors, as Witnesses,
to confirm <hi>Baptism</hi> to have been of
old a <hi>Jewish Ceremony,</hi> used in
Initiation of Proselytes, both Male
and Female, Adult and Infant; but
that was done abundantly before, by
the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> (as
I remember) in a set Discourse of
<pb facs="tcp:103760:10"/>
               <hi>Baptism,</hi> and incidentally by Mr.
<hi>Ainsworth,</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi>
on <hi>Genesis</hi> 17th; and by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
and Repetition is a dull
thing. The <hi>Argument</hi> I go upon,
as I do manage it, is not common;
and hath little Authority to make it
good, beside that of sound <hi>Reason,</hi>
and good <hi>Sense,</hi> and that better of
the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
into <hi>which,</hi> rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
it doth already open no small
Lights, and may do more, if well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p>To the Question, <hi>How I came
to hit upon it?</hi> I say, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to see an Article of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
which <hi>Infants Baptism</hi>
by most is taken to be of, and indeed
is of, to hang on Wyres only, and
(as some phrase it) by <hi>Geometry:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103760:10"/>
It must, I thought, have sure and
solid Foundations, and such I could
not see it to be Owner of, unless
it were inlay'd (as I find it is) in
the very <hi>Constitution</hi> of an <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Church,</hi> and in the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
of <hi>Scripture.</hi> Analogy of
<hi>Scripture,</hi> is the surest <hi>Basis</hi> of
Truth, in matters of <hi>Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
as Analogy of <hi>Nature</hi> is
of Truth, in Points of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Argument</hi> I have so much
spoken to in the following <hi>Letters,</hi>
that I think there needs no more to
make it perfect, and fully convincing,
but to add these few following <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Baptism</hi> or <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
was at first a <hi>Jewish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
and <hi>that Aaron,</hi> and his
<pb facs="tcp:103760:11"/>
Sons were Baptized or Washed with
<hi>Water</hi> at the Door of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of the <hi>Congregation: That</hi>
the Baptizing of <hi>Proselytes,</hi> very
probably was done in imitation of
That, and the other Washings among
the <hi>Jews;</hi> and to signifie the Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of <hi>Them</hi> from the Defilement
of <hi>Gentilism:</hi> And <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Baptism</hi> in the <hi>Institution</hi>
of it, had Aspect to both These, is
also probable; we <hi>Gentiles</hi> being
by <hi>Baptism</hi> sanctified unto <hi>God,</hi>
and made his Priests; which seems
very clearly to be implyed by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,</hi>
when he calls <hi>Baptism,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Laver, (<hi>Washing</hi> our
Translators render) of <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in Allusion certainly to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
under the Law, which was set
between the Tent of the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103760:11"/>
and the <hi>Altar.</hi> Compare
<hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 6, 12. with <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> Let it be considered, that
as no Alteration in the least, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
was made by <hi>Moses,</hi> from
the <hi>Rule</hi> in the <hi>First Institution</hi>
under <hi>Abraham;</hi> so that under
<hi>Moses</hi> it is evident, <hi>First,</hi> That if
a <hi>Proselyte</hi> were <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi>
the giving of <hi>Himself</hi> to
<hi>God</hi> by <hi>Circumcision,</hi> would not
suffice to qualifie him for the <hi>Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi>
except he gave his <hi>Family</hi>
too, and that all his <hi>Males</hi> were
Circumcized. <hi>God</hi> look'd not on
him as a Convert, if he gave not all
<hi>His,</hi> as well as Himself, <hi>Exod.</hi>
13. 48, 49. And this is the more
remarkable, for that the <hi>Proselytes</hi>
were (as) the <hi>First-Fruits</hi> of the
<pb facs="tcp:103760:12"/>
               <hi>Gentiles. Secondly,</hi> That those
Strangers in the Family of a <hi>Jew,</hi>
who were the Masters <hi>Own,</hi> or his
Property, were on his Account ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to participate the <hi>Passover;</hi>
for he was to give them unto <hi>God,</hi>
as having Right and Dominion in
them; and therefore might dispose of
them: For This only is the Reason,
why the Servant of the <hi>Jew,</hi> who
was <hi>Bought</hi> with his Money, might
eat the Passover; and the <hi>Hired</hi>
Servant not; namely, that the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
as being bought with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
Money, was his Property, his
own; and therefore given with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to <hi>God,</hi> and so received <hi>God</hi>'s
Mark of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
became capable of the Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
But the <hi>Hired Servant</hi> being
not his Master's, but his own Man,
<pb facs="tcp:103760:12"/>
consequently could not, without his
own Consent and free Act, be given
and disposed of by his Master. But
if he would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Voluntarily</hi> be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcized,
and so become Partaker
of the Passover, nothing letted him
though he were an Hired Servant,
no more than any other Forreigner.
See for this <hi>Exod. 12. 43, 44,
45.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next main Consideration I
would wish to be reminded seriously,
is, That in the <hi>New-Testament</hi>
no <hi>New</hi> Rule is given either by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> Himself, or by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Followers, about the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
of the Sign of the <hi>Covenant;</hi>
which <hi>Sign</hi> now is <hi>Baptism:</hi> And
therefore, certainly, it leaves us to the
Grounds and Reasons of the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi>
[and to conformable
<pb facs="tcp:103760:13"/>
and constant Practice in the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Use of <hi>Baptism</hi> in the Admission of
Proselytes;] especially seeing the
Seed (which <hi>Seed</hi> Believers are in
<hi>Christ</hi>) are under the same <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Obligation</hi> to keep the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
in the Sign, and by the very
self-same <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi>
which <hi>Abraham</hi> had himself. And
then it is Rational to think, That as
<hi>Abraham</hi> was made to understand
it in <hi>Circumcision,</hi> so we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it in <hi>Baptism;</hi> namely,
to take in <hi>Infants</hi> as well as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult.</hi>
This is the more probable,
because in the <hi>Gospel-Institution</hi>
we find that <hi>Baptism</hi> went by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
and Houses, as <hi>Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
did both before the Law, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it; as also, that in Baptizing of
Proselytes, not only <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103760:13"/>
but (as I said)<hi>Adult</hi> and
<hi>Infants</hi> were admitted.</p>
            <p>In the last Place; It would be
considered, that in the first Sign of
the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which was <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
though <hi>all Infants</hi> were not
taken in <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>actually,</hi> yet
<hi>none</hi> of them were excluded from it
as <hi>Infants;</hi> but only as <hi>Females:</hi>
For the Nature of that <hi>Sign</hi> was
such, that, in the Actual Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of it, no <hi>Female</hi> was a
Competent Subject: So that, in the
first Signing by Virtue of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
as much</hi> as any Adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were taken in, <hi>so much</hi> those
that were not Adult; even <hi>Infants</hi>
were taken in also: And if <hi>then,</hi> the
<hi>Females</hi> were not Actually signed;
so neither in the Letter, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Denomination of them, were
<pb facs="tcp:103760:14"/>
they <hi>then</hi> taken into the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
For as the Sign was <hi>directly</hi> given
only to the <hi>Males,</hi> so the Promise
also, in terms, was only to the <hi>Males,
[Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac.</hi>] But then,
as the <hi>Females</hi> were <hi>included</hi> in
the <hi>Males,</hi> in the <hi>Covenant</hi> and
<hi>Promise,</hi>(which, I think, no Body
will deny;) so, by like Reason, they
were <hi>included</hi> also in the <hi>Sign.</hi> If
any ask the Reason, why the <hi>Females</hi>
are not taken notice of in the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi>
as much as the <hi>Males?</hi>
and why, at first, they were not, as it
were, by name taken into <hi>Covenant,</hi>
and so signed with the <hi>Sign</hi> of it;
but included only in <hi>Men,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
as signed in them? there may
be many Reasons; but among them,
two especially. The <hi>First</hi> is, That
<hi>God</hi> is Uniform in his Works; and
<pb facs="tcp:103760:14"/>
that as in the First Creation he made
<hi>Adam</hi> first, who was then the whole
Kind, and comprehended the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
in his Rib; and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
took the <hi>Woman</hi> out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi>
So in the <hi>Restoration,</hi> or
<hi>New Creation,</hi> he would first by
Name begin with the <hi>Man,</hi> and take
him into <hi>Covenant,</hi> and Sign him;
and take the <hi>Woman</hi> in but <hi>Inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,</hi>
as comprehended in <hi>Man,</hi>
and as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to him; which
he did in the <hi>Dispensation,</hi> under
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moses.</hi> But then,
afterwards, as he took the <hi>Woman</hi>
in the <hi>Creation</hi> out of <hi>Man;</hi> so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Christ,</hi> in the <hi>New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Dispensation,</hi>
he took the
<hi>Woman</hi> in her own Name, and put
his Sign on her too: Both <hi>Men</hi> and
<hi>Women</hi> are Baptized. A <hi>Second,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103760:15"/>
and perhaps no less effectual Reason,
is, That the <hi>Woman</hi> had been first
(as the <hi>Apostle</hi> observes) in the
Transgression; she had spoyled the
<hi>First Creation,</hi> and the <hi>Work</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> in it; [<hi>What's this that
thou hast done?</hi> saith <hi>God</hi> to the
<hi>Woman:</hi>] Therefore, as a Mark
of his Divine Displeasure, <hi>God</hi> would
not in the Institution of his Covenant
of <hi>Grace,</hi> take her in her <hi>Own
Name</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> or otherwise
than by <hi>Inclusion</hi> in the <hi>Man,</hi> into
the Participation of it; until by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth the Lord <hi>Christ,</hi> the great
Foundation of the <hi>New</hi> and Better
<hi>Creation,</hi> she had made him, as it
were, some <hi>Reparation;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Christ</hi> is emphatically said to
be <hi>Made of a Woman.</hi> Methinks
the <hi>Apostle</hi> hath an Aspect towards
<pb facs="tcp:103760:15"/>
both these Reasons, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
13, 14, 15. But howsoever that is,
sure I am, 'tis out of question, that
before <hi>Christ,</hi> there was no little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi>
in the Account of <hi>Scripture:</hi> for if
a <hi>Woman</hi> bore a <hi>Man-Child,</hi> she
was to be unclean but Seven days, and
to continue in the Blood of her Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
but Thirty-three days: But if
she brought forth a <hi>Maid-Child,</hi>
then she was to be unclean Two weeks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to continue in the Blood of her
Purifying Sixty-six days: So much
Difference, <hi>Then,</hi> there was between
<hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female;</hi> for so we read
in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 2, 4, 5, 6. But,
<hi>Now,</hi> the Case is alter'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> there is no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
no more <hi>Now</hi> between the
<hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> than between
<pb facs="tcp:103760:16"/>
the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Greek;</hi> for so the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi>
Gal. 3. 28. <hi>There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Iew <hi>nor</hi> Greek, <hi>there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bond nor Free, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Male <hi>nor</hi> Female; <hi>for You
are all one in</hi> Christ Iesus. A plain
Text; wherein the <hi>Apostle</hi> as well
implies there <hi>Was</hi> a Distinction and
Difference before, as he affirms that
there <hi>Is</hi> none now.</p>
            <p>As for mine <hi>Adversary;</hi> though
I do not take him to be the Greatest
Clark in the World, or as Learned in
the Learned Languages, and Human
Authors, as many others; and though
I take it to have been a piece of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in him, to tell me, as he doth,
[<hi>That as he remembred, one of
the School-men said,</hi> &amp;c.] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have Reason to believe, he
understands the School-men, as little
<pb facs="tcp:103760:16"/>
               <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek:</hi> Yet I do not
apprehend it any Disgrace (as some
would have it,) to have been enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with him; both for that he is a
careful, painful, and industrious sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Person, much conversant in the
present Controversie; and, I believe,
can say as much for his <hi>Perswasion,</hi>
as any other what ever: as also, for
that the Point in Controversy between
us, is not a <hi>Point</hi> of Human Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
Here (for the main) is no need
of <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties
of <hi>School-men,</hi> or of Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Criticisme: It must be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>plainly</hi> by good Sense, and by
the Harmony of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and
an <hi>English Bible</hi>(to which he doth
appeal) suffices for that.</p>
            <p>I do confess, I believe that some
of the <hi>Grounds</hi> which I have said,
<pb facs="tcp:103760:17"/>
will have no little Influence toward
an <hi>Alteration</hi> in many received
<hi>Schemes:</hi> But whether I have laid
them right or not, I am no compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Iudge. For though I am much
confirmed in the Verity of <hi>Them</hi> by
their undergoing of <hi>One</hi> kind of
<hi>Test,</hi> without any Loss; yet before
I do advance them from being Points
of meer <hi>Opinion,</hi> to be Points of
some Degree of <hi>Faith,</hi> I am willing
they should undergo all <hi>Others.</hi> And
therefore, <hi>Reader,</hi> they are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy Hands, (for I have done with
them) to weigh and iudge them.</p>

ARGUMENT
FOR
Infants Baptism, &amp;c.</head>
            <head>The First Letter.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot believe my self obliged by the
Occasional Discourse (which I held
almost a Year and three Quarters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go)
about <hi>Infants Baptism,</hi> to ingage
any further in that Controversie, much
less deliberately and solemnly; yet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received so large, and so elaborate
an <hi>Endeavour</hi> for my Satisfaction, and so
importunate and iterated Requests, to give
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103760:18"/>
you the Result of my most cool and serious
Considerations of what you have done in
<hi>It<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I may not be so much wanting in Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to your <hi>Desires,</hi> and in Obedience to
the <hi>Call</hi> I believe in them, as to decline the
Incumbence and Obligation under which
<hi>They</hi> put me to answer: And so, either to
receive my self a further Illumination in the
Point, or (which is better, and which I hope)
to give it.</p>
            <p>Only, let me have leave to tell you,
(That) I am sensible enough how difficult
a Task it is, in it self, to Eradicate an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi>
grown inveterate by length of Time,
and perhaps confirm'd by frequent Spoyls
and Trophies over weak Opposers of <hi>It;</hi>
and that 'tis more difficult for one in my
Circumstances, subject to a thousand Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and Diversions; and who, at the
Arrival of your <hi>Letter,</hi> thought of nothing
less in all the World, than of being enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in this manner against <hi>Anabaptism;</hi> and
with a Person, a great part of whose time
hath been imployed in Thoughts and Study
about it.</p>
            <p>And yet, under Disadvantages so great
against so great Advantages, believing my
self in the right; in that Confidence, I have
made a Resolution to let you know my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents;
and the rather, because I take
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103760:18"/>
you (and I wish, I may not be mistaken
in it) to be so unfeign'd a Lover of Truth,
and so Candid a one, that you will make
Allowance for any <hi>Byass</hi> in your Mind, in
favour of your Opinion, which a long <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi>
may give it; and that you will not
<hi>Refuse</hi> any <hi>Light</hi> that may be offered, if
you have no other Reasons for doing <hi>So,</hi>
than either that <hi>It</hi> is <hi>New</hi> unto you, or that
you have not struck <hi>It</hi> your self.</p>
            <p>As for my <hi>Sentiments</hi> on this Subject, that
you may conceive <hi>Them</hi> with the greater
Clearness, as also for Order sake, I will
reduce them unto <hi>Two Heads.</hi> First, I will
let you see the <hi>Mistakes</hi> under which you
are, as to your Apprehensions of the <hi>Grounds</hi>
of my <hi>Arguments for Infants Baptism,</hi> as
deduced from the Covenant of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
And <hi>Then,</hi> I will display the <hi>Argument</hi> it
self in all its Evidence and Force, as it is
bottomed on that <hi>Basis:</hi> And this, without
concerning of my self in <hi>Other</hi> Arguments
insisted on by others, and also touched and
reflected on by you.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mistakes</hi> you are under in your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of the <hi>Grounds</hi> of my <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
are <hi>Two,</hi> and very great ones: The
<hi>First,</hi> That you conceive me to raise my
Superstructure of <hi>Infants Baptism</hi> on this
Foundation, [<hi>That the believing Gentiles,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103760:19"/>
and their Posterity, are in</hi> All <hi>respects to be
blessed, as believing</hi> Abraham <hi>was;</hi>] which,
say you, is Absurd.</p>
            <p>And well you may (say so;) for indeed,
<hi>Abraham</hi> had peculiar Blessings appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Person; as to be the Father of all
the Faithful, and particularly, of believing
<hi>Gentiles,</hi>(the Father of many Nations;)
and therefore, instead of <hi>Abram,</hi> he was
called <hi>Abraham.</hi> But though <hi>All</hi> the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
believing <hi>Abraham</hi> had, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
on his Spiritual Children, or his Seed,
the believing <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet, if <hi>Any</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of believing <hi>Abraham</hi>'s did descend,
as <hi>That</hi> of the Promise did, it must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
(that) the <hi>Obligations</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi>
arising from the Nature of the Blessing,
(which did descend) or that are annexed
to it, (if there be any <hi>Such</hi>) must descend
too: And so, that the Seed, in that respect
in which it is equally blessed with belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Abraham,</hi> must be equally obliged
with him, to all the Duties and Incumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
that are the Consequents and Results
of that Blessing.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Second Mistake</hi> is, That you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
me to conceive, [<q>That every Child
of a believing Parent, by vertue of his
Birth, Priviledge, and as he is a Natural
Descendant of such a Father or Mother,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103760:19"/>
is a true Child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
(for that I mean) or, in your own
words, <hi>That the Natural Posterity of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Gentiles,</hi> barely as such, <hi>are all
of them the</hi> Spiritual Seed <hi>of</hi> Abraham,
(or Believers)<hi>and consequently such as
are entitled</hi>(on the Account of being his
Spiritual Seed, or Believers)<hi>unto</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<hi>'s
Covenant and Blessing.</hi>
               </q>] And in
Opposition unto <hi>This,</hi> you much enlarge;
shewing the many great Absurdities, and
ill Consequences of it, even to <hi>Fifteen:</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which truly as to any other who
hath Sense I think, and I am sure as to my
self, are all needless, and might all have been
spared.</p>
            <p>Certainly, I demand not half so much to
enforce the Argument I used; I think not
every <hi>Child</hi> of a Believer to be a <hi>Believer</hi>
himself in any Sense; much less, that Saving
Grace is as <hi>Original</hi> as Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that it comes
by Traduction. All I postulate to build
my Argument, is, That the (true) believing
<hi>Gentile</hi> doth not forfeit, by believing, his
natural Right to his Child; but that the
Children of True Believers now, under the
Gospel, are as much theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the same
Right, as the Natural Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>
were his. This is all the Question that I
beg, and this sure you will not deny me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:103760:20"/>Only, by the way, I pray you to make
no more of my <hi>Concession,</hi> than I intend it
for; for when some Pious and very <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men</hi> have argued for <hi>Infants Baptism,
from the Children of Believers their being</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's
<hi>Spiritual Seed,</hi> they mean not, I
suppose, by calling them <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Seed, as I do, and as you do; that they
are <hi>Actual Believers,</hi> and consequently Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Faith of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but only,
that they are Persons of a <hi>Religious Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and (in some sense)<hi>Holy,</hi> and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>God.</hi> And meaning but <hi>So;</hi> though
I acknowledge Children not to be <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Seed in the <hi>Sense</hi> I mentioned, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s
Seed is taken for Actual Believers,
and you have proved by Fifteen Arguments
that they are not, nor can be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Seed in this <hi>Sense;</hi> my Concession gives
you no advantage, nor do your Arguments
signifie any thing against <hi>Them;</hi> who, using
the Expression in <hi>Another</hi> Sense, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerned; for if <hi>They</hi> take Spiritual
Seed in <hi>One Sense,</hi> and <hi>You</hi> in your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
take it in <hi>Another,</hi> you do not really
oppose them, though you may think you
do; nor are your Arguments pertinent; and
the Dispute between you, as to that, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
but Strife about Words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:103760:20"/>Thus I have, with all the Clearness and
Fairness imaginable, let you see your <hi>Two
Mistakes</hi> about the Argument I urged; and
therefore, seeing you do not apprehend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
the Grounds on which I go (in it,)
I am only obliged to you for your chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<hi>Endeavours</hi> towards my Satisfaction;
but not (in the least) for any <hi>Effect</hi> of those
Endeavours.</p>
            <p>It now remaineth, that I perform what
I promised in the Second Place; which is,
To lay out the <hi>Argument</hi> for <hi>Pedobaptism,</hi>
as it is founded on the <hi>Covenant,</hi> or Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in all its Force and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
which, to do to some purpose, I
will demonstrate.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That</hi> the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
which is called the Blessing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or
the Promise of the Spirit, is still in being; and
is that Covenant of Grace the true believing
Gentiles are under.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That</hi> in respect of that Covenant
of Promise, which is called the Blessing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and the Promise of the Spirit, or
the Spiritual Promise, all the Seed that hath
the Benefit of it, are under equal Obligations
to the Duty and Incumbence arising from it,
with <hi>Abraham</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>I will shew,</hi> That the Duty and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103760:21"/>
Incumbence to which <hi>Abraham</hi> was obliged,
arising from the Covenant, or Blessing given
to him, was, by way of Restipulation, to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and give himself, and all his to <hi>God;</hi>
and, in token of that Dedication of himself,
and of all that was his, to wear himself the
Signe of the Covenant, and put it as a Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance,
and Badge, and Mark of <hi>God</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all his that was capable of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>I will also shew,</hi> That from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s
Dedication of himself, and of all
his to <hi>God,</hi> there arises a Distinction of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
into Internal and External, Absolute
and Relative; and that this Distinction (of
Holiness) is Evangelical.</p>
            <p>And having evidenced these Four things,
I will then proceed, in short, to form my
Argument.</p>
            <p>In order to the evidencing of the First
Particular, which is, <hi>That the Covenant of
Promise made to</hi> Abraham, <hi>which is called
the Blessing of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the Promise
of the Spirit, or the Spiritual and Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Promise,</hi> (that this) <hi>is still in being, and
is the Covenant of Grace,</hi> into a Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which, the (true) believing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
are taken: I only <hi>Premise,</hi> That <hi>That</hi>
is the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> the believing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
are under, <hi>Which</hi> is the true Ground
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103760:21"/>
and Foundation of all their Hopes, and of
all their Comforts; and <hi>Which,</hi> by having
a Title to it, and Interest in it, doth give
them a Title to, and Interest in the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Inheritance, the Heavenly Country, the
Everlasting Mansions in the Father's House;
and, in a word, to Salvation. And <hi>This</hi>
the mentioned <hi>Covenant,</hi> the Blessing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and the Promise of the Spirit is,
and doth: <hi>This</hi> is the true Ground and
Foundation of all the Hopes of <hi>Gentile</hi>-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and of all their Comforts; and a
Title in <hi>This,</hi> is the only Title they have
to the Heavenly Blessedness and Salvation,
or (as the Apostle is pleased to stile it) ot
the Inheritance. For thus in the <hi>Third</hi> of
<hi>Gallatians,</hi> the Apostle carries it; when
<hi>Verse</hi> the <hi>16th,</hi> he affirms, <hi>That to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<hi>and to his Seed, were the Promises
made,</hi> and <hi>Verse</hi> the <hi>18th</hi> adds, That if
<hi>the Inheritance be of the</hi> Law, <hi>it is no more
of the</hi> Promise; <hi>but</hi> God <hi>gave it</hi> (namely
the Inheritance) <hi>to</hi> Abraham <hi>by</hi> Promise:
And by <hi>What</hi> Promise, but that ratified
Covenant of Promise, <hi>I will be a</hi> God <hi>to
thee, and to thy Seed?</hi> As appears by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with <hi>Verse</hi> the <hi>16th.</hi> But he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth
<hi>This</hi> more clearly afterwards, in
<hi>Verse</hi> the <hi>20th;</hi> where he sheweth, both
that the only <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Inheritance</hi> is <hi>Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:103760:22"/>
according to the Promise; and that
the only way of <hi>Becoming Heirs</hi> according
to the Promise, and so of being interested
in it, and entitled to it, is by becoming <hi>the
Seed of Abraham</hi> to become the <hi>Children
of God;</hi> and the only way of <hi>Becoming the
Seed of Abraham</hi> (for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>) is by
<hi>Putting on of Christ</hi> through believing:
<hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>if you be Christ's,</hi> or the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of <hi>Christ;</hi> what then? <hi>Then you are
Abraham's Seed;</hi> and what if <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Seed? what then? <hi>Then you are Heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Promise.</hi> In short, this is the
<hi>Clymax;</hi> if Believers, then <hi>Christ</hi>'s; if
<hi>Christ</hi>'s, then <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; if <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Seed, than Heirs according to the
Promise: for the Promise is, <hi>I will be a</hi> God
<hi>to Thee, and thy Seed, and I will give to Thee,
and thy Seed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nor doth it make any Alteration in the
Case, that <hi>Faith</hi> is now the requisite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Salvation, or that we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be saved: <hi>This</hi> but evidences the
more clearly, that the <hi>Gospel</hi> is but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
of the Covenant of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for
<hi>as</hi> it <hi>is</hi> through Faith, that we <hi>Gentiles</hi> do
become <hi>Christ's,</hi> and by being <hi>Christ's,</hi>
that we become the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
consequently Heirs of Salvation according
to the Promise; <hi>So</hi> it <hi>was</hi> through Faith,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103760:22"/>
the Righteousness of Faith, that <hi>Abraham</hi>
(the Father of the Faithful) had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
himself: For so the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 4.
13.</hi> for <hi>the Promise, That he should be the
Heir of the World, was not to</hi> Abraham, <hi>or
to his Seed through the Law, but through the
Righteousness of</hi> Faith. <hi>Abraham</hi> believed
<hi>God,</hi> and We <hi>Christ;</hi> it was through Faith,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> had the Promise; and
through Faith also, that we the believing
<hi>Gentiles</hi> have it; as being Children not of
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Body, but of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 12, 13, 16.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Promise</hi> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> be
the <hi>Ground</hi> and Foundation of all our Hopes,
and all our Expectations, as we are <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
and it be the <hi>True Covenant</hi> of Grace;
to be sure, it is still <hi>in being,</hi> or we do
but beat the Air, and are at a loss; our
Hope is in vain, and our Rejoycing in vain;
which <hi>God</hi> forbid: And in being it is; for
the Law that came four hundred and thirty
Years after, did not, could not <hi>Disanul</hi>
the Promise that went before; and if the
Law did not, if the Law could not, nothing
else did, nothing else can disanul it: This
the Apostle evidences, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16,
17, 18. And surely, the Promise to <hi>Abraham,
I will be a</hi> God <hi>to thee, and to thy Seed</hi> &amp;c. is
a Covenant, a ratified Covenant, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103760:23"/>
by two immutable things, by Word and
Oath, <hi>In which it is impossible for</hi> God <hi>to
Lie;</hi> and therefore, cannot be disanulled;
and if it be not disanulled, it is still in being.</p>
            <p>Here I thought to have dismissed the
First Particular, and so (to) proceed to the
Second: But it strikes into my Mind, that
you may think I have not clearly enough
expressed what I mean by the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the
Blessing and the Promise of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
which did descend on the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> which
if so, would be Matter of a fresh Dispute:
And therefore, though I think the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
I have insisted on already, do suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
instruct us in what the Promise is;
yet, to leave no room for any further Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
I shall be more express in it.</p>
            <p>By the Promise, the Blessing, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (for under all these three
Terms it is represented by the Apostle) I
mean that Covenant of Promise made to
<hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. consisting of <hi>Two</hi>
Parts; a more <hi>Spiritual</hi> Part, in the <hi>7th, I
will be a</hi> God <hi>to thee, and thy Seed;</hi> and a
more <hi>Temporal</hi> one in the <hi>8th, And I will
give,</hi> &amp;c. And I take in <hi>Both,</hi> because I
find the Apostle saying, <hi>That to</hi> Abraham,
<hi>and to his Seed, were the Promises made:</hi> the
Promises; not a Promise, (which had left
it doubtful;) but the Promises, as speaking
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103760:23"/>
not of the <hi>One</hi> only, <hi>I will be a</hi> God <hi>to thee,
and thy Seed,</hi> which is the Spiritual Part;
but of the <hi>Other</hi> also, which is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
<hi>I will give to thee, and thy Seed,</hi> &amp;c.
Thus the Covenant of Promise involveth
and includeth in it <hi>Two</hi> Promises; the One
of which indeed is <hi>Principal,</hi> the Other but
<hi>Additional;</hi> but <hi>Both</hi> are in the Covenant,
in the Blessing, and consequently <hi>Both</hi> are
ratified and established: The <hi>Promises</hi> were
made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed; the
<hi>Covenant</hi> in both respects descends.</p>
            <p>I know you take it for a very strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
That the Covanant of <hi>Abraham,
Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. cannot be the Evangelical
and Gospel-Covenant; because it is a <hi>Mixt</hi>
one, and composed of a <hi>Temporal</hi> (as well
as of an <hi>Eternal</hi>) Bequest: But for that
Reason, I the <hi>Rather</hi> take it to be Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical;
For this is Gospel, that <hi>Godliness is
profitable unto all things;</hi> that is, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
in respect of this World, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Other: And why so? Why,
it hath the Promise; <hi>Having (the) Promise
of the Life that now is,</hi> as well as of that
to come: And what is this but a <hi>Finger,</hi>
to point you to the Covenant of Promise;
as the Evangelical Covenant, the Promise,
the Blessing that did descend on the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles?
1 Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:103760:24"/>And indeed, the <hi>Inheritance</hi> promised to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and which in, by, and under
him, is descended on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is not
only a Coelestial, but a Terrestrial one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:
For by that Promise, <hi>Abraham</hi> was
not only the <hi>Heir</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> but also Heir
of the <hi>World;</hi> and so the Apostle stiles him:
And the same Apostle tells <hi>Vs, All is Ours;</hi>
and <hi>Abraham</hi> being constituted by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>Heir</hi> of the World, He and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants,
according to the Flesh, were to
take Possession of it, and to have <hi>Livery</hi>
of <hi>Seisin</hi> given in <hi>Canaan;</hi> a Livery of Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin,
which was given indeed, and taken but
in <hi>Part</hi> of the World, (as Livery of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
usually is) but in the <hi>Name</hi> of the
<hi>Whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, <hi>Canaan</hi> only was promised in
the Letter, and was Inherited only by the
Carnal Seed and Descendants of <hi>Abraham:</hi>
But then it must be considered, that in the
Covenant there is more implyed, than is
expressed in the Letter; and that as in the
<hi>Letter</hi> it speaketh of the Seed which is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
namely <hi>Isaac;</hi> yet, in the <hi>Mystery,</hi>
it meaneth <hi>Christ,</hi> and that Principally: So,
though in the <hi>Letter</hi> it speaketh but of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
as given for a Possession, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so by the Carnal Seed; yet in the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi>
it means the whole World, of which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103760:24"/>
               <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Part: in which indeed he
took Possession, or had Livery and Seisin
given him; but, as I said, in the Name
of the Whole. <hi>Abraham</hi> was Heir of the
World; and so are all Believers, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Seed; for <hi>All</hi> is <hi>Ours:</hi> But how?
For We are <hi>Christ</hi>'s, and <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God's:</hi>
And it is, <hi>I will be a</hi> God <hi>to Thee, and
thy Seed;</hi> which Seed is <hi>Christ.</hi> This is
the Believer's Title, and this his Deed; his
<hi>Charter,</hi> by which he holds All.</p>
            <p>And having evidenc'd the <hi>First</hi> Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
That the Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
or the Blessing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the Spirit is still in force, and is
that Covenant of Grace by which belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> the true Seed, now both have
and hold their Title to Heaven, and to
Earth too. It will not, I suppose, require
either much Time, or much Argument, to
secure the <hi>Second;</hi> which is, <hi>That the true
Spiritual Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the believing
Gentiles, who have the Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of that Spiritual Promise and: Blesing,
and to whom it is made as well as to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<hi>are under equal Obligation to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Incombence arising from it, or annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it, with</hi> Abraham <hi>himself.</hi> For it is
a common Notion, a Sentiment approved
by the Light of Nature, That he that reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103760:25"/>
any Profit and Advantage by a <hi>Grant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
ought to bear the Burthen, and answer the
Duty and Incumbence that accompanies <hi>It.</hi>
And indeed, to hope for <hi>Salvation,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Benefits convey'd in the Covenant and
Charter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> without submitting
to the Duties and Obligations that do arise
there-from, or are annexed thereto; were
for a Person to claim an <hi>Inheritance</hi> by a
<hi>Deed</hi> of Conveyance, without holding
himself obliged to the Covenants and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
with which <hi>It</hi> is granted <hi>Therein.</hi>
Certain it is, as I have shewn already, that
the believing <hi>Gentile</hi> claimeth, hath, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nothing, but in, by, and under <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi>
He is <hi>Christ's,</hi> and so <hi>Abraham's</hi>
Seed; and so Heir according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
And he that claimeth, hath, holdeth
nothing but in, by, and under <hi>Abraham,</hi>
must claim, have, hold, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did,
according to the Tenor and Obligation of
the Deed of Gift, the Charter, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Promise, which it pleased <hi>God</hi> to
convey it by, and with the same Incumbence
and Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this remindeth me of the</hi> Third <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
which I promised to demonstrate;
namely,</hi> That the Duty and Incumbence to
which <hi>Abraham</hi> was obliged, arising from
the Covenant or Blessing given to him, was,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103760:25"/>
in way of Restipulation, to dedicate and give
himself, and all his, to <hi>God;</hi> and in token
of that Dedication of himself, and all his,
to put the Sign of the Covenant, as the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance,
and Mark, and Badge of <hi>God</hi> on
all his that was capable of it, as well as to
wear it himself.</p>
            <p>I know it cannot be difficult to You, (if
it can to any Other) to conceive that in
<hi>Restipulation</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> who had made over
unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> not <hi>Himself</hi> only, but <hi>All
he has,</hi> (that) <hi>Abraham Correspondently</hi>
should give <hi>Himself,</hi> and <hi>All he had</hi> to <hi>God:</hi>
And indeed, this <hi>Mutual Stipulation</hi> between
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> [That <hi>God</hi> and all His
should be <hi>Abraham's,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> and
all his should be <hi>God's</hi>] is the very <hi>Essence</hi>
and <hi>Substance</hi> of the Covenant: <hi>I</hi> will be
<hi>Theirs,</hi> and <hi>They</hi> shall be <hi>Mine; I will be
a God to Thee and thy Seed, and Thou and
thy Seed stall keep my Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, the Covenant doth run in <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi>
and Promissory Terms, and therefore
is called the <hi>Covenant of Promise;</hi> but yet
<hi>to be</hi> a Covenant, as there must be <hi>Parties,</hi>
so there must be a <hi>Mutual</hi> Stipulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them: And here, the <hi>Stipulation</hi> on
the Part of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though it be not so
express and literal, is plainly implied in
the Duty and Incumbence <hi>God</hi> imposes on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103760:26"/>
him, in relation to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
and Consequence arising from the
Nature and Merits of <hi>It:</hi> Which Duty
and Incumbence, and the Consequentialness
of it from the Covenant, is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. Ver.
9. <hi>Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore,
thou and thy Seed after thee in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Or, more consonantly to the Letter
of the Original, but to the same Sense, (and
in Covenant-form,) <hi>I will be a God to thee
and thy Seed, and I will give to thee and
thy Seed,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>Thou and thy Seed shall
keep my Covenant.</hi> In the <hi>Former,</hi> is the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
or Promise <hi>God</hi> is pleased to make
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed: And, in the
<hi>Latter,</hi> the Obligation and Consequence it
lies upon them; and which, therefore, <hi>God</hi>
expects too, as importing <hi>Their Stipulation,</hi>
and that Acknowledgment they owe for
<hi>His. Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore:</hi>
Therefore, wherefore? Therefore, because
I have Established my Covenant, to give
my Self and all I have to thee; to give my
Self, and give <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in <hi>Canaan</hi> the
World: <hi>Therefore,</hi> thou shalt give thy
self, and all thine to Me: And in token of
it, (that thy self and all thine is Mine) thou
shalt observe my Covenant in the sign of it;
and that so, both as to wear the sign thy
self, and to put it upon all thine that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103760:26"/>
of it. This is evident, <hi>Gen. 17. 9,
10, 11, 12, 13. Thou shalt keep my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
therefore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is my Covenant,</hi>
namely, the sign Circumcision, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may here, perhaps, not a little won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that I use so <hi>General</hi> and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Terms; and that I say, the Obligation
which lay on <hi>Abraham</hi> from the Covenant,
was to dedicate and give <hi>Himself,</hi> and <hi>All
His,</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> and in token of it, not only
himself to wear the Sign and Token of the
Covenant, which then was Circumcision;
but to put it on <hi>all His</hi> that were capable
of it: I say, Happily you may not a little
wonder, why I said not all his <hi>Seed;</hi> but
all <hi>His:</hi> Which, if you do, you will no
longer have no cause to continue it, than
till I tell you, It is to signifie, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
on <hi>Abraham</hi> arising from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
was <hi>Solemnly</hi> to dedic<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te and give
to <hi>God,</hi> together with himself, <hi>All</hi> that he
had Property in, and Title to, and was
Owner of; not his Natural Seed only, the
Off-spring of his own Body, but even his
Servants or Slaves.</p>
            <p>And here observe; if <hi>Abraham</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Incumbence and Obligation
which the Covenant of Promise did lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, <hi>[Thou shalt keep my Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore]</hi>
was <hi>Not only</hi> to circumcize his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103760:27"/>
Off-spring, <hi>But his</hi> Slaves and Servants,
(as he was, <hi>Gen. 17. 10, 12.) It must needs
follow,</hi> that the putting of the Sign and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Covenant upon <hi>Children</hi> (even
then) arose <hi>Not</hi> from their being compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the <hi>Seed,</hi> and as <hi>God</hi> was a <hi>God</hi> to
<hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed, and from <hi>God's</hi> requiring
the <hi>Seed</hi> to keep the Covenant: For <hi>His</hi>
Infant Slaves and Servants, whom <hi>Yet</hi> he
was obliged by the Covenant to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize,
were <hi>Not</hi> of his Off-spring and <hi>Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>How,</hi> then, did the Obligation to
Circumcize his Infant <hi>Servants</hi> and Slaves,
arise from the Covenant; in which no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the least, of Slaves and Servants;
but only of <hi>Seed?</hi> Certainly, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than in the <hi>Way</hi> I have mentioned,
(and this Consideration makes it clear)
namely, that <hi>Abraham</hi> in Restipulation and
Answer unto <hi>God,</hi> was obliged to dedicate
and give himself, and <hi>All</hi> he had to him, as
<hi>God</hi> did give, and convey, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and all he hath to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
in Sign and Token of this, [That
as <hi>God</hi> hath given and made Himself, and
all He hath to <hi>Abraham;</hi> so that <hi>Abraham</hi>
must not only dedicate and give himself,
but, which is the Consequence of it, all is
his to <hi>God,</hi>] the Sign and Token of the
Covenant between them, called <hi>God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:103760:27"/>
and consequently <hi>God's</hi> Sign and
Mark, must be both on <hi>Abraham</hi> himself,
and <hi>On all that is his:</hi> That is, It is not
only to be worn by <hi>Abraham,</hi> to shew that
he himself is <hi>God's,</hi> and that he hath given
himself; or by his <hi>Children,</hi> to shew that
they are <hi>God's,</hi> and that he hath given
them: but even by his <hi>Servants</hi> and Slaves,
to shew that he hath given <hi>Them</hi> too, and
consequently <hi>All</hi> that he hath. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
he that gives himself, gives <hi>All</hi> that
he hath, with himself: He owns nothing,
that is not <hi>His own.</hi> 'Tis as they were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's</hi>
Property, that his Infant Servants
and Slaves were Circumcized; and, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
<hi>All</hi> that was <hi>Abraham's,</hi> capable of
Circumcision, had it on the same Account
that <hi>Any</hi> had: And therefore, as the <hi>Infant
Slaves</hi> were Circumcized <hi>as His</hi> Property,
and by vertue of what is said to <hi>Abraham,
Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore;</hi> so
were <hi>His Children</hi> also: And <hi>Consider</hi> it,
[All Infants were Circumcized by vertue of
the <hi>Same</hi> Incumbence.]</p>
            <p>As to your Wonder, why I do express
the Obligation and Incumbence arising up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Abraham</hi> from the Covenant, in these
terms, that <hi>He was to dedicate and assign
himself,</hi> and all his; <hi>and,</hi> in token of it,
<hi>to put the Covenant</hi> in the Sign of it, <hi>as the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103760:28"/>
Mark and Cognizance of</hi> God <hi>upon himself,
and on all his that was capable of it.</hi> You
admire how <hi>Capable</hi> comes in; but you
might with more Justice have admired, if
it had been left out: For <hi>Implied</hi> it must
be; It could not be his Duty to put the
Sign upon <hi>Vncapable</hi> Persons. But your
<hi>Admiration</hi> is <hi>More</hi> the Object of <hi>Mine,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you have <hi>Granted,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Abraham, (Thou shalt keep my Covenant
therefore, thou and thy Seed)</hi> in <hi>General</hi>
terms; wherein, you say, both Sexes may
seem to be comprehended, (and indeed say
I, are so) for if he did command in <hi>General
Terms,</hi> that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all <hi>His</hi> (Seed
you say) should keep the Covenant in the
Sign and Token of it; and yet afterward
did Institute <hi>Circumcision</hi> to be that Sign and
Token, which was not competent to all:
How can the <hi>Generality</hi> of the Precept,
(Thou shalt put the Sign on all thine; when
Circumcision, that is <hi>Not competible to all,</hi>
is that Sign) be understood <hi>Accommodously</hi>
and Conveniently, as it must be, but <hi>Thus;</hi>
Thou shalt put the Sign on <hi>All thine that
are capable of it;</hi> and the wearing of it
by <hi>These,</hi> shall be <hi>Interpreted</hi> the putting of
it on <hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time, I believe, you will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
enough to grant, that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103760:28"/>
sufficiently, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was obliged
as to dedicate and give <hi>Himself,</hi> so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
and give <hi>All his,</hi> his Children, and
his Servants to <hi>God,</hi> Possessor of Heaven
and Earth; and, in <hi>Token</hi> of it, to put the
Covenant upon <hi>Them</hi> (as far as they were
capable thereof,) in the Sign of it, namely,
Circumcision. But you will say; <q>It <hi>Seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
not to be, (but give me that Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
again, for <hi>You</hi> will be more <hi>Positive</hi>)
it <hi>Was</hi> not done (you will say) with any
Relation unto us believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who
are not Circumcized: And that seeing
there is a Change and Alteration made
in the Sign, the former Obligation cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
for if Circumcision it self is past,
and done away, no Duty and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that but commenced with it, can now
abide and remain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But I pray consider, that not only <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was under Obligation to keep the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in the Sign of it, but the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
also; that is, <hi>All those</hi> to whom
the Covenant is made, are equally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to the Observation thereof, in the Sign
of it: (And therefore) not only <hi>Abraham</hi>
was obliged, but his <hi>Seed</hi> too. For, as
<hi>God is</hi> pleased to say, <hi>I will be a God to
thee, and to thy Seed; and I will give to
thee, and to thy Seed: So,</hi> he says, <hi>Thou
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103760:29"/>
and thy Seed shall keep my Covenant. Thou
shalt keep my Covenant therefore,</hi> (and not
only Thou, but) <hi>Thou, and thy Seed after
thee, in their Generations:</hi> Thou; thou and
thy Seed.</p>
            <p>So that, if the <hi>Believing Gentiles</hi> be (as
indeed they be) the <hi>True Seed,</hi> and <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally</hi>
intended in the Promise; for it is <hi>Seed,</hi>
not <hi>Seeds:</hi> Seed; speaking but of one, and
that One is <hi>Christ;</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> not Personal
only, but <hi>Mystical,</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> with his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
for it is of Many in One: For the
Seed, which is to keep the Covenant, is to
do it <hi>in their Generations;</hi> not in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
but in their Generations, and that
is Plural. I say, if the <hi>Believing Gentiles</hi>
do become the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (as they
do) they come also under <hi>Equal Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to observe the Covenant, with <hi>Abraham</hi>
himself: For it is, <hi>Thou shalt keep the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
therefore, thou and thy Seed.</hi> And
to keep the Covenant, (as I have evinc'd
already) is for him that is in it, in token
of his Dedication and Assignment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and of all his to <hi>God,</hi> not only to wear
the sign of the Covenant himself in his own
Person, but to put it upon all his that is
capable of it; so to manifest, that he owns
not any Interest or Property at all in any
thing, or Title to any, but what he returns
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103760:29"/>
to <hi>God;</hi> and that both himself, and all his,
are the <hi>Lord</hi>'s. And think, Are not the
believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> as much obliged to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and dedicate, and give all, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham?</hi>
Yes, doubtless, and are as much
bound to <hi>Shew,</hi> and Own, and Declare they
do so, as He.</p>
            <p>But whereas it may be objected, <q>That
Circumcision was the Sign and Token
of the Covenant then, [<hi>This is my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which you shall keep between Me and
You, and thy Seed after thee; Every Man-Child
among you shall be Circumcized:</hi>]
And that <hi>Circumcision,</hi> as being a Legal
and Carnal Ceremony, is abolished un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel; and therefore, as all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
and Obligation unto <hi>That,</hi> so
all Ingagement and Obligation unto any
Sign and Token by vertue of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>That,</hi> is ceased.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, Though Circumcision, that at
<hi>First</hi> was the Sign and Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
be taken away; yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the Obligation to observe and
keep the Covenant in any <hi>Other</hi> Sign or
Token, doth cease with it. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
this; it must be minded, that <hi>as</hi>
the <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of the Command
doth hold in <hi>Baptism,</hi> as well as in <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision;</hi>
and for any other Sign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Token
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103760:30"/>
as well as for <hi>This;</hi> and to the Seed, as
well as to <hi>Abraham; God</hi> being as much
a <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>One,</hi> as to the <hi>Other: So</hi> also
that in the <hi>Form</hi> of the Words, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
imposed upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his
Seed, is in the <hi>First</hi> place, to keep the
Sign and Token of the Covenant, or to
keep the Covenant in the Sign of it: And
but in the <hi>Second</hi> (place,) to observe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision;
namely, but as it is that Sign.
So that a plain Distinction is mad<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> between
the <hi>Obligation</hi> to observe the <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
of the Covenant, (or to keep the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in the Sign and Token of it) and to
keep it in <hi>Circumcision,</hi> as that Sign and
Token; the <hi>Former</hi> arising from the very
Nature of the Covenant, (<hi>Thou shalt keep
my Covenant therefore</hi>) and therefore of as
perpetual Obligation and Existence, as the
Covenant it self: But the <hi>Latter</hi> is more
positive, and Secondary. Wherefore, tho'
there be an Alteration in the Second, it
will not follow that there must be one in
the First; or that the Covenant ought not
to be observed in the Sign and Token of it,
if, for certain Reasons, Circumcision be no
longer; but something else be that Sign and
Token: The taking away the <hi>Second,</hi> doth
not destroy the First; for being before it,
it may be without it. Thou shalt keep
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103760:30"/>
the Sing of the Covenant, that is First; Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
is that Sign, that is Second: And
why <hi>One</hi> in the first Place, and the <hi>Other</hi>
but in the Second, but to shew, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
must be kept in the Sign of it, even
when no longer Circumcision, but some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing is in the Counsel of <hi>God</hi> ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be that Sign? And indeed, it is much,
that the taking, and the putting of the
Sign of the Covenant, should (as it is) be
called keeping of the Covenant? Must not
we <hi>Now</hi> keep <hi>God's</hi> Covenant?</p>
            <p>And to the end you may see the <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and (with it) the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of that Illation, which I make from
the <hi>Form</hi> of the Words here; see the like
(Form of Words) in the <hi>Fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
in relation to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> bottoming
the like Illation; <hi>Remember the Sabbath-day,
to keep it holy;</hi> that is first; and, as it
is first, so it is primarily Moral, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and unchangeable: <hi>But the Seventh is
the Sabbath of the Lord;</hi> that is in the second
place, and is but secondary and positive.
What? Doth the Obligation to the <hi>First,</hi>
and that which is <hi>Primary</hi> in the Command,
cease, because there is an Alteration in the
<hi>Second;</hi> and that not the <hi>Seventh,</hi> but the
<hi>First Day</hi> of the Week is now the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
of the <hi>Lord?</hi> Who will say it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:103760:31"/>So, though Circumcision be no longer
the <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Token</hi> of the Covenant, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thing be <hi>It;</hi> 'twill not follow, the
Covenant is no longer to be observed in the
Sign and Token of it, because not Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision;
but that other Thing is now (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come)
that Sign and Token: Which you
will conceive the better, if you bethink
that Circumcision was not abolished in the
Gospel, as it was of the Fathers, but as it
was of <hi>Moses,</hi> (a Distinction <hi>Christ</hi> himself
makes;) or not as it had relation to the
Covenant of Promise, as the Sign of it, as
if in that respect it were a weak and carnal
thing; but as it was <hi>Adopted</hi> by the Legal
<hi>Mediator,</hi> and made a Sign of that Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
and Covenant, in which <hi>He</hi> had
to do; for afterwards, who so was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,
did become a Debtor to the
whole Law; and therefore, if the Law did
cease, Circumcision could not continue.</p>
            <p>But remember, it was on an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and Gracious Consideration, that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
did become the Sign of the Legal
Covenant or Administration: For why was
it? Were there not other Matters enough to
make Signs of, but that Circumcision, which
was a Sign of the Promise, must be <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated</hi>
to be the Token of the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
Covenant? Why was it then? Not truly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103760:31"/>
(as you may think) to make an Alteration
in the <hi>Promise,</hi> in respect of the Subjects,
to which the Sign <hi>Thereof</hi> was to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or of any Priviledges, or first and
immediate Duties and Obligations of <hi>It;</hi>
but to establish and confirm the Promise.
For Circumcision, the Sign and Token of
the Promise, was, in Divine Wisdom, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the <hi>Legal Covenant,</hi> (as the Sign
and Token of <hi>That,</hi>) for the same Reason
that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself, (who was the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Seed, to whom the Promise was made)
was made the Minister of the <hi>Legal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision:</hi>
(He was the Angel that spake
with <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wilderness, or that
gave the Law; and <hi>He,</hi> in the Days of his
Flesh, but preached to the <hi>Jews.</hi>) It was
for the Truth of <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Confirm</hi> the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to the Fathers; for so saith the Apostle,
<hi>Rom. 15. 8. Now I say, that Jesus Christ
was the Minister of the Circumcision, for the
Truth of God, to confirm the Promises unto
the Fathers.</hi> I say, for <hi>This</hi> Reason, as
also (which is an <hi>Amplification</hi> of it) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to shew, that there was no Salvation
and Inheritance by the Works of the Law,
Circumcision, which had been the Sign and
Token of the Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
was taken and applied to be the Sign and
Token of the Legal Covenant, which came
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103760:32"/>
by <hi>Moses;</hi> to <hi>Become which</hi> indeed by the
(capable) Ceremoniality of it in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
[not as it was a Sign of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
for there is nothing like a Ceremony
in being but that, but as it was confined to
one Sex, and (in the Execution and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it) to a certain Day] it was very
<hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Fit.</hi> The Reason, I say, it was
applied to the Legal Covenant, besides the
<hi>Fitness</hi> of it, was for the Truth of <hi>God,</hi> to
<hi>Confirm;</hi> and not either to <hi>Destroy</hi> or <hi>Alter</hi>
the Promise made unto the Fathers; <hi>God</hi>
taking the <hi>Token</hi> of the Covenant of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and putting it upon the Legal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to be a Sign of it, to shew he had
his Covenant of Promise still <hi>in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:</hi>
For <hi>Doing so,</hi> He could never look
on, or so much as think on the Law, but
He must also remember the Promise; the
Sign and Memorial of the Promise being
thus annexed, and put to the Law.</p>
            <p>[Thus Circumcision, the first Sign and
Token of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, though it
were <hi>Adopted</hi> into the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and
made a Sign and Token of that Covenant in
which he Mediated; it was <hi>So</hi> but for the
same Reason, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself was
made the Minister of it: That is, not in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation</hi>
of the <hi>Promises</hi> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and his Seed, or of any Priviledges, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103760:32"/>
Duties and Incumbencies arising from <hi>Them,</hi>
but in <hi>Confirmation</hi> (of them.) <hi>It was for
the Faith of God, to confirm the Promises to
the Fathers.</hi> And therefore, though <hi>as
Adopted</hi> into the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and made
a Part and Member thereof, it must conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
be annulled, and cease therewith;
yet, seeing that Adoption of it into the
Law was in Confirmation of the Promise,
the Abrogation and Cessation of <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
with the Law, as now become a Part
of it, cannot be understood to be in any
Diminution of the Promise; <hi>It</hi> not ceasing
as it was a Sign and Token of the Promise,
but as it was become a Member and Part of
the Law.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And so much in Demonstration of the</hi>
Third <hi>Particular,</hi> (viz.) That the Duty
and Incumbence to which <hi>Abraham (and the
same is said of his</hi> Seed) was obliged, as
being in Covenant, was, by way of Restipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to dedicate and give <hi>Himself,</hi> and all
<hi>His</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> and, in token of that Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of himself, and of all his, to put the Sign
and Token of the Covenant, as the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,
and Mark, and Badge of <hi>God</hi> upon
all his, as well as to wear it himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It now remaineth, that I manifest what
I promised to do in the</hi> Last <hi>place,</hi> (viz.)
That from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Gift and Dedication
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103760:33"/>
of Himself and His to <hi>God,</hi> there arises a
Distinction of Holiness into Internal and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal;
the Former positive and absolute, the
Latter relative: And that this Distinction
is Evangelical, and as applicable unto our
Times since the Law, as to the Times before
it, and under it.</p>
            <p>That from the <hi>Double Dedication</hi> the
Covenant of Promise obliges to, and which
<hi>Abraham</hi> practised, there arises such a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi>
of Holiness, is evident; for to be
<hi>Holy,</hi> being to be <hi>Separated or Dedicated
to God,</hi> as He is a <hi>God</hi> in Covenant: [For
whether it be a Person, or it be a People,
that is Holy, still to be Holy is to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,
to be Separated, it is to <hi>Be</hi> to the
<hi>Lord</hi> their <hi>God; Deut. 14. 21. Thou art
an Holy People unto the Lord thy God:</hi>
For a People to be <hi>Vnto the Lord their God,</hi>
is to be Holy; for as to be Blessed or Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
the <hi>Lord</hi> must be a People's; so to be
Holy, they must be the <hi>Lord</hi>'s.] And <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
also, that a Person may be <hi>Separated
and Dedicated</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and so become
<hi>His</hi> as He is a <hi>God</hi> in Covenant, either by
a Separation and Dedication, which is the
Persons <hi>Own Act;</hi> as when <hi>Abraham</hi> or any
other doth devote and give himself unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
and cordially to <hi>God;</hi> or else he may
be so <hi>By</hi> a Dedication and Separation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103760:33"/>
               <hi>from Another's Act,</hi> and not his
own; he being another's, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
capable of being given and devoted by
him.</p>
            <p>This being so, <hi>What</hi> can be clearer than
that there are <hi>Two Kinds</hi> of <hi>Holiness;</hi> of
which, the <hi>Former</hi> (wherein the Person
himself is Active, and doth dedicate and
give himself) is <hi>Positive:</hi> Internal, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
the <hi>Latter,</hi> (in which he is Passive,
and is but dedicated, assigned, and given
by another, whose he is) is <hi>External</hi> and
Relative; not a Holiness in the Person, but
a Holiness upon him. With the <hi>Former</hi>
kind of Holiness, <hi>Abraham</hi> himself was
Holy; but with the <hi>Latter,</hi> his <hi>Infant</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Servants: Who, to shew that
they were <hi>Gods,</hi> had the Mark of <hi>God</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; as ours, to shew that they are
<hi>So,</hi> have his Name.</p>
            <p>And that this Distinction of Holiness into
External and Internal, Positive and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
a Holiness that is saving, and a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
that is not, hath <hi>Place in Gospel-times,</hi>
is as evident as that it had <hi>One</hi> under the
<hi>Law,</hi> and before the <hi>Law:</hi> To manifest
which, I will remind you of a <hi>Text</hi> that
hath been much in discourse, and on which,
for obvious Reasons, I will a little insist: It
is 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 14. For the unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103760:34"/>
is sanctified by or in the Wife, and the
unbelieving Wife is sanctified by or in the
Husband.</hi> Where note, One Person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Sanctified,</hi> but not being <hi>Saved</hi> by the
relation which it hath to another, it can
only be <hi>So</hi> Externally: The Believer is a
<hi>Saint,</hi> and so Internally holy; but the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer
is but <hi>Sanctified</hi> or Sacred, (and
that not as a Person, a Man or a Woman,
but as a Person in such a Relation, as a
Husband or Wife) by the relation which
he hath to that: So <hi>Athanasius</hi> makes, or
rather notes the Distinction.</p>
            <p>The Design and Scope of the Apostle in
the Text, is to satisfie a <hi>Case of Conscience,</hi>
which, it seemeth, had been proposed to
him; and was, Whether the Bond of
Marriage contracted between Persons, both
at the Time of that Contraction, in a state
of Infidelity, were obliging afterward, if
one of them became a Convert? Or, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the believing Husband were not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to put away the unbelieving Wife,
and the believing Wife to leave her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
that believed not; seeing the Apostle
(for this likely was the Occasion) had <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised</hi>
them in a former Epistle, not to keep
company with Idolaters and prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
and they comprehended not how
<hi>Then</hi> a Believer, a Holy Person, could hold
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103760:34"/>
Communion in the Matrimonial State with
an Unbeliever, who is an Idolater and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>Case;</hi> and to this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
gives a plain and positive <hi>Resolution,</hi>
Vers. 12, 13. <hi>But to the rest speak I, not
the Lord; If any Brother hath a Wife that
believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with
him, let him not put her away; and the
Woman which hath an Husband that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not, if he be pleased to dwell with her,
let her not leave him.</hi> Then he seconds the
Resolution and Decision which he had
made, with a <hi>Reason</hi> that doth expresly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
the <hi>Ground</hi> and Foundation of their
Scruple, and that in the former Part of the
<hi>14th</hi> Vers. <hi>For the unbelieving Husband is
sanctified in or by the Wife, and the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Wife is sanctified in or by the Husband.</hi>
In fine, he <hi>Fortifies</hi> that Reason by a further
Consideration, taken from the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Absurdity that else would follow,
if it should not be as he affirmed; and that
in the latter Part of the <hi>14th</hi> Vers. <hi>Else
your Children are</hi> (or would be) <hi>unclean;
but now</hi> (or whereas) <hi>they are holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sense <hi>You</hi> give of the Apostles <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
(for of his <hi>Resolution</hi> and Decision I
know no Controversie) is;</p>
            <q>
               <p>That the
Bond of Matrimony still remains: Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103760:35"/>
makes no Alteration in <hi>Civil</hi> Bonds
and Contracts. The unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is as much clean or lawful, that is
<hi>(say you)</hi> sanctified to the Use of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Wife; so that she may now as
freely admit his Conversation in a Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
way, as ever before: And the like
of the unbelieving Wife to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Husband. For were it otherwise,
your Children must be <hi>Illegitimate,</hi> and
Bastards; whereas they are not so, but
<hi>Lawfully Begotten,</hi> and of clean Blood.</p>
               <p>For this Sense, you argue from divers
Considerations: <hi>One</hi> is, That the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the unbelieving Parents must be of
the <hi>same Kind</hi> with that of the Children,
and that of the Children the same with
that of the unbelieving Parents; and
therefore, can be only <hi>Civil.</hi> Another;
<hi>That</hi> the Apostle, when he saith, <hi>The
unbelieving Husband is sanctified,</hi> doth not
say by the <hi>Believing</hi> Wife, but only by
the <hi>Wife;</hi> and when the unbelieving
Wife is sanctified, he saith not by the
<hi>Believing</hi> Husband, but only by the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:</hi>
Which sheweth, that the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is only by the Conjugal <hi>Relation,</hi> as
one is a Husband, the other a Wife; not
as a believing Husband, or believing
Wife. And the <hi>Third</hi> is, That in <hi>Mal.</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:103760:35"/>
2. 15. the word <hi>Holy</hi> is taken for Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
and Lawful.</p>
            </q>
            <p>But for all this, the <hi>Sense</hi> you give of
the Apostle's Reason, can never be <hi>His,</hi>
as being altogether incongruous, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13.</p>
            <p>Again, How is the Unbeliever <hi>Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated</hi>
in or by the Believer? Both are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
in respect of Conjugal Relation; one
doth not legitimate another, but the <hi>Law</hi>
of Nature or Nations legitimates them
both to one another. But here, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, <hi>The unbelieving Husband is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife
is sanctified by the Husband;</hi> and therefore,
to be Sanctified, is not to be Legitimated.
And observe, It is the <hi>Vnbeliever</hi> is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the <hi>Believer:</hi> He saith not, The
Believer is sanctified by the Unbeliever;
whereas, if to be Sanctified be to be Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimated,
both are equally Sanctified by,
or rather to one another.</p>
            <p>But say you; <q>It is not said by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
That the unbelieving Husband is
sanctified by the <hi>Believing</hi> Wife, nor
that the unbelieving Wife is so by the
<hi>Believing</hi> Husband: He saith, barely, <hi>By
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103760:36"/>
the Wife, and by the Husband;</hi> not by
the believing Wife, and by the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Husband.</q> As <hi>if</hi> it were not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood, when he saith of a Husband
and Wife, of which it is supposed one is
a Christian, a Believer; the other not:
That <hi>the unbelieving Husband is sanctified
by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is
sanctified by the Husband.</hi> Certainly, it is
the Unbeliever is sanctified by the Believer;
especially seeing this Wife, and this Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<hi>Vers.</hi> 15. is called the one a <hi>Sister,</hi>
the other a <hi>Brother:</hi> And also, that in some
Copies, particularly that of <hi>Claremont, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi>
is added, as <hi>Beza</hi> assures; and so
<hi>Tertullian</hi> also, and <hi>Athanasius,</hi> read it.</p>
            <p>Again, in all the Scripture, the term <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified</hi>
is never put for <hi>Civilly Legitimated;</hi>
and you might as well have said, it signifieth
<hi>Nothing,</hi> as that it signifies but <hi>That:</hi> For
as for <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. the term <hi>Holy</hi> is not in
the Text; for it is not there a Holy Seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but a <hi>Seed of God,</hi> and that according to
the Usage of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who put the
Name of <hi>God</hi> to what excels; as a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>God</hi> for a High Mountain, an Army
of <hi>God</hi> for a Great Army, a Lyon of <hi>God</hi>
for a Lyon that excels in Strength or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and so a Seed of <hi>God</hi> for an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
excellent Seed; a Seed not basely, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103760:37"/>
or adulterously begotten; but
according to the Law and Institution of <hi>God,</hi>
in lawful and orderly Matrimony: And if
the Seed of <hi>God</hi> be an Honourable, Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and Legitimate Seed, will it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow, that the word <hi>Holy</hi> (a word
the Prophet uses not) doth signifie Lawful
or Legitimate?</p>
            <p>And whereas you say, [<q>The Seed of
<hi>God</hi> can be understood in no other Sense,
but that of a <hi>Lawful</hi> Seed, in opposition
to <hi>That</hi> born in <hi>Poligamy;</hi> and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
against <hi>Poligamy</hi> from that Text:)</q>
I cannot but observe, that you will take for
sufficient <hi>Evidence,</hi> in some Points, <hi>That</hi>
which is not currant even with you in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
For is not this an <hi>Old-Testament</hi>
Text, as well as <hi>Gen. 17?</hi> and yet suffices
to conclude against Poligamy, <hi>Though</hi> the
latter must not for Baptism. And <hi>tho'</hi> more
is to be said against the Illation you make
from the <hi>One,</hi> than can against <hi>That</hi> I make
from the <hi>Other.</hi> For the <hi>Seed of God,</hi> in the
Text, is not literally and directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the Issue born in <hi>Any</hi> Poligamy, but
in <hi>Adulterous</hi> Poligamy; for words must be
interpreted according to the Scope and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter:
and the Design and Scope of
the Prophet, is not to argue against Poligamy
<hi>as such,</hi> in which there may be no <hi>Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:103760:37"/>
but against Adulterous Poligamy, in
which there always <hi>Is;</hi> it being founded in
Treacherous putting away: Which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
in that the Prophet concludeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Former,</hi> but the <hi>Latter; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
take heed to your Spirit; let none deal
treacherously against the Wife of his Youth.</hi>
Deal treacherously! Wherein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In Poliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as such? No; but in the Divorce, then,
commonly in Practice; which was, to put
away one Wife to take another: or in (as
I called it) Adulterous Poligamy, Poliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
founded on unjust <hi>Divorce:</hi> For saith
he, <hi>The Lord the God of</hi> Israel, <hi>he hateth
putting away.</hi> Plainly, the Treachery lay
not barely in Poligamy, or the having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Wives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for to say it did, is great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
against the Father of the Faithful, and
against the Generation of the Just: For did
<hi>Abraham</hi> deal treacherously? or did <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob?</hi>
or did <hi>David,</hi> but in the Matter of
<hi>Vriah?</hi> &amp;c. Was the <hi>Church,</hi> the true
Off-spring of <hi>God,</hi> founded in an Ungodly
Seed? Were not the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> the Issue
of Poligamy? Or can it be imagined, that
the Father of the Faithful, the Man after
<hi>God</hi>'s own Heart, and the Father of the
Twelve <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> should live and die in
Treachery, Perjury, Adultery? And yet
they did in Poligamy: No, the Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103760:38"/>
lay not simply in Poligamy, or having
many Wives; but, as I said, in <hi>Adulterous
Poligamy,</hi> or the <hi>Divorce</hi> then in Practice,
which was, the <hi>Cruel putting away of one
Wife, to take another:</hi> For this, as <hi>Christ</hi>
explains it, is <hi>Adultery;</hi> and consequently,
Treachery against the Divorced.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Conclusion</hi> be against Divorce,
that Divorce which was in Practice in that
time, the <hi>Medium</hi> or Argument by which
he doth deduce it, must be understood <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:</hi>
And what is the <hi>Medium?
God made One,</hi> when the Remainder of the
Spirit was with Him, and He could have
made more: And why then but One, but
that He might have an Excellent Seed;
which, in direct and literal Correspondence
to the Conclusion, <hi>[Therefore deal not trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cherously,
in putting away,]</hi> must be <hi>Thus</hi>
Interpreted: He made <hi>One;</hi> but One, that
He might have an excellent Seed; not a
base, dishonourable Seed, the Issue of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
and treacherous Divorce; but an
honourable, orderly Seed, according to his
own Ordinance and Institution of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
And therefore, He made One;
but One, that there being but One (All,)
<hi>Adam</hi> might have no <hi>Choice</hi> of more, and
consequently might be uncapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Treachery against <hi>That One</hi> he had,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103760:38"/>
in putting her away to take <hi>Another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is plainly the Reasoning of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi>
But though from this <hi>Medium</hi> he but
argues, and so doth <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> too, against
<hi>Adulterous Divorce;</hi> yet seeing the same
<hi>Medium</hi> may be used to more than one
Conclusion, I do not lay any Imputation on
your Argument against Poligamy, from the
Prophet's, <hi>That God made but One;</hi> and
consequently, <hi>Adam</hi> could not have more
than One: No, though it may be said, That
the Argument would hold as well against
<hi>Successive,</hi> as <hi>Contemporal</hi> Poligamy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
there being but one Woman (all) made,
<hi>Adam</hi> could no more have one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than two at once: And though the
Holy <hi>Patriarchs</hi> understood it not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Poligamy, which they practised; but
against Adulterous Divorce, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
practised.</p>
            <p>I hope, you will not understand me here
beside my Intentions, to offer what I <hi>Have</hi>
in favour of Poligamy: I know that from
the Beginning it was not so; it could not
be so; and that the Churches of <hi>Christ</hi> have
no such Custom: I only offer it, to let you
see, how <hi>Just</hi> you are to the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and to Consequences and Deductions
in Matters in which you have no <hi>Prejudice;</hi>
and again, how <hi>Hard</hi> in things in which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103760:39"/>
you have <hi>Any:</hi> Seeing a <hi>Well-laid Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>
and Deduction, from an <hi>Old-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
Text, shall render you Impregnable
in <hi>One Case,</hi> against the Battery of many
not unworthy Considerations; <hi>But</hi> shall not
signifie a Button in <hi>Another,</hi> though the
Considerations against <hi>It</hi> are in no Degree
so numerous, or so weighty: As if <hi>For</hi> you,
any Probability and Appearance must be
Demonstration; but <hi>Against</hi> you, even
Demonstrations as good as the Nature of
the thing will bear, must not have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of being bare Probabilities. But
This by the way. To return.</p>
            <p>The Sense I have of the Apostle's <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and of the <hi>Reason</hi> with which he enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it, is, That notwithstanding the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and Unbelief of one of the Conjugal
Pair; (yet) the other might still cohabit,
and Conjugally converse with him, or with
her: For though the Person of the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
be not sanctified; yet the Relation is,
and the Matrimonial use is, and that in and
by the Faith of the Believer; who, by a
Dedication of himself, or of her self, and of
all he doth, and all he useth, in receiving
all, and doing all with giving of Thanks,
and with a <hi>Superior Reference,</hi> doth thereby
sanctify, make different and holy, (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Relatively and Externally) what with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103760:39"/>
that Dedication and Superiour Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
was in it self but <hi>Common,</hi> Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and Unclean: As 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5.
where mark the <hi>Limitation; To him that
Believeth:</hi> and also the <hi>Manner</hi> how san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;
<hi>By the Word and Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Apostle enforceth this Reason;
namely, the <hi>Sanctification of the Vnbeliever
in and by the Believer,</hi> as to Conjugal Acts
and Uses, by a further Consideration, <hi>viz.</hi>
That (there being the same Reason for the
Unbelieving Parent, as for the Children that
do not Actually believe) if it were not <hi>So,</hi>
[If the Unbelieving Husband, as a Husband,
were not sanctified by the believing Wife,
but remained <hi>Common, &amp;c.</hi>] then their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
(which they would not easily grant)
must be also common, and unclean, and as
unholy as the Children of the meer <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;</hi>
who, being Aliens to the Common-Wealth
of <hi>Israel,</hi> Strangers to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Promise, and so without <hi>God</hi> as in
Covenant, <hi>Can</hi> do no Act in reference to
him; that is, no Holy Action; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
tho' they might <hi>Lawfully</hi> (both by
the Law of Nature, and the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
beget <hi>Children,</hi> which therefore would
be Legitimate; yet they could not do it
<hi>Holily,</hi> and therefore their Children could,
not be Holy. A Heathen may do a thing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103760:40"/>
               <hi>Lawfully;</hi> but only a Christian can do a
thing <hi>Holily:</hi> That is <hi>Lawfully</hi> done, which
is done according to Law, Civil or Divine,
Natural or Positive; but that only is <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
done, which being Lawful, is done with
<hi>Reference to God</hi> in Covenant, and for his
Glory. And as Children are called <hi>Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi>
as they are lawfully begotten; so
they are called <hi>Holy,</hi> as being Holily begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
Thus it is, as if the Apostle had said,
If the Unbelieving Husband be not Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Believing Wife, and the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Wife by the Husband that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;
then are your Children still Unholy,
still Unsanctified, and but as the Children
of meer <hi>Heathens:</hi> For if your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are Holy and <hi>Sanctified,</hi> (as you do
acknowledge them) they be <hi>So</hi> but by the
Dedication of the believing Parent by Word
and Prayer, with a Relative and External
Sanctity. And <hi>Thus</hi> the unbelieving Wife
<hi>May</hi> be sanctified, and <hi>Is</hi> by the Husband
that believeth; and <hi>Thus</hi> the unbelieving
Husband is <hi>Sanctified</hi> by the believing
Wife, as well as your Children: every
Believer <hi>Sanctifying,</hi> Dedicating, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating
all he hath Concern in or with,
by Prayer applying the Word: <hi>Else were
your Children common and unclean; whereas
now they are Holy. Designati Sanctitatis,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:103760:40"/>
saith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Candidates of Holiness.
And thus the unbelieving Husband and
Wife (as Husband and Wife) are holy,
<hi>as</hi> the Children are holy, with a <hi>Relative</hi>
and External Holiness, one and the <hi>same</hi> sort
of Holiness.</p>
            <p>And whereas you think, <q>That in the
Gospel-Administration there is no such
thing as a <hi>Relative</hi> and External <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
               </q>]
I on the contrary am apt to
think, there was never <hi>More;</hi> and that the
Ceremonial Holiness under the Law, did
in a great degree but signifie the Latitude
of <hi>This</hi> in the Gospel: For what is the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of</hi> our Actions, Natural or Civil, and <hi>of</hi>
the Members of our Bodies, and <hi>That</hi> which
is <hi>on</hi> Creatures by <hi>craving</hi> a Blessing on <hi>them,
Other</hi> than a <hi>Reference</hi> (in the doing of the
Former, and in the using of the Latter) to
the Glory of <hi>God?</hi> In this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
this Reference to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in the use
of <hi>Creatures,</hi> and the use of our <hi>Members,</hi>
consists the <hi>Sanctification</hi> of <hi>Them,</hi> to <hi>Which</hi>
in all things a Believer is obliged: For
<hi>Whether we do eat, or do drink, or what-ever
we do, all must be done</hi> (with this Reference
to <hi>God,] for the Glory of</hi> God. Thus a
Christian is a Person that is <hi>Entirely</hi> to <hi>God;</hi>
that in all he <hi>Is,</hi> and <hi>Hath,</hi> and <hi>Doth,</hi> is
<hi>To,</hi> and <hi>For God:</hi> He is a <hi>Priest,</hi> and he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103760:41"/>
is an <hi>Offering,</hi> and he is a <hi>Temple</hi> too: So
that, now, Holiness is on the Bells of the
<hi>Horses,</hi> and the <hi>Pots</hi> (Vessels of common
Use) are as the <hi>Bowls</hi> before the Altar; all
Holy and Consecrated. No Action of a
Believer, much less his Marrying, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Marriage, and the consequent Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that State, must be common, but
holy; and every Action of an Unbeliever,
is common and unholy: <hi>To the Pure all
things are Pure, but to the Vnbeliever nothing
so:</hi> Even the Lawful Actions of the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
who is without <hi>God</hi> in the World,
are unholy. Holy Christian Matrimony, and
holy Christian Use of one another, differs
much from Unholy and Unchristian. Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
do <hi>Lawfully</hi> come together; but they
do not <hi>Holily:</hi> They never think on <hi>God</hi>
in Covenant in it.</p>
            <p>Now, in your second Thoughts, I pray
consider, which of the given Senses is the
most probable, either <hi>That</hi> which agreeth
not to the Text, so much as in the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar;
but is far fetcht, violent, and forced:
or <hi>That</hi> which is not only Natural and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine,
without Constraint and Violence to
the words; but also agreeth both <hi>to</hi> the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of Faith, and <hi>to</hi> the Design of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle:
As which not only resolves the Case
proposed; but, by obviating the Ground
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103760:41"/>
of the Scruple, doth fully satisfie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
A Sense not mean and low, as that
is which makes the Holiness to be but Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
(to be) a meer Lawfulness; but a High,
Lofty, Spiritual, Evangelical Sense: a Sense
truly worthy of our great Apostle, who
breatheth nothing but Sanctity, nothing but
Holiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus having fortified my Premises, I
should immediately proceed to deduce my
Conclusion; but (that) before I do so, it
may not be amiss to consider one</hi> Question;
<hi>which is: [Why,</hi> Seeing the Sign and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Covenant of Promise, was the Sign
and Token of it not only on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Part,
to whom it was made; but on <hi>God's,</hi> who
made it: Why, since it signified, that <hi>God</hi>
did convey, and make Himself and all His to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> as well as that <hi>Abraham</hi> ought to
restipulate, and surrender, and make himself,
and all his again to <hi>God:</hi> That all along
I do mention but <hi>This,</hi> and not the <hi>Other?]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>This</hi> I answer, That I insist not on
the <hi>Latter,</hi> to exclude the <hi>Former.</hi> I well
know the Sign and Token of the Covenant,
to be a Sign and Token between <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Abraham;</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o as much signifie what
<hi>God</hi> hath promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as what
<hi>Abraham</hi> was obliged to answer. But the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103760:42"/>
Reason I insist <hi>mainly</hi> on the <hi>Latter,</hi> is, That
<hi>It</hi> seemeth mostly (to be) imported in <hi>Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Sign upon Abraham:</hi> For any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sign that <hi>God</hi> had pleased to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, either in the Heavens above, or in
the Earth below, might have been (as the
Bow in the Clouds) a Confirmation of the
Truth of <hi>God,</hi> as Covenanting: But it <hi>Would
not,</hi> with so much Clearness and Significan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
have represented <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Stipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and his assigning and giving of himself
and his again to <hi>God, as Now</hi> it doth; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(that) That in common Sense is <hi>God</hi>'s,
which hath his Sign upon it, and wears his
Mark. And 'tis <hi>as</hi> observable, that as
Circumcision was upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> and on
all his, in token of his Answer and Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
to <hi>God,</hi> (That he did dedicate and
assign himself, and all he had, to him); so
Baptism [the Evangelical, initiating Token]
is on the Person <hi>too</hi> to whom <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>God,</hi>
and signifieth the <hi>same Restipulation</hi> and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
which Circumcision did: The <hi>Which</hi>
many Learned (not improbably) conceive
the Apostle means, when he says, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.
21. That Baptism is <hi>Not the putting away
of the Filthiness of the Flesh, but the Answer
or Restipulation of a good Conscience towards
God:</hi> And so <hi>Beza (ad loc.)</hi> on second
Thoughts doth render it; and <hi>Tertullian</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:103760:42"/>
happily doth allude to it too, when <hi>l. de
Resur. Car.</hi> he tells us, <hi>Anima non Lava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,
sed Responsione sancitur.</hi> Besides,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is a Juridical word, as may be
seen in the Glossary: And though (in
Classick Authors) <hi>It</hi> primarily, and in the
First place, do signifie <hi>Interrogation;</hi> yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>thence,</hi> it came in the Second to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<hi>Stipulation,</hi> (the Sense the Jurists take it
in:) And the Reason is evident; for in
<hi>Spigelius, Stipulatio est firma verborum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio,
quâ quis Aliquid se facturum datu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumve
promittit Alteri super hoc Ipsum</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roganti;
<hi>utpote, promittis mihi te daturum
xx Philippeos? Alter Respondebat, promitto.</hi>
And <hi>Thus</hi> also <hi>Surrenders</hi> and Deditions
were antiently made, as is to be seen (in
<hi>Livy,</hi> l. 1. <hi>c.</hi> 36. and in <hi>Calepine, ad voc.
ded.</hi> out of him) in the Dedition of the
Collatines to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But yet my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
doth not stand and fall with the
Sense of this Text, no more than with that
in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Well then, I have evinced, <hi>That</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Promise, which is the Blessing of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> is the Covenant of Grace, and
<hi>That</hi> it doth descend upon the (true) Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> I have also evinced. That
all who have the Benefit and Advantage of
the Blessing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and are the Seed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103760:43"/>
on whom it doth descend, are equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to the Duty, Office, and Incumbence
arising from the Nature of that Blessing, or
annexed to it, as <hi>Abraham</hi> himself: And
I have evinced, That the Duty, Office, and
Incumbence arising from the Blessing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
in the Covenant of Promise, was,
in Restipulation and Answer to <hi>God,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,
assign, and give himself, and all he
owned, to Him; and, in token of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
Gift, and Assignment, to put the
Sign and Token of the Covenant [the Mark
and Cognizance of <hi>God</hi>] both on himself,
and on them.</p>
            <p>And now take my <hi>Argument,</hi> which is
this: That <hi>Seeing</hi> the Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi>
are the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are Partakers of his Blessing in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Promise confirmed afore in <hi>Christ;</hi>
as is evident in the first Particular: And
<hi>Seeing</hi> the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his Blessing, are under equal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to the Duty, Office, and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence
of that Blessing, as <hi>Abraham</hi> himself
was; which is the Second Particular: And
<hi>Seeing</hi> also, That the Duty, Office, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbence
lying on <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he had the
Blessing, was, that he should both dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and assign, and give himself, and all
his to <hi>God;</hi> and, in token of it, take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103760:43"/>
and put on them the Sign of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
(which is called to keep the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the Sign of it;) which is the
Third. It <hi>Follows,</hi> That the true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and as much Partakers of the Blessing
in the Covenant of Promise, as <hi>Abraham</hi>
himself, are as much obliged to observe and
keep that Covenant of Promise, in the Sign
and Token of it, (be it what it will) as
he himself, and his Natural Seed: That is,
in plain words, Seeing <hi>God</hi> is as much a
<hi>God</hi> to the Believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as he was to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and doth as much give and make
himself, and all he hath to them, as he did
to him; It follows, That they are as much
obliged, by way of Answer, to dedicate
and give themselves, and all they have, to
him; and, in token of it, to take the Sign
of the Covenant between <hi>God</hi> and Them,
or the Cognizance and Token of being
<hi>God</hi>'s, (which <hi>Now</hi> is Baptism) upon <hi>Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
and to put it upon all <hi>Theirs,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
(and to be sure, their Children
are <hi>Theirs</hi>) as <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>Himself</hi> to take
Circumcision, (the Sign and Token of the
Covenant <hi>Then</hi>) and to put it also on <hi>His.</hi>
The same Reason for both: The <hi>Seed</hi> is as
well to keep the Covenant (in the Sign,) as
<hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:103760:44"/>If it could be denied, that Baptism is
now the Sign and Token of the Covenant
of Grace, as Circumcision was heretofore;
I should think it easie to be evinced:
But I assume it as granted, and that both
<hi>Because</hi> Baptism is the Restipulation and
Answer of a good Conscience to <hi>God;</hi> and
<hi>Because</hi> it hath the same Use now, that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
had before, <hi>(viz.)</hi> To be the
Rite of Matriculation, and of Assignation:
And <hi>Because</hi> else (which is hard to think)
there is now no such Sign and Token at
all of the Covenant: Whereas if in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
(<hi>God</hi>'s Sign); in Baptism, the
Name of <hi>God</hi> is put upon us, to mark us for
<hi>His.</hi> And taking it for granted, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Grounds that I have laid, you
may see the Reason, why in the Primitive
Times, <hi>Whole Houses</hi> were Baptized: It is
on the same Account, and for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Whole House</hi> was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcized.
Thus it is said, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 14.
That <hi>Peter should tell Cornelius words, by
which he and all his House should be saved:</hi>
And <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 15. it is said but of <hi>Lydia,</hi>
that she believed; but of Her, and of her
<hi>Houshold,</hi> that they were <hi>Baptized:</hi> And
in <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 31. it is promised to the Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
that on his Faith not only himself, but
his <hi>Houshold</hi> should be saved: <hi>Believe thou
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103760:44"/>
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
saved, and thy House.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 16.
<hi>Paul</hi> Baptized the <hi>Houshold</hi> of <hi>Stephanas:</hi>
And <hi>Christ</hi> himself tells <hi>Zacheus,</hi> on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
That Salvation is come not to his
Person only, but his <hi>House.</hi> I say not, this
is Demonstration; but it seemeth <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
that (ordinarily) when the <hi>Master,</hi>
on his believing, hath a Blessing given him,
his <hi>House</hi> or Family should be joyned with
him. Certainly, the Families of the <hi>Seed</hi>
have the same Relation to them, that the
Family and Houshold of <hi>Abraham</hi> had to
him; and the Incumbence on the Seed, is
the same as on <hi>Abraham;</hi> and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the same.</p>
            <p>And it seems to me, to answer exactly to
the Sentiments of <hi>Some,</hi> concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
given to the Church under the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
that <hi>Magnificent One;</hi> for so <hi>Jer. 30.
21.</hi> should be rendred, and not in the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
as we do read it: To the Letter, it
is not their Nobles, as in our Translation;
but <hi>their Magnificent One,</hi> or <hi>their Noble
One shall be of themselves, and their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
shall proceed from the midst of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now say <hi>They,</hi> the Promise is, That
<hi>when</hi> this Noble and Magnificent One, the
<hi>Shiloe</hi> should come out of the Loyns of
<hi>Juda,</hi> and take the Soveraign Government
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103760:45"/>
and Power, and have the chief Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things in his own Hand; <hi>Then,</hi> in
that Glorious and Evangelical Dispensation,
<hi>their Children should be as afore-time;</hi> or
to the Letter, <hi>As of Old:</hi> Their Children
should be solemnly dedicated, and given
up to <hi>God,</hi> and put into his Protection and
Care; and, in token of it, be Baptized, as
of old, in afore-time, they were Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized:
Which, though it be not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Sense of that Text, (for <hi>of Old</hi> may
look but to the <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi>
as I am apt to think it doth, because the
same word is <hi>Neh.</hi> 12. 46. used in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>It;</hi>) yet it is consonant enough to
the Analogy of Faith.</p>
            <p>For indeed, well may Children in the
Gospel-Dispensation be said, in this Sense,
to be as <hi>afore-time,</hi> and as of old; since
though the <hi>Jews</hi> are cut off, the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
(which believe) are grafted in upon the
same <hi>Stock;</hi> not indeed upon the Legal
<hi>Branch,</hi> but upon the <hi>Root</hi> Olive; which
affordeth all the Nourishment that either
the <hi>Jews</hi> had, or the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have: Which
Root-Olive is the Covenant of Promise;
that Covenant, that Promise, that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Four hundred Years before the Law.
Now, into that <hi>State</hi> of things, as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Promise <hi>Then</hi> held it so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103760:45"/>
the Law, we believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the
true Seed, are put: <hi>Christ</hi> himself affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That <hi>Many shall come from the East,
and from the West, the North, and the South,</hi>
[and those are the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> from
all Quarters,] <hi>and shall sit down with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaac, and Jacob:</hi> He saith not with
<hi>Moses,</hi> and with <hi>Elias,</hi> by whom the Law
came, and was explained; but with the
<hi>Fathers,</hi> who received the Promise: They
shall sit with these in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or Gospel-Church, And in <hi>That
State</hi> of things, when not the <hi>Law,</hi> but
the <hi>Gospel</hi> preached unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<hi>God</hi> was a <hi>God</hi> not only to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but in and through the Father, and
for his <hi>Sake</hi> to the Children, yea, to all the
Family; and the Father of the Family did
not only dedicate and give himself, but all
<hi>His,</hi> his Children, and even his Servants,
all his to <hi>God.</hi> And so it <hi>is Now:</hi> Our
Children are <hi>Thus,</hi> as they were afore-time,
or of old; else indeed our <hi>Children were
unclean, but now are they Holy;</hi> they are
<hi>God</hi>'s. The great <hi>Mistake</hi> of <hi>Antipedo-baptists,</hi>
is, That they look not back but
to the Law, when they should (look back)
a little further, even to the Time of the
Promise, before the Law; a State of things
for the long space of four hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103760:46"/>
Years: For observe, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. from
<hi>Vers.</hi> 31 to 34. when <hi>God</hi> is pleased to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to make a New Covenant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to abolish and abrogate the Old,
he maketh old <hi>not that</hi> Covenant made with
<hi>Abraham</hi> four hundred and thirty Years
before the Law; <hi>but that</hi> which was made
with their Fathers, <hi>In the Day he took them
by the Hand to bring them out of the Land
of Egypt;</hi> which was the Legal Covenant
made on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> Certainly, the New
Covenant, as stated in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> is a <hi>Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, or of the Promise of
the Spirit; <hi>I will he their God, they shall be
my People; I will be thy God, and the God
of thy Seed; and Thou and thy Seed shalt
keep my Covenant:</hi> To keep <hi>God</hi>'s Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
is to be <hi>God</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> those two Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
taking them as Figures, and as in
the Allegory, so they represent not prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and immediately, (as you apprehend
them) the State of single Persons; as if the
<hi>Latter</hi> should represent the Persons that
truly, and to all intents and purposes, are
Spiritual <hi>Heirs</hi> of the Promise; and the
<hi>Former,</hi> those that are only <hi>so</hi> Externally,
and as they did descend (according to the
Flesh) from <hi>Abraham:</hi> For, if you mind
it, this Distinction of <hi>Seeds</hi> did take no
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103760:46"/>
place, in the Antitype and Truth, before
the Law, for all that long space of above
four hundred Years that did precede it. So
that firstly, they do not signifie single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but <hi>Peoples:</hi> I say, <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi>
are not primarily and immediately the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and Reprobate, (as Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
are commonly taken) but are <hi>Jew</hi> and
<hi>Gentile:</hi> The Seed which is of the Law,
and the Seed which is of the Faith of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi>
According to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. there
are Elect and Reprobate among both
Seeds.</p>
            <p>Yes, <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> do signifie but
Peoples; (namely,) <hi>Ishmael</hi> signifies the
<hi>Jews;</hi> who, being Descendants of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
according to the Flesh, were under
the Bondage of the Law; and so, in the
Mystery, were Children of <hi>Hagar</hi> the
Bond-Woman, as <hi>Ishmael</hi> was in the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
For <hi>Hagar</hi> answereth unto <hi>Sinai,</hi> where
the Law was given: And <hi>Isaac</hi> represents
the believing <hi>Gentiles;</hi> who are no longer
under the Bondage of the Law, but under
the Grace of the Promise; and so, in the
<hi>Mystery,</hi> are the Children of <hi>Sarah</hi> or of
the Free Woman; as being the Children
of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as Others were
of his Body. <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> are the <hi>Two
Covenants</hi> and Dispensations, <hi>[Sinai</hi> and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103760:47"/>
               <hi>Sion;]</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law, and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> under the Gospel, are the <hi>Children</hi>
of <hi>Them,</hi> or <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Isaac.</hi> So that
before the Law, no Distinction in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type
or Mystery of those Two; for the
Children could not be, before the Mothers
were: And therefore, what is this to the
State of the Promise four hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years before? Now, in the Gospel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
freed from the Law, we are put again
into the <hi>State</hi> of the Promise, which was
before; <hi>Christ</hi> the Seed, the Principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Promise, being now come. <hi>I'le
be a God to Thee, and thy Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have finished my Argument: But
happily, in Evasion of it, (for it cannot be
in Solution of, or Satisfaction to it) you
will persist to say, as you have already;
<q>That the External <hi>Administration</hi> of the
Covenant now being vastly <hi>different</hi> from
what it was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Time; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Incumbence is <hi>so</hi> also: And that
therefore, though believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who
have the Benefit of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant,
and to whom it is made, are under equal
Obligation to that <hi>Proper Duty</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
which is <hi>Now</hi> required of them, as
<hi>Abraham</hi> was to <hi>His;</hi> yet it follows not,
that their Infant-Seed are under the same
Obligation, according to the Gospel-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103760:47"/>
till put into the same Capacity
(by believing) with themselves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But how pertinently this is said, I do not
see: For to what Proposition in my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can this your Answer be adjusted and
applied? Besides, it goes upon a Mistake
much vaster than the Difference between
the External Administration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Time, and that in Ours:
For I know no other Difference in respect
of the Sign of it, but that Circumcision
then <hi>Was</hi> that Sign, and that Baptism <hi>Is</hi>
now. Nor will any <hi>Difference</hi> in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Administration, if it should be much
greater, make <hi>Any</hi> as to the Argument,
from the Duty and Incumbence which I
insisted upon, (which is, To keep the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in the Sign of it, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did)
for this Incumbence and Duty is not bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
and grounded on the <hi>Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the Covenant, which is mutable, and
doth differ; but on the <hi>Substance</hi> and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it, which is immutable and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
the same; <hi>[I will be a</hi> God <hi>to Thee,
and to thy Seed:]</hi> And <hi>God</hi> being as much
a <hi>God</hi> to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he was
to <hi>Abraham</hi> himself; the Seed are as much
obliged to the Duty, Office, and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence
arising and resulting from his being so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as ever <hi>Abraham</hi> was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:103760:48"/>Ay, you will say; <q>The believing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
on whom the Blessing and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Abraham</hi> doth descend, are as
much obliged to that <hi>Proper Duty</hi> and
Service, which is <hi>Now</hi> required of them,
as <hi>Abraham</hi> was to <hi>His Then;</hi> Yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
not, (I use your own words) that
<hi>[Their Infant-Seed are under the same
Obligation, according to the Gospel-Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
till put into the same Capacity (by
be ieving) with themselves.</hi>
               </q>] And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
it follows not, that the <hi>Infant-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
are under the same <hi>Obligation;</hi> for
<hi>They</hi> are under <hi>None:</hi> The Obligation is
not on the Children, which are but passive:
But it follows well enough for the <hi>Parents</hi>
that believe, that the same Obligation lies
on <hi>Them,</hi> they being the true <hi>Seed,</hi> to keep
the Covenant in the Sign of it, both by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it upon themselves, and by putting
of it on their Children, that did of old up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Abraham</hi> for himself and his. And <hi>This</hi>
is the <hi>Proper</hi> Duty and Service required of
them, as they are Partakers of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Nor are we to expect
any <hi>New</hi> Commands in the Gospel Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
for Duties settled of <hi>Old</hi> on lasting
and immutable Reasons: The Obligation
abides, if the Reason of the Precept abides;
a Principle that is the Ground of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103760:48"/>
Reasoning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8, 9, 10. And shall
the Promise indeed abide, and not the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which arises from it? The Covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide,
and not the Restipulation, without
which it is not a Covenant? This you dare
not say.</p>
            <p>Ay, but you will tell me again; <q>Tho'
you do acknowledge, that the Proper
Duty and Incumbence arising from the
Covenant, hath an Eternal Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the true Heirs of Promise; and in
particular, That such are bound by way
of Restipulation, not only to assign, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,
and give themselves to <hi>God;</hi> but
also, all that is Theirs: Yet that you
do mean, that it <hi>Must only be in the way
that he himself hath appointed,</hi> (and who,
I pray, ever meant otherwise?) and that
is (say you) but <hi>by Prayer and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for them,</hi> and by <hi>Educating</hi> of them
(as far as they are capable) in the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Admonition of the <hi>Lord;</hi> and
<hi>Not</hi> by the Parent's putting on them any
Sign of the Covenant, <hi>as a Badge,</hi> and
Cognizance of <hi>God,</hi> in Recognition and
Testimony of his Right and Title to
them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But all this is but to deny the Conclusion,
after Concession of the Premises; for I
have evinced, that the <hi>Proper Obligation</hi> of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103760:49"/>
the Covenant, and in the way that <hi>God</hi>
himself hath appointed, is, That those with
whom it is immediately made, and who
are first Partakers of the Benefits of it, to
whom <hi>God</hi> is firstly and immediately a <hi>God,</hi>
are not only to dedicate and give themselves,
and all they have to Him; but to do it in this
<hi>Particular way</hi> &amp; manner, by keeping of the
Covenant in the Sign of it; <hi>[I will be a</hi> God
<hi>to Thee, and thy Seed; Thou shalt keep my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
therefore, Thou and thy Seed:]</hi> So
that, to dedicate and give our Infant-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to <hi>God</hi> by Prayer and Supplication,
and to educate and bring them up in the
Fear and Admonition of the <hi>Lord,</hi> (which
also must be done, and which <hi>Abraham</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
did) is not to answer the Obligation and
Incumbence of the Covenant, if we do not do
it also <hi>Solemnly,</hi> by keeping of the Covenant
in the Sign thereof our selves, and by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of it also on <hi>Them. God</hi> loves <hi>Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
it makes for his External Glory: He
will be <hi>Owned</hi> to be our Lord and Owner,
and the Lord and Owner of our Children,
by our taking of his Name upon us our
selves, and by putting of it on them.</p>
            <p>And whereas you have said, with a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
as great as the Truth of what you
say; <q>That, if my Argument be truly sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and as (without wresting) it ought,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103760:49"/>
the proper Language of it will be this;
That <hi>Abraham</hi> being in Covenant, was
to be Circumcized both himself and <hi>Half</hi>
his Family; the same Covenant descends
on believing <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Therefore, they
are to be signed, and the <hi>Whole</hi> of theirs.
But whether such an Argument as this,
(This being, you say, the <hi>True State</hi> of
the Case) be convincing or no, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to my Second Thoughts.</q>]</p>
            <p>I answer: That I have Reason to be at
the utmost Degree of Despair, of ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of any good Answers from <hi>You,</hi> as
long as (from what Cause I now enquire
not) you understand an <hi>Argument</hi> no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
For <hi>Mine</hi> (even in <hi>Your</hi> Terms of
<hi>Half</hi> and <hi>Whole</hi>) would run thus: If <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and all his Seed, must keep the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in the Sign of it, by taking it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and putting it on all theirs that are
capable of it; Then, though <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
but <hi>Half</hi> his Family, (for so you compute
it) did keep it in the Sign thereof, as long
as Circumcision was that Sign; yet the
Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the true Believing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi>
and the <hi>Whole</hi> of theirs, must keep it
now. Now, that Baptism is the Sign, the
Sequel is evident: For as but <hi>Half</hi> of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Family was capable of Circumcision,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103760:50"/>
the Sign of the Covenant <hi>Then; All</hi> the
Off-spring of the Believing Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
are <hi>Capable</hi> of Baptism, which is the
Sign of it <hi>Now.</hi> And observe it; I argue
not from Circumcision, as it is Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to Baptism; but I argue, that because
the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by vertue of the
Covenant, were signed with the Sign of it;
which then was Circumcision: Therefore,
the Children of the Seed, by vertue of the
same Covenant, must be signed with the
Sign of it too; which now is Baptism: For
the Immediate Obligation is not to keep
the Covenant either in Baptism, or in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision;
but in the Sign of it: Now the
Sign of <hi>Old</hi> was Circumcision, and the Sign
<hi>Now</hi> is Baptism. It is true, had it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>God</hi> to have abolished Circumcision, the
<hi>Sign</hi> before, and not to have instituted
Baptism, which is the <hi>Sign</hi> now; it would
have been a high Presumption in any Person,
to go about to make <hi>One:</hi> But when the
Covenant remains, and the <hi>Proper</hi> Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant, is to keep it in the
<hi>Sign</hi> thereof; and <hi>God,</hi> though he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away <hi>One Sign,</hi> yet hath pleased to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
<hi>Another;</hi> What can be plainer, than
that as to be in Covenant is our Priviledge,
so that to observe and keep it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Sign</hi> thereof is our Duty? Thus you
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103760:50"/>
have my Second Thoughts, and make the
most of them.</p>
            <p>So much by way of Obviation to what
you do object to my <hi>Argument.</hi> I am now
to reply to <hi>Yours;</hi> and it is <hi>ad Hominem:
(viz.)</hi> 
               <q>Either the Children of Believers
are in Covenant with their Parents, or
they are not: If they are in Covenant, as
you say I affirm they are, because I said
the Children of Believers are Holy, not
without <hi>God</hi> in Covenant, but given to
<hi>God</hi> in Covenant; then say you, They
are the <hi>Spiritual Seed,</hi> and <hi>as such</hi> enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
to the Covenant and Blessing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
which I formerly denied, and
which cannot be for fifteen Reasons. But
on the contrary, if I say the Children of
Believers are not the Spiritual Seed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and consequently such as are
not <hi>(You should have added, On that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,)</hi>
any wise intituled unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Covenant and Blessing; then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can they justly pretend to any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
Holiness by Vertue of their Birth
Priviledge; which yet <hi>[You say, but
Mistakingly]</hi> I make the Ground of their
Admission to Baptism, when I say, That
<hi>God</hi> becometh not related unto any; nor
is any related unto <hi>God</hi> in Scripture, so
as to be stiled Holy, but in and through
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103760:51"/>
the Covenant.</q>] Thus I am in a <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
and driven from Corner to Corner; but
safe in none.</p>
            <p>But pray consider, that I never said, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
directly or in consequence, That the
<hi>Children</hi> of Believers are <hi>Immediately</hi> and
firstly in the Covenant of Promise, and <hi>as</hi>
their Parents (are:) I only said, and still
do, that they are dedicated and given by
their Parents to <hi>God,</hi> (who is) in Covenant
(with those Parents:) And yet for all this,
even in my Opinion, <hi>They</hi> may pretend
[if that must be the word] to <hi>Some</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by vertue of the Covenant of Promise;
and <hi>This</hi> too, though they be not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Spiritual Seed: For though they be
not themselves the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
yet <hi>being</hi> the Children of those that
are, they become, <hi>thereby,</hi> intituled to the
Priviledge of being <hi>Dedicated</hi> and Sacred
to <hi>God,</hi> by vertue of the Covenant; in the
<hi>Same</hi> Right, and all, as much as the Slaves
and Natural Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> were.
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Children and Slaves
were intituled on <hi>His</hi> Account; and the
Children of <hi>Believers</hi> are intituled on <hi>Theirs.</hi>
The true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to dedicate their Children, not as <hi>His,</hi>
but as <hi>Theirs;</hi> they give <hi>Theirs,</hi> as he gave
<hi>His.</hi> I pray, were not the Natural Seed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103760:51"/>
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Slaves also, <hi>some way
Holy</hi> in and through the <hi>Covenant,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Dedication and Signing which
<hi>That</hi> obliged to? And as <hi>His</hi> Children and
Slaves were <hi>some way</hi> Holy, so are <hi>Ours</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so.</p>
            <p>And in this Sense of <hi>Federal</hi> Holiness,
as it is a <hi>Relative</hi> and External Holiness, do
I ascribe it to our Children, in and through
the Covenant; namely, as <hi>This</hi> obliges the
Parent to assign and dedicate them, and
they accordingly are dedicated: And to be
Federally Holy in this Sense, they need not
sure be the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
seeing All, even the Natural Children of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> [though <hi>so</hi> Holy] were not all
accounted for <hi>Seed.</hi> In fine; Observe, that
if by vertue of the Dedication required of
<hi>Abraham</hi> by the Covenant made with him,
his Children were Members of the Church
<hi>Then, [Old-Testament-Church,</hi> you call it]
it will follow, that by vertue of the same
<hi>Covenant,</hi> making the same Obligation and
Incumbence of Dedication, (if <hi>It</hi> be still in
force, as I have evinced it to be) the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Seed continue Members <hi>still,</hi>
even in the <hi>New-Testament-Church:</hi> And
well they may, not only <hi>for that</hi> the Church
is <hi>One,</hi> and the same, though the <hi>Testaments</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:103760:52"/>
be not; but for that Children were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Members of the <hi>Jewish</hi> or Legal Church,
but of the <hi>Gospel-Church,</hi> for above four
hundred Years before the Law: For it
was Gospel that was <hi>Preached to Abraham,</hi>
Gal. 3. 8. And therefore Circumcision was,
at first, a <hi>Gospel-Sign.</hi> And remember, I
make not the <hi>Childrens</hi> being in Covenant,
the <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>their</hi> Baptism; but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
being in Covenant, the <hi>Ground</hi> of
<hi>Their</hi> Holiness. To be Baptized is the
Children's <hi>Priviledge;</hi> but it is the Parent's
<hi>Duty</hi> to Baptize them, and to put the
Name of <hi>God</hi> upon them, in token that by
their Assignment they are His.</p>
            <p>Well; <q>But you find not any <hi>Mention</hi>
of Infants-Baptism in the Apostolical and
Primitive Times; nor any positive and
literal Precept for it.</q>] But do you find
any mention, that the Apostles themselves,
<hi>All</hi> of them were Baptized with <hi>Any,</hi> or
<hi>Any</hi> of them with the <hi>Baptism of Christ?</hi>
Or that Women were admitted to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the <hi>Lord?</hi> Or any positive literal
Precept for either? And yet, I hope, you
believe, both that the Apostles were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and that Women were not excluded
from the Holy Communion. And if you
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103760:52"/>
do not find in so many literal Expressions,
that Infants were then Baptized, you may
find it in sufficient <hi>Implication;</hi> for you may
find <hi>Whole Houses</hi> (of which <hi>Ordinarily</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
are Constituent Parts) affirmed to be
so, and that frequently, and without any
<hi>Exception</hi> of Infants; <hi>which</hi> yet ought to
have been made, if it had been but for <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
on supposal that it were so dangerous
a thing as you would have it be thought,
to understand them included. Besides, the
Churches of <hi>Christ universally</hi> have had such
a Custom, and for ought appears, <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually:</hi>
Sure we are from Immemorial
Time, which is enough to prescribe from;
and you cannot but know what <hi>Austin</hi> says
in the Case.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> upon the whole I pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that in all the Scripture, as there is
no express and positive Text, that Children
must be Baptized; so there is no express
and positive Text, that doth forbid their
Baptizing: And therefore, it can be only
consequence to Evidence, either that they
ought to be Baptized, or that they ought
not. And let be weighed, <hi>That Antipedo-baptism</hi>
makes the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> but a
Church <hi>Vnius Aetatis: That</hi> it robs the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103760:53"/>
Parent of a sensible Ground of Hope for his
Child, in case of Decease in Infancy; which
is, That he hath solemnly given him to
<hi>God,</hi> and made him his Care: And <hi>It</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
the Child of a solemn and powerful
Motive, when he is of Age, to dedicate
and give himself: For this is a great One,
[and this it deprives him of:] I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
solemnly given to <hi>God</hi> in Baptism
by my Parents, who had Right to give
me: I am <hi>His</hi> by their <hi>Dedication,</hi> and
that publickly made and attested; and
therefore, I have Reason to become <hi>so</hi> by
my <hi>Own.</hi> I am not mine Own; the Name
of <hi>God</hi> is upon me; I am marked for
His; and I must rob <hi>God</hi> of what is His
own <hi>Already</hi> by many Rights, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
by a Solemn Act of my Parents,
if I now refuse my Consent, and do not
also assign, and dedicate, and give my
self to Him.</p>
            <p>And let it <hi>also be weighed,</hi> That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are no more uncapable of Baptism,
than they were of Circumcision: For
if Baptism be the Sign and Seal of the
Righteousness by Faith; so was Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
<hi>If Then</hi> all were not <hi>Israel,</hi> that
were of <hi>Israel;</hi> so it is <hi>Now,</hi> all in
<hi>Christ</hi> are not <hi>Christ: If Then</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103760:53"/>
which was of the Fathers, or a
Sign and Token of the Promise made to
<hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> were taken
and put unto the Law; Baptism, which
was of <hi>John,</hi> the last Prophet, and in use
<hi>before John,</hi> as a Rite of <hi>Initiating Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,</hi>
and administred both to Male and
Female, <hi>Is</hi> taken by <hi>Christ,</hi> and put to
the Gospel: And <hi>if</hi> Faith be made in the
Gospel, the Ground and Foundation of
Baptism, <hi>Believe and be Baptized; It</hi> was
at first the Ground and Foundation of
Circumcision: For <hi>Abraham believed</hi> God,
<hi>and it was accounted to him for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and he received the Sign of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
the Seal of the Righteousness by
Faith; which he had, being yet Vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcized.</hi>
And <hi>if</hi> the Children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
were Holy, Ours are not Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</p>
            <p>In a word: As heretofore there were
<hi>Jews</hi> outwardly, and but visibly, as well
as inwardly and really; so now there
are Christians outwardly, and but visibly,
as well as inwardly and really. And is
not Baptism it self, as external and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Thing as Circumcision? Yes, there
is a <hi>Baptism</hi> and Regeneration of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:103760:54"/>
which is external and visible, to make
Christians visibly and externally, as well
as one of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> which is Internal and
Invisible, to make real and true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
The <hi>Former,</hi> that initiates into the
External and Visible Church: The <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
into the true Assembly of the First
Born: And the Subjects of the Two Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms
are no more to be confounded, than
the Baptisms themselves.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you all the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that under a great variety of distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
and surprizing Accidents, I was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of giving; and I have done it with
the Temper and Moderation that becomes
a Seeker of Truth; without the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Pomp</hi> of Figures, Insolence, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph:
a <hi>Thing</hi> searce pardonable in the
Heat and Fervency of a <hi>Dispute;</hi> but
which doth very ill become a <hi>Writer.</hi>
And yet, if I had used any <hi>Warmness</hi> in
the <hi>Argument,</hi> seeing it is in the Case of
<hi>Infants,</hi> that cannot speak for themselves,
it had been somewhat Excusable; and
the rather, for that our Saviour was so
Zealous for them Himself, that when <hi>some</hi>
(it may be of your Perswasion) would
not have had them brought unto Him to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103760:54"/>
be Blessed, it is said, He was much <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased</hi>
with <hi>Them.</hi> But I am not <hi>so</hi> with
You, for that Occasion you have given of
searching out the Truth to,</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOurs of <hi>March 16th,</hi> came to hand
the <hi>20th;</hi> in which the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
you begin with, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all that I have said,
your Apprehensions concerning the Matter
in dispute between us, are the same they
were, and <hi>That</hi> rather you are the more
confirmed; doth no whit surprize me. I
assure you, I never had the vanity to hope,
to convince a Man of your Perswasion. I
was not the first Aggressor: I well knew
the Confidence, that goes along with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits</hi>
of higher Administrations; and I also
knew, that some <hi>Dyes</hi> and Tinctures of
Mind, (of which I took, and do take <hi>That</hi>
of Yours to be <hi>One</hi>) are as uncapable of
being washed out, as <hi>Those</hi> in the Skins of
Leopards and Blackamoors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:103760:55"/>After a <hi>Smoothing</hi> Preface, you proceed
to (as you call them) <hi>Sober,</hi> and (you hope)
<hi>Inoffensive Reflections;</hi> which yet, to deserve
the <hi>Epithetes</hi> you give them, must have
been composed of Ethicks, as well as of
Logick; must have been Reflections on Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
only, without any squinting on
Persons; and must have consisted of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, than of Ambuscadoes of words,
of bold Assertions without Proof, of Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in stead of direct Answers, of Partial
Repetitions, and of Triumphs before the
Victory. These are the <hi>Arts</hi> and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of <hi>Imposture,</hi> used to deceive the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;
but very improper in Inquiries after
Truth; and of no Influence, no Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the least, on prudent and more Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Discerners.</p>
            <p>Your First <hi>Reflection is on the Caution
which I gave you, about mis-improving my
Concession:</hi> And here, after all the Evasion,
Circumlocution, and Wood of Words, in
which you think to hide; it is certain still,
that either those Pious and Learned <hi>Men,</hi>
who prove the Baptism of Infants from their
being the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> do by the
Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> mean as you and I do,
or they do not; and if they do not, as you
do not, you dare not say but they <hi>do not;</hi>
especially your <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Opponents, (of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103760:56"/>
which I would be principally understood;)
Then should you raise a thousand times
more Cloud and Dust than you have; yet
still it would be visible, that all your <hi>Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Arguments</hi> against Infants being the
<hi>Spiritual Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> in your Sense, and
my <hi>Concession</hi> that they are not <hi>so</hi> in that
<hi>Sense,</hi> do in no degree affect those Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and Worthy <hi>Persons:</hi> For <hi>They</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Spiritual Seed in one Sense, and You
and I in another; <hi>They</hi> for Persons of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<hi>Consideration,</hi> and some way Holy,
and <hi>You</hi> and <hi>I</hi> for <hi>Actual Believers;</hi> though
you may think you do oppose them, and
also that I do; yet indeed you do not; nor
I neither: for Opposition must be <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
Idem.</hi> Ay! <q>But (say you) the Sense
in which <hi>They</hi> call Infants the Spiritual
Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is a Sense the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
knows nothing of.</q> But, say I, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that be so or no, is still in question
between <hi>You;</hi> and were it out of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as you would have it, what were that
to me, who neither did, nor do insist on
that Argument? But in question it is, and
like to be so for all that You, or any of
Yours have hitherto said; nor are <hi>They</hi>
without Scriptural Grounds. For are not
the Children of Believing Parents <hi>some ways
Christ's?</hi> And can they be <hi>so,</hi> and no ways
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103760:56"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed? Can they be <hi>Relatively</hi>
Holy, and Persons of a Religious Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or Church-Members in the Gospel-Dispensation,
(as the Reverend, most A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
Learned, and Pious Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath
abundantly proved them,) can they be <hi>so,</hi>
and no ways <hi>Christ</hi>'s? Are not the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Christians,</hi> as much Christians <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally;</hi>
as the Children of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were
<hi>Jews Externally?</hi> And are there not in
<hi>Christ,</hi> Branches that do not bring forth
Fruit? That is, Are there not <hi>Reputed</hi>
Christians, which are <hi>so</hi> but by External
Profession, and not by Actual Faith, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
True, Spiritual Regeneration? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all are not <hi>Israel,</hi> that are of <hi>Israel;</hi>
All are not <hi>Christ,</hi> that are in <hi>Christ.</hi> I say
not <hi>This,</hi> as willing to insist on that <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
but to evidence, with how much
Justice, as well as with how great Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
you speak by occasion of <hi>It,</hi> of my
<hi>Darkning Counsel without Knowledge:</hi> And,
with a Candour truly yours, and much to
the purpose, add; <q>That a Man may make
a Shift, 'tis true, by means of such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
to avoid the Dint of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
Argument, in his own Conceit
at least; but unless the Distinction be a
well-grounded Distinction he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
so much to subserve the Truth, as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103760:57"/>
his own Credit thereby.</q> A <hi>Very Sober</hi>
and <hi>Inoffensive Reflection!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In your next, instead of <hi>Admiration</hi> how
<hi>Capable</hi> comes in, you are greatly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that it should be thought you said, It
must not be <hi>in</hi> in the <hi>Major;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tell me, with some <hi>Emotion;</hi> 
               <q>That
you shall only need to say, and which I
my self do know to be true, That you
did not at all <hi>Admire</hi> how <hi>Capable</hi> came
into my <hi>Major</hi> Proposition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but how
into the <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
               </q>] As if, had it been
<hi>so</hi> indeed, it had been a Prodigy in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
to have a <hi>Term</hi> in the Conclusion,
that had been in one of the Premises. But
to answer in your own <hi>Figure</hi> of speaking:
You cannot but know, that in the Place
you Animadvert upon, and where I used
the term <hi>Capable,</hi> I made no <hi>Syllogism</hi> at
all; and so distinguished not the <hi>Major,</hi> the
<hi>Minor,</hi> and the <hi>Conclusion;</hi> but only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
a Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10. Nor is the
Argument I make, to be disposed into but
<hi>One;</hi> it doth consist of <hi>Many Syllogisms:</hi>
and what is a <hi>Conclusion</hi> in one Syllogism,
may (I hope) be a <hi>Major</hi> Proposition in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>But you proceed: <q>Whereas you tell
me, <hi>(say you)</hi> That my <hi>Admiration</hi> is
more the Object of Yours; after I have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103760:57"/>
granted, that <hi>God</hi> commanded <hi>Abraham,
Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore,
thou and thy Seed,</hi> in <hi>General Terms,</hi>
wherein <hi>Both</hi> Sexes may seem to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended;
you should have added, to
have done well, <hi>[As if I had not]</hi> that
which follows also, That yet it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the <hi>Males</hi> only were to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually</hi>
signed: And therefore to say,
That the <hi>Females</hi> were <hi>Vertually</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively
signed, in the Circumcision of
the <hi>Males,</hi> is not to the purpose; for
according to that Rule, the <hi>Females</hi>
should be only <hi>Virtually</hi> and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
not Actually <hi>Baptized.</hi> And in
this Respect therefore, to say as you
now do, That the putting of the Sign
on all those in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, that
were capable of it; and the wearing of
it by those, may be <hi>[I said, must be]</hi>
interpreted the putting of it on all; can
be of <hi>no Advantage</hi> at all, in the present
Dispute.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this Paragraph, I have again an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Instance</hi> of your great <hi>Candour,</hi> and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
which will be very <hi>Manifest,</hi> when
I have told you, That notwithstanding a
<hi>Sly Insinuation</hi> to the contrary, I did <hi>add,</hi>
and that in Terms sufficiently expressive,
more than once, that the <hi>Males only were
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103760:58"/>
Actually signed,</hi> with Circumcision; or else,
how could I argue as I did, and you grant
I did, That the <hi>Females</hi> must be <hi>understood</hi>
to be so <hi>Reputatively;</hi> For if the Females
were signed but in <hi>Reputation,</hi> and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
the Males only could be <hi>Actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
signed. And to confirm all I have now
said, I need but <hi>Repeat</hi> the Argument I
made before, which was as follows. <hi>[But
your</hi> Admiration <hi>is more the Object of mine:
After you have granted, that</hi> God <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
Abraham, (Thou shalt keep my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
therefore, thou and thy Seed) <hi>in</hi>
General Terms; <hi>wherein, say you,</hi> Both
Sexes <hi>may seem to be comprehended, (and
indeed, I say, are so:) For if he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in</hi> General Terms, <hi>that</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi>
All his (Seed, <hi>you say) should keep the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
in the</hi> Sign <hi>and Token of it; and
yet, afterward, did Institute Circumcision to
be</hi> that <hi>Sign and Token, which</hi> [Mark this]
<hi>was not competent to All. How can the</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
<hi>of the Precept, (Thou shalt put the
Sign on</hi> All <hi>Thine, when Circumcision, that
is not competible to All,</hi> [Mark that again]
<hi>is that Sign) be understood</hi> Accommodously
<hi>and conveniently, as it must be, but thus;
Thou shalt put the Sign on</hi> All <hi>thine that are</hi>
Capable <hi>of it; and the wearing of it by</hi>
These, <hi>shall be</hi> interpreted <hi>and understood
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103760:58"/>
the putting of it on</hi> All.] Thus, as <hi>Now,</hi>
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are <hi>Counted</hi> for Seed; so <hi>Then,</hi>
the Females were <hi>Counted</hi> for signed. This
was the <hi>Sense</hi> I gave, and This the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with which I urged it: If you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
not the Sense, why did you not
reply to the Argument, and give a Sense
more congruous? But if you do approve
<hi>It,</hi> why, in your Answer, do you cloud
and darken it with words, and make as if
you disowned it as a False <hi>One?</hi> But a
true Sense it is, you do not, you dare not
deny it. Ay, but if true, you say, <hi>It is
not to the Purpose.</hi> That, I grant, may be;
not to <hi>Your</hi> Purpose, but sufficiently to
<hi>Mine.</hi> 
               <q>No, (say you) not to That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for then the Females should only
be reputatively Baptized, because they
were only reputatively Circumcized.</q>]
As if Females were not <hi>Actually</hi> to wear
a Sign they are equally capable of with the
Males, because they were but <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi>
to wear a Sign they were not capable
of but <hi>so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far I have followed you step by
step, and written in a Fashion not mine own,
but yours; both to make you sensible of
the great Provokativeness, and of the as
great Unfitness and Undecency of it. But
I am weary of this <hi>Drudgery;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103760:59"/>
in what remains, resolve to content
my self with summing up the Substance of
what you offer; and that as well <hi>without</hi>
improper Reflections, as <hi>with</hi> all the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Fulness I can; and so return my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers.</p>
            <p>The first thing offered by you of any
moment, is to <hi>This Sense;</hi> 
               <q>That the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Obligation</hi> which was laid upon
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and his <hi>Seed</hi> after him in their
Generations, was <hi>not</hi> to keep the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in the Sign of <hi>It</hi> in <hi>General Terms,</hi>
as I would have it; <hi>but</hi> only to keep
the Covenant in that <hi>Particular Sign</hi> of
Circumcision; there being (say you) no
other Sign mentioned or implied, but
that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10, in which the latter
words are only <hi>Exegetical</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<hi>Thou shalt keep my Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
&amp;c. in the <hi>9th.</hi> Verse; and <hi>how</hi> the
<hi>10th.</hi> explains, namely in <hi>Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And seeing this Objection hath something
in it very pertinent, (for I will do you all
the Right imaginable) I hold my self obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in order to the removing of it, and
consequently to the further illustrating and
clearing of my Argument, to shew; First,</hi>
That the <hi>Immediate Obligation</hi> and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence
mentioned in the 9th Verse, cannot be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103760:59"/>
to keep the Covenant in, but Circumcision;
and consequently, that what is said Verse the
10th, is not meerly Exegetical of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
in the 9th. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Obligation and Incumbence in the
9th. Verse, is to keep the Covenant in the
Sign of it: this is Primary: And then, that
that which is added in the 10th. Verse, is
but a <hi>Secondary</hi> Institution of a Particular
Sign, for that time. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will
shew, That there is a plain <hi>Intimation,</hi> and
consequently more than a meer hint, that
some other Sign must be observed by the <hi>Seed,</hi>
than that of Circumcision.</p>
            <p>As for the First; <hi>That the Immediate,
Primary Obligation and Incumbence, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the 9th. Verse, cannot be to keep
the Covenant in Circumcision only; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
that the 10th. is not meerly Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical
of the 9th. is evident:</hi> For if the
<hi>Primary</hi> and Immediate Obligation in the
<hi>9th.</hi> Verse, were to keep the Covenant in
<hi>Circumcision,</hi> then the believing <hi>Gentile</hi>
shou'd be as much obliged to keep the
Covenant <hi>so,</hi> as the <hi>Carnal Seed</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants
of <hi>Abraham;</hi> seeing <hi>Those</hi> are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
at least, if not more principally
comprehended in the Seed, than <hi>These.</hi>
This is evident; for the <hi>Subject</hi> of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi>
is, in all respects, the same with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103760:60"/>
               <hi>That</hi> of the <hi>Promise.</hi> [In the <hi>Promise</hi> it is,
<hi>I will establish my Covenant between Me and
Thee, and thy Seed after Thee, in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations:</hi>
and in the <hi>Obligation</hi> it is; <hi>Thou
shalt keep my Covenant therefore, Thou and
thy Seed after thee, in their Generations:</hi>
The same Subject in all respects in Both.]
And therefore, seeing the Subject of the
<hi>Promise</hi> is, at least, as Comprehensive of
the Spiritual, as of the Carnal Seed, of
the <hi>Gentile</hi> that believeth, as well as of
the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> the <hi>One</hi> is no more to be
exempted and discharged from the <hi>Duty</hi>
and <hi>Obligation,</hi> than the <hi>Other:</hi> and if
<hi>Circumcision</hi> be that Duty and Obligation,
<hi>Both</hi> are equally bound to submit to <hi>That.</hi>
All the Seed is in the <hi>Obligation,</hi> as much
as in the <hi>Promise,</hi> the same words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it; and, I hope, you will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish,
nor limit, where the Scripture
doth not.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>Immediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi>
of the Covenant cannot be (as you
may see it cannot) to keep it in, <hi>but Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision;</hi>
it follows, that <hi>It is to keep the
Covenant in the Sign of it, in general Terms;
and then, afterward, in Circumcision, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with, as the first Sign:</hi> So that, This
must be the <hi>Sense</hi> of the Text: I will
Establish my Covenant between Me and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103760:60"/>
Thee, and thy Seed; and therefore, Thou
and thy Seed shall keep my Covenant, in
the Sign of it: and that Sign at first, and
for the time being, the present Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among <hi>Those</hi> that shall descend from
Th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> according to the Flesh, or be adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hem</hi> shall be Circumcision. This
is a fair, a plain, and easie, and natural
Sense; a Sense, which no Exception from
the Words themselves can lie against: and
therefore, a Sense as much to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before Yours, as that which <hi>is Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,</hi>
ought to be before that which is
<hi>Not.</hi> And This I evidenced in my former
<hi>Letter,</hi> from the very <hi>Grammar</hi> of the
Text.</p>
            <p>But besides what I have said in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Letter,</hi> in demonstration of the <hi>Sense</hi>
given; that which doth abundantly confirm
it to be the <hi>True,</hi> is, That the <hi>Limitation</hi>
of the Subjects in the <hi>Particular</hi> Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Circumcision, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. is very
<hi>different</hi> from <hi>That</hi> in the <hi>General</hi> Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>ver.</hi> 9. For whereas it was said <hi>Vers.</hi>
the <hi>9th; Thou shalt keep my Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Thou and thy Seed after thee, in their
Generations;</hi> when he comes in the 10th.
to institute Circumcision, he saith not, <hi>This
is my Covenant, which thou shalt keep, Thou
and thy Seed after thee, in their Generations:</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:103760:61"/>
But, <hi>This is my Covenant, which you</hi> (You)
<hi>shall keep between Me and You, and thy Seed
after thee:</hi> And the being of it a Sign and
Token, is restrained also; <hi>And it shall be
a Token or Sign of the Covenant between Me
and You:</hi> A Sign for this Time, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and Administration. He saith not,
for <hi>You,</hi> and for thy <hi>Seed</hi> after thee. If you
say, I am too <hi>Critical;</hi> I say, This is a
Text that must be understood <hi>Critically:</hi>
The Apostle was as Critical upon it as I,
or any Man can be, when he observed, it
is said <hi>Seed,</hi> as speaking of one, and not
<hi>Seeds:</hi> and what he saith, is the proper
<hi>Key</hi> to unlock the Text.</p>
            <p>And yet, in regard the Text hath been
Interpreted by very few in this manner, to
add some more Illumination to the Sense I
make of It, I propose to be considered, that
not only other Scriptures, but even this
Scripture doth make <hi>Distinction</hi> between
the <hi>Family of Abraham that then was</hi> which
in the Mistery represented all his <hi>Carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants,</hi>
(between that) and the <hi>Children
of the Promise,</hi> which were afterwards to
be; which were signified by the <hi>Seed,</hi> and
afterward were typed in <hi>Isaac</hi> the Son of
the Promise; it being said, <hi>In Isaac</hi> (not
in <hi>Ishmael,</hi> who then was) <hi>shall thy Seed be
called.</hi> Now, though <hi>God</hi> had said in the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103760:61"/>
               <hi>9th. Verse, Thou shalt keep my Covenant
therefore;</hi> that is, thou shalt keep the <hi>Sign</hi>
of my Covenant; <hi>Thou and thy Seed after
thee, in their Generations;</hi> to signifie, that
the <hi>Children of the Promise</hi> were obliged to
that Duty and Incumbence arising from the
Covenant, as well as the <hi>Children of the
Flesh:</hi> Yet, when he comes to institute
Circumcision in <hi>Particular,</hi> he saith of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>This is my Covenant:</hi> or, This is
the Sign of my Covenant: But he saith not,
This is my Covenant, which Thou, Thou
and <hi>Thy Seed</hi> after thee, in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
shall keep; but which <hi>You</hi> (You) shall
keep: <hi>You</hi> to whom I speak. Thou <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and thy <hi>Natural Houshold</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<hi>Here;</hi> it is <hi>You,</hi> (You) and not the
<hi>Seed,</hi> the Spiritual Seed: for <hi>Isaac,</hi> in whom
the Seed is called, was not there, he was
yet unborn. It is <hi>You,</hi> (He speaks to those
present;) Thou <hi>Abraham,</hi> and thy Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Houshold and Family; this is the Sign
of my Covenant, which <hi>You</hi> (You) shall
keep, as a Sign of that Covenant which I
have made between <hi>Me and You, and thy
Seed after thee. Me</hi> and <hi>You;</hi> thee <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and thy <hi>Natural Houshold</hi> and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here, between Me and You, and thy
<hi>Seed</hi> after thee; that Seed, which shall be
called in <hi>Isaac,</hi> thy <hi>Spiritual Houshold</hi> and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103760:62"/>
Seed. And what was the <hi>Covenant,</hi> or
Sign of the Covenant, which <hi>They</hi> (and
not the Seed) were to keep then? What?
No other Covenant or Sign, than that of
Circumcision? <hi>This is my Covenant, which
you shall keep, Every Man-Child among you</hi>
(not among the <hi>Seed,</hi> but among <hi>You) shall
be Circumcized; and you shall Circumcize
the Flesh of your Fore-skin: [You</hi> still, not
the <hi>Seed.</hi>] And what was Circumcision
for? It was for a <hi>Sign</hi> and Token of the
Covenant; and to <hi>Whom</hi> it was to be so,
is clearly implied in the <hi>Limitation:</hi> It <hi>shall
be</hi> a Token, a Sign of <hi>the Covenant between
Me and You.</hi> Not Me and You, and thy
Seed after thee. It shall be a Sign and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Covenant, in the Dispensation
of it, which <hi>now is</hi> between Me and You;
not in the Dispensation of it, which <hi>shall
be</hi> between Me and thy Seed: It shall be
a Token of my Covenant, as it is between
Me and You; thee <hi>Abraham,</hi> and thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Houshold and Family: But not as it
is to be transacted between Me, and thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Seed.</p>
            <p>If you say, (for I will say for you all I
can imagine possible to be said, with any
Colour) <q>That the Sense should rather
be this; <hi>This is my Covenant, which you
shall keep:</hi> That is, which <hi>Thou Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:103760:62"/>
and thy <hi>Seed</hi> after thee, in their
Generations, shall keep: <hi>And this
shall be a Sign-and Token between Me
and You;</hi> that is, between Me and Thee,
and <hi>Thy Seed</hi> after <hi>Thee,</hi> in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</q>]
If you say, This is the <hi>Sense</hi>
of the <hi>Text,</hi> I must be plain to tell you,
It cannot be <hi>so;</hi> and that because he doth
so plainly distinguish in <hi>It,</hi> between <hi>You</hi> and
the <hi>Seed: This is the Covenant, which you
shall keep between Me and You, and thy Seed
after thee.</hi> So that <hi>You,</hi> which is so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Contradistinguished</hi> and opposed to the
<hi>Seed,</hi> cannot possibly be understood to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<hi>It.</hi> And it is also considerable, that
he saith, <hi>This is my Covenant, which you shall
keep between Me and You, thy Seed;</hi> not
<hi>Between Me and Thee, and thy Seed:</hi> And
yet it doth refer to <hi>Verse</hi> the <hi>9th.</hi> where
it is said, <hi>Thou shalt keep my Covenant, Thou
and thy Seed.</hi> But here, <hi>You</hi> is put instead
of <hi>Thou,</hi> to signifie that <hi>Thou</hi> in the <hi>9th.
Verse,</hi> must be understood of <hi>Abraham</hi> not
<hi>Personally</hi> only, but <hi>Collectively; Abraham</hi>
standing there for Himself, and his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Family: <hi>Thou,</hi> and thy <hi>Seed,</hi> is <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>Christ; Both</hi> in the Mystery.</p>
            <p>This last Consideration minds me of the
Third Particular to be demonstrated; which
is, That <hi>Another Sign besides that of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103760:63"/>
is clearly intimated in the Text
we discourse on, as a thing that should be
afterwards.</hi> And this is manifest; for
whereas he had said, <hi>That</hi> the <hi>Seed,</hi> as
well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> (and under <hi>Abraham</hi> I
have proved the Natural Off-spring and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of <hi>Abraham</hi> comprehended,) was to
keep the Covenant in the Sign, or to keep
the Sign of the Covenant, in the <hi>9th. Verse;</hi>
and he instituted Circumcision, but to be
a Sign between <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s
Natural Off-spring and <hi>Family;</hi>
and to be kept but by <hi>Them,</hi> and not by
the Spiritual <hi>Seed: [This is the Sign of the
Covenant, which you</hi> (not which <hi>Thou</hi> and
thy <hi>Seed) shall keep; and it shall be a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of my Covenant,</hi> [as] <hi>between Me and
You;</hi> not <hi>[as]</hi> between Me and Thee, and
thy <hi>Seed</hi> after thee.] What remaineth, I
say, <hi>seeing</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> is equally obliged as
well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> to keep the Covenant in
<hi>some</hi> Sign, as was proved before; <hi>and that</hi>
it was not to keep it in the Sign of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
as is evident <hi>Now;</hi> what remaineth,
but that there is some <hi>other</hi> Sign, in which
<hi>It</hi> was to keep it, that should be a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Covenant in that <hi>Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of it, which should be afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Seed;</hi> as Circumcision
was of the same Covenant, but in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103760:63"/>
and Transaction of it, then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Person, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Houshold? Circumcision was the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Covenant, as administred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Abraham;</hi> and Baptism
the Token of the same Covenant, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Seed:</hi> If
<hi>Abraham</hi> was Circumcized, <hi>Christ</hi> was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole; Let us now review the
<hi>Text,</hi> and see it in the entire Sense: And
thus I <hi>Paraphrase</hi> it. I will Establish my
Covenant between <hi>Me</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> and thy
<hi>Seed</hi> after thee, in their Generations, for
an Everlasting Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Thou,</hi> Thou and thy <hi>Seed</hi> after thee,
in their Generations, shall <hi>keep</hi> the <hi>Sign</hi> of
my Covenant: And <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>Sign</hi> of my
Covenant, [That my Covenant, which is
between <hi>Me,</hi> on the <hi>One Part,</hi> and YOU,
thou <hi>Abraham,</hi> and thy Natural Family and
Houshold, on the <hi>Other Part;</hi> and thy <hi>Seed</hi>
after thee, on the <hi>Third Part.</hi>] I say, This
is the <hi>Sign</hi> that YOU, for your part, shall
keep as a Sign of this Covenant, which is
between <hi>Me</hi> and YOU, and thy <hi>Seed</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thee; <hi>Every Man-Child among</hi> You <hi>shall
be Circumcized; and</hi> You <hi>shall Circumcize
the Flesh of</hi> Your <hi>Fore-skin.</hi> And this <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>
shall be a <hi>Special</hi> and Particular
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103760:64"/>
Sign and Token of the Covenant, <hi>as</hi> it is
between <hi>Me</hi> and YOU; between Me and
Thee, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and thy Natural Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.
But as for the <hi>Seed,</hi> no mention of
<hi>It,</hi> when he saith, <hi>This shall be a Sign of
the Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. which sufficiently impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
another Administration to be with <hi>That</hi>
afterward.</p>
            <p>And I pray you mark, that where he
calleth Circumcision the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Vers. 10.
he saith, You <hi>shall keep it between Me and</hi>
You, <hi>and thy Seed;</hi> because the <hi>Covenant</hi>
(of which Circumcision was a <hi>Sign</hi>) was a
Covenant between <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Seed</hi> too,
as well as between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
his Natural Family. But when he saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
It shall be a <hi>Sign</hi> and Token, then
he <hi>restrains</hi> it; <hi>It shall be a Sign of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
between Me and</hi> You: Implying,
that though the Covenant be also with the
<hi>Seed,</hi> and Circumcision was a Sign of that
Covenant; yet it was specially and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
a Sign of it, as transacted between
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Person and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
and so a special and particular Sign
of that <hi>Oeconomy</hi> in the Natural Houshold.
<hi>It shall be a Sign between Me and</hi> You;
[and <hi>not</hi> between Me and You, and thy
<hi>Seed.</hi>] And so much for the First Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:103760:64"/>What you <hi>next</hi> offer in Objection to my
Argument, is; <q>That it follows not, that
because the Substance of the Covenant on
<hi>God</hi>'s Part, is Immutably and <hi>Vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably</hi>
the <hi>same,</hi> (that) therefore the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Incumbence is also <hi>so</hi> on ours:
For seeing <hi>God</hi> hath Absolute Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in and over all his Creatures, and
hath unlimited and boundless Right, as
to command, so to suspend and alter the
Instances and Duties of their Obedience,
both as and when he pleases; that may
be the <hi>Duty</hi> of his People at one time,</q>
[You should have added, to make it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent;
<hi>By vertue of the same Covenant and
Edict, and in the same Respect,</hi>] <q>which
is not so at another. This you <hi>Confirm;</hi>
because else, you see not how it should
come to pass, that for at least two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years before the Time of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
no such Duty or Incumbence did
lie on the Patriarchs; particularly, not
on <hi>Adam,</hi> on <hi>Abel,</hi> on <hi>Enoch,</hi> on <hi>Noah,</hi>
or on the other <hi>Antediluvian Fathers;</hi> of
whom we do not read, that any of them
were <hi>Signed,</hi> or that they were obliged
to any Sign; though you say, It cannot
be denied, that they <hi>were in the Covenant
of Grace,</hi> and saved by <hi>It</hi> as much as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
himself, or any of His. So that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103760:65"/>
here is an <hi>Objection,</hi> and an Enforcement
and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of that Objection.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Objection, <hi>(viz.) That it will
not follow,</hi> (that) <hi>because the Substance of
the Covenant, on</hi> God <hi>'s Part, is immutably
and everlastingly the same; therefore the
Duty and Incumbence on ours, is also such:</hi>
I answer. It will follow <hi>well enough,</hi> if the
Duty and Incumbence on our Part, be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the <hi>Substance</hi> of the Covenant,
which is on <hi>God's</hi> (Part,) as the Duty and
Incumbence in dispute between us <hi>is:</hi> It
being, <hi>I will Establish my Covenant between
Me and Thee, and thy Seed after thee, in
their Generations, for an Everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to be a</hi> God <hi>to thee, and to thy Seed
after thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> God <hi>said unto</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<hi>Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore,
thou and thy Seed after thee, in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi>
For though Almighty <hi>God</hi> be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Soveraign over all our Persons, and
also over all his own Transactions and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
so as he may make at one time to
be our Duty, that which he doth not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and may transact and deal in way of
Covenant with some, when yet he hath
not pleas'd to do so with others: Yet if
at any time, or with any Persons, he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to transact in way of Covenant, and to
confirm that Transaction by his Word and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103760:65"/>
Oath, the two immutable things in which
it is impossible that he should Lye, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to bottom the Duty and Incumbence to
which he doth oblige by vertue of that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
on <hi>that</hi> which is unchangably and
immutably confirmed in <hi>it;</hi> We can no
more, without a Blasphemous Imputation
to him of Inconstancy and Weakness, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
him making an Alteration in the
<hi>Duty,</hi> than in the <hi>Promise</hi> it self, seeing
the <hi>Obligation</hi> to the Duty, is a necessary
result and emanation of the Reason of it,
and consequently, is <hi>uncapable</hi> of being
changed without a change of the Covenant,
the unchangable Promise of God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and to his Seed, is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of
the Duty lying on <hi>Abraham</hi> and on his
Seed; and the same Covenant as the same,
must alwayes have the same effects, and
make the same Duties.</p>
            <p>Ay? but then how came it to pass that
<hi>Adam, Abel, Enoch,</hi> and others the most
Antient Fathers, who were under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace as well as <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his descendants, God being a God to them
as well as to him, did not keep the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in the sign thereof, if the Duty to
keep the Covenant in the sign thereof be
Everlastingly the same, and of an unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
nature? This is your <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:103760:66"/>
               <hi>But to manifest the Invalidity of all is
said by way of Confirmation, I need but
to demonstrate,</hi> First; That though all the
<hi>Fathers</hi> were saved on the account of Iesus
Christ, and by vertue of the <hi>Eternal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact</hi>
and Agreement between God and him,
he being the Everlasting Father; yet (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what you do suppose) it did not please
God, at least not in the <hi>Account of the
Scripture,</hi> to Transact with <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> of
<hi>them,</hi> in way of <hi>Covenant</hi> for Grace, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life and Salvation, <hi>before</hi> he did so
with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That</hi> if he had
been pleased to transact, with all or any of
<hi>them</hi> in way of <hi>Covenant</hi> for those ends;
yet <hi>that</hi> Transaction could not be the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and therefore seeing the
believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> do not claim the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Eternal Life and Salvation <hi>from</hi> by
and under <hi>Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi>
or any other <hi>Covenanted Person</hi> or Persons
<hi>before Abraham</hi> (if there were any such)
but only from, by, and under <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor
by vertue of any <hi>other Covenant</hi> whatever,
made with all or any of them, but only by
vertue of <hi>Abrahams;</hi> It is certain that the
<hi>Termes,</hi> which it pleased God to go upon
with <hi>them</hi> in any transaction he had with
them (be they what they will) <hi>are, in</hi> account
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as <hi>Little</hi> to us, as <hi>those</hi> he
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103760:66"/>
went upon with <hi>Abraham</hi> are <hi>much. And</hi>
Thirdly, <hi>That</hi> the <hi>Obligation</hi> to keep the
Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. in the sign thereof,
though it were not, and indeed could not be
observed by all or any of the Antients before
<hi>Abraham,</hi> yet notwithstanding, that it is in
a <hi>Scriptural</hi> sence, and consequently, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
enough, called a Duty and Obligation
of <hi>immutable</hi> and unchangable nature, and
Everlastingly the same.</p>
            <p>The first Proposition, (viz.) <hi>That though
all that ever were saved, were saved by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Atonement and Propitiation made
by the Blessed Jesus,</hi> He <hi>being in the efficacy
and vertue of his Merits and Passion, the
Lamb slain even from the Foundation of the
World; yet, that,</hi> at least in the Account
of Holy Scripture, <hi>it did not please God to
transact with all, or any of the antient, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Antediluvian or Postdiluvian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in way of</hi> Covenant <hi>for Grace, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life and Salvation before</hi> Abraham, is
a manifest Verity. For <hi>though</hi> all the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
that were <hi>saved,</hi> were so by some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and kind of Faith; and were <hi>so</hi> by
Jesus Christ, and through the <hi>Eternal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
(as Divines call it) of Redemption
between God and him; and <hi>though they</hi> all
did worship and honour God in way of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi>
in all <hi>which</hi> the Blessed Jesus, the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103760:67"/>
true Lamb of God, was figured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented;
and <hi>though</hi> Jesus Christ himself
saith, before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, I am, yet,
<hi>that</hi> it pleased God to transact with <hi>all,</hi> or
any, or either of them, before <hi>Abraham</hi> in
way of Covenant or Promise for Eternal
Life, and Salvation, or, <hi>that</hi> Jesus Christ
was Preached to them, or otherwise exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
then in Types and Figures, (which
we are not told they understood) is <hi>no
where</hi> said or recorded, or so much as hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>whole Scripture.</hi> Our Saviour
saith indeed, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did see his day,
but he saith not, nor do the Scriptures say
that <hi>Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp;c. saw
it. What might be Preached by the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
further then the <hi>Scriptures</hi> tell us, and then
the Holy Ghost is pleased in <hi>them</hi> to Reveal
to us, is no proper subject for our now In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry;
We are now to mind but what is
Preached by the Scriptures, and Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them; Remembring, that the very
<hi>silence</hi> of the Scriptures is Mystical, as is
evident in the case of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> who
though (whatever Learned <hi>Cunaeus</hi> thought)
he were a Man, and consequently was not,
really, <hi>without</hi> Father, without Mother,
without Genealogy, without beginning of
dayes or end of Life; yet for great ends,
(he) is taken and expresly said to be <hi>so;</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:103760:67"/>
and that, because nothing, in the Least, is
written and recorded in the Holy Scriptures
touching him, as to these particulars. And
shew me any Scripture that but hints a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
made with <hi>Adam, Abel, Enoch,</hi>
with all, or any of the Antient Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Abraham,</hi> or Promise made to them,
or any of them, of Grace, Eternal Life
and Salvation, wherein Almighty God did
pass <hi>his word</hi> to be a God to them, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, and their, or either of their
Seed after them. I do not doubt but God
was a God to them all, as I doubt not that
<hi>Melchisedeck</hi> had a Father, Mother, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy,
beginning of dayes, and end of
Life, but as the Holy Scriptures do no
where mention any of <hi>these</hi> in Relation to
<hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> so they no where intimate
that God before <hi>Abraham,</hi> was a God to
any of the <hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> in a way of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
or promise for Grace, Eternal Life
or Salvation, and therefore, the least that
can be said, if we should be prevailed to
acknowledge any such transaction, must be
(seeing the Scripture is so deeply silent in
it) that as there is a <hi>mistery</hi> in the silence of
the Scripture touching <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> so
there is a Mystery in the silence of it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any such Covenant or Promise (if any
such were) to the Fathers; and that as <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck,</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:103760:68"/>
to be a <hi>figure</hi> of the Eternal
Priest, must be brought in in Scripture as
a man dropt out of the Clouds, without
any mention of Father, Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So
likewise, to the end that <hi>Abraham</hi> might
be according to the Scriptures, what in
the Divine Council he was appointed and
set up to be, namely, the <hi>Father</hi> of all the
faithful, or express Believers in Christ,
there must be no record in the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of any Promise of Christ before, as
made to any other; or of any Explicit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and Faith in him before for had there
been either, how could <hi>Abraham</hi> possibly
be understood, in the account of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to have been the Father, and so the
first of all the faithful, of all Believers in
Christ? He only is first before whom no
other is. Christ (I deny not) <hi>may</hi> have
been Preached <hi>before Abraham,</hi> and also
promised by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but he is not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the Scriptures</hi> so to have been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Preached, or Promised: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is entirely silent as to any such Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action;
If any such Covenant or Promise
were of Christ before, certainly in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Scripture it is as none, and so must
be looked on of us as none; not the least
impression or footstep of any such concern
appearing. I acknowledge the old Fathers
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103760:68"/>
to <hi>be said</hi> to have had <hi>faith in God,</hi> but
they are not said to have had any <hi>in Christ,</hi>
and these Faiths are so distinguished, that
they may be Actually divided; <hi>you believe
in</hi> God, sayes Christ, <hi>believe also in me;</hi>
The <hi>Old Fathers</hi> did believe <hi>in God,</hi> they
believed both <hi>that</hi> God <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> he
was a <hi>Rewarder,</hi> but <hi>Abraham</hi> did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe (as they did) <hi>in God,</hi> but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
believed <hi>in Christ.</hi> If you ask me, but
is not God <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a Rewarder in and through
Christ, and not otherwise? I answer yes,
and yet it is possible, they might believe
in God, and not believe in Christ; They
might believe God to be a <hi>Rewarder</hi> (as
some Heathen do) though they did not
know him, and therefore could not believe
him to be <hi>so</hi> but in Christ: That God is,
and is a Rewarder, are Points of <hi>Natural
Religion;</hi> But that Christ is, and God a
Rewarder in Him, are Points of <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I acknowledge that what you say is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
taken for granted, (viz.) <q>
                  <hi>That the
Promise of Christ the Seed of the Woman,
was made to</hi> Adam;</q>] And so much is true,
that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is introduced by the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
as speaking of <hi>himself,</hi> and saying,
that in the Volume of the Book, or (as
some do render it) in the Head of the book
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103760:69"/>
it is written of <hi>him,</hi> and so (though happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Psalmist may have <hi>Aspect</hi> upon some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else) I grant it <hi>is,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. for
when it is there said, that <hi>the Seed of the
Woman shall break the Serpents head,</hi> &amp;c.
It must I confess be understood of Christ,
at least in the Mystery, thus it is written
of him, but that Christ was promised to
<hi>Adam,</hi> is not written; For what is written
in the Volume, or in the head of the Book
concerning Christ, is not written there, as
spoken by way of <hi>Promise</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> but
by way of <hi>denunciation</hi> to the Serpent, and
is part of the <hi>Sentence</hi> pronounced on him;
which if indeed it were <hi>within the hearing</hi>
of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet the Scripture doth not say it
was <hi>so;</hi> So little doth the Scripture concern
<hi>Adam</hi> in that Transaction, how great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
soever, in reality, he was to have in
it. So the Text, Gen. 3. 14, 15. <hi>And
the Lord God said to the</hi> Serpent, &amp;c.
What he sayes to <hi>Adam</hi> is verse 17. 18,
19. and of a very different nature. Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
I acknowledge, there is of Christ,
from the beginning; but in the Record of
the Scripture, that declaration is not noted
as a transaction between God and <hi>Adam,</hi>
by way of Covenant or Promise; All
is said concerning it, is in what did pass
between God and the Serpent, and some
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103760:69"/>
               <hi>ad loc</hi> chuse to call it a <hi>Prophecy,</hi> not a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>
of Christ.</p>
            <p>And <hi>it</hi> adds no little <hi>confirmation</hi> to the
truth of what I have now discoursed, <hi>that</hi>
after the Revelation of Jesus Christ in what
passed between God and the Serpent; we
have not for the long space of above Two
Thousand Years the least Intimation in all
the Scriptures, that any of the Fathers of
that time had heard of that Revelation; (I
do not say they had not heard, but I say
the Scriptures do not so much as hint they
had;) and though the Scriptures tell us,
that in that time <hi>Righteousness</hi> was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet they do not in the least
tell us, that <hi>Christ</hi> was preached by it. And
surely, had the declaration made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ in the Third Gene<gap reason="illegible" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap> been,
in the Account of the Scriptures, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
or Promise of him to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp;c. I
should much admire that the Apostle would
insist so highly (as he doth) on the being of
the Promise of Salvation by Christ for but
some <hi>hundreds</hi> of years before the Law,
when had this been so, he might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on <hi>thousands;</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Peter
dates</hi> the Covenant of Grace from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
Act. 2. 25, 26. and before him, the
<hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal 105. 8, 9, 42.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:103760:70"/>But secondly, on <hi>supposal that it had
pleased God to transact with</hi> Adam, <hi>or any
of the old Fathers before</hi> Abraham, <hi>in way
of Covenant and Promise for grace, Eternal
Life and Salvation; yet that Covenant and
Promise could not be the Covenant of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<hi>in which it pleased God to Promise to
be a God to him particularly, and to his
Seed after him;</hi> For the Covenant of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
could not be before <hi>Abraham</hi> himself
existed: And therefore, seeing the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gentiles do not claim Eternal Life and
Salvation from, by, and under <hi>Adam,</hi> or
any other of the Antient <hi>Fathers</hi> before
<hi>Abraham;</hi> nor by vertue of any <hi>Covenant
Transaction</hi> that hath passed between God
and <hi>them,</hi> or any of <hi>them,</hi> but only from,
by, and under <hi>Abraham,</hi> by vertue of the
Covenant of <hi>Promise</hi> made with him; It
is as clear that the <hi>Termes,</hi> Conditions and
Methods on and in which it pleased God to
transact with all, or any of those old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
(be those termes and methods any
whatever) <hi>(they)</hi> are nothing to <hi>us,</hi> as that
the <hi>Termes,</hi> Conditions and Methods he is
pleased to transact upon with <hi>Abraham</hi> in
the Covenant of Promise, are all in all to
us. That is, in plain English, That it is
nothing in the least to us believing Gentiles,
whether the <hi>Fathers</hi> before the Flood, or
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103760:70"/>
after the Flood before <hi>Abraham,</hi> were in
Covenant or not in Covenant, were signed
or not signed, seeing we claim not <hi>from,</hi>
by, and under <hi>them,</hi> as Heirs to them, but
it is <hi>much</hi> to us, on what <hi>Termes</hi> it pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God to transact and deal with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and under what <hi>Conditions,</hi> and with
what duties <hi>Abraham</hi> did receive the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and Promise, whether himself and
his must be signed or not signed; seeing it
is <hi>from,</hi> by, and under <hi>him,</hi> and by vertue
of the Covenant of Promise made with <hi>him,</hi>
that <hi>we</hi> do claim, and hold. And surely,
if <hi>we</hi> do claim, and hold in, by and under
<hi>Abraham,</hi> by the Deed and Charter made
to him, we must also claim and hold as he
did, under the Duties and Conditions in
that Deed and Charter, and now, is it not
to deny the Conclusion after Concession of
the Premises, for you to deny Believers
and their Children must be signed, when
yet you do acknowledge they are under
<hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, which (as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
requires such signing.</p>
            <p>Ay! but you will say, <q>the <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
were in the Covenant of Grace before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
all as much as we, and yet signing
had no use among <hi>them;</hi> and therefore the
Incumbence and Obligation to sign and to
be signed by vertue of the Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103760:71"/>
founded not on the substance of it, but
on the Administration, cannot be <hi>Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
and everlastingly the same.</q>] And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
it must be acknowledged (that) sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was not in use among the Fathers before
<hi>Abraham,</hi> at least not in the Account of
the Scriptures, the Scriptures being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
silent touching any such thing; but then
the Scripture is as silent touching any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
transaction made with those Fathers,
as it is touching signing by vertue of such a
Covenant; So that, you are too positive
Sir, and without Book, to affirm <hi>them</hi> as
much in Covenant as we, and their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
as Holy by vertue of a Covenant
transaction as ours. But supposing though
not granting a <hi>Covenant</hi> transaction to have
passed between God and the Fathers before
<hi>Abraham,</hi> for Grace, Eternal Life and
Salvation through the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
also, <hi>no</hi> signing by vertue of <hi>that</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
for all that space of time, (which
however, on supposal there was such a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is a hardness to think;) yet, (in
regard that Covenant could not be the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of <hi>Abraham</hi>) though there was no
signing <hi>then,</hi> the <hi>Obligation</hi> to sign and to
be signed by vertue of the Covenant of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> (which as I have shewed doth
indispensibly and necessarily require it,) is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103760:71"/>
as Immutably and <hi>Everlastingly</hi> the <hi>same,</hi> and
in the same Scriptural Sence, <hi>as</hi> the very
<hi>Covenant</hi> it self is <hi>so;</hi> It is <hi>for</hi> Everasting,
though not <hi>from</hi> Everlasting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>à Parte Post,</hi> though not <hi>à Parte ante;
I will Establish my Covenant between me and
thee, and thy Seed after thee, in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
for an Everlasting Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.
Everlasting, not a <hi>parte ante,</hi> as <hi>from</hi> Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
for before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
could not be between God and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
to be a God to him, and to his Seed
after him, and therefore it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
a <hi>parte post,</hi> as a Covenant <hi>to</hi> Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting;
And in <hi>this sence,</hi> the Obligation
and Duty of the Covenant is as capable of
being Everlasting as the Covenant it self;
which was the <hi>third particular</hi> to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
            <p>What I have discoursed already, might
justly supersede any further answer to what
you offer in the following Paragraph, about
the Church Membership of Infants, on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of my saying [that the Church is one,
though the Testaments be not, and that
Children were Members not only of the
Legal, but of the Gospel Church, and that,
for above Four Hundred Years before the
Law; It <hi>being Gospel that was Preached to
Abraham:</hi>] for you say on that occasion,
<q>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:103760:72"/>
that the Gospel was Preached too to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
at the time that he was told that the
Seed of the woman should break the head
of the Serpent.</q> But I have proved that it was
not <hi>told</hi> (as you express it) to <hi>Adam,</hi> but to
the <hi>Serpent,</hi> as being spoken not by way
of Promise to the one, but of denunciation
of a Sentence on the other; nor, in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Scriptures, was the Gospel
Preached to <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp;c. nor
were <hi>they,</hi> in the Account of the Scriptures,
in and under any Covenant of Grace for
Eternal Life and Salvation, much less in and
under the same Covenant, with believing
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and his true Seed; The <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of <hi>Grace,</hi> in the Promise of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah
for Salvation and Eternal Life, being in
the Account of the Scriptures, <hi>first trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted</hi>
with believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> and no
otherwise.</p>
            <p>And here, by the way, observe as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of no small moment, that Almighty
God did <hi>no sooner,</hi> in the Account of the
Scriptures, transact with man in way of
Covenant for Eternal Life and Salvation,
through the Messiah, but he obliged those
in that Covenant, to <hi>keep it</hi> in the sign, and
that from the beginning, <hi>as soon</hi> as he did
institute any <hi>sign</hi> of the Covenant of Grace
for <hi>Parents</hi> (which, in the Account of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103760:72"/>
Scriptures, was as soon as he <hi>Established</hi>
the Covenant,) he did ordain <hi>it</hi> should be
put on the <hi>Children</hi> also, and as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the wearing of <hi>it</hi> by Infants, as by
the Adult. So that from the <hi>very beginning</hi>
of a Covenant transaction for Eternal Life
and Salvation, or in the first making of the
Covenant of Grace according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
(and we are to begin our accounts
where they do,) the Obligation to keep the
sign of the Covenant, or to keep the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in the sign of it, was laid on <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
for Children and Infants, as well as for
himself and others in Age; and that, by
special direction. And now, consider once
again if there be no <hi>connexion</hi> between the
substance of the Covenant and the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(<hi>viz.</hi> to be signed;) Is not the substance
of the Covenant on Gods part, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to <hi>Abraham</hi> to be a God to him, and
to his Seed after him in their Generations?
And hath not God said, <hi>[because] I will be
a God to thee and to thy Seed,</hi> therefore <hi>thou
shalt keep my Covenant, thou and thy Seed?</hi>
So plainly God hath put together the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi>
which is on his part, and the <hi>Duty</hi> and
Obligation that lyes on ours: and when
God hath <hi>joyned</hi> them, and put them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
what man, or men shall dare to
<hi>separate,</hi> and put them asunder?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:103760:73"/>Again, whereas you say, <q>it is one
and the same Church for substance</q>, that
the Old Patriarchs before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
that we the Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Abraham</hi> himself, did and do belong
unto.] I answer, it is one and the same <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Church;</hi> But if we take a Church <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly</hi>
and <hi>Formally,</hi> (as now we are to take
it, when we do speak of <hi>Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:</hi>)
Namely, for a Corporation or visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Society of Holy Men, framed, and
formed under certain special, external and
distinguishing Laws and Institutions, for
Spiritual ends; Then I say, so taking it,
we do not read in Holy Scriptures of any
Church, any formal Church, any more than
of a formal Covenant before <hi>Abraham;</hi> It
being in <hi>his</hi> Family that it pleased God to
lay the first Foundation of the Common-wealth
and Polity of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to form
to himself a special Corporation and Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Men, under visible and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tokens, and this is properly called a
<hi>Church.</hi> For indeed a Church is nothing
but a Company of <hi>called</hi> ones, visibly As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociated;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <hi>ab <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> A Church
is termed so from calling; Now as in the
Account of Holy Scripture, <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his Family were the <hi>First</hi> that God trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
with in way of <hi>Covenant,</hi> for Grace
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103760:73"/>
and Salvation through the Messiah; So in
the same account of Holy Scriptures, the
<hi>first</hi> visible <hi>gathered Church,</hi> was in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Family, <hi>Abraham</hi> being the first that
God in the Holy Scriptures is affirmed to
have <hi>called</hi> out from his own Kindred, and
his <hi>own</hi> Countrey to <hi>another</hi> that he knew
not, which calling of him from his own
Countrey to another that he knew not, was
a <hi>figure</hi> (and by our Apostle is interpreted
to be so <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) of the <hi>true</hi> Spiritual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a Christian, which is a calling out
of, and from the present evil World unto
the Heavenly Country, the New <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
that is above. Not but that before
<hi>Abraham</hi> there were Righteous and good
men, who in their Lives and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
divided from the Communion of the
World; Men that lived justly and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously,
and so were <hi>truly</hi> called out of the
World, but yet they did not (at least the
Scripture doth not Intimate they did) actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
divide and separate from others into
distinct Societies, under any external and
distinguishing Rites before <hi>Abraham;</hi> yes
there were Righteous and good men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Abraham,</hi> divided from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the Piety, Sobriety, and Justice of
their lives, there were Sons of God, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished
by their Piety and Righteousness
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103760:74"/>
from the Sons of men before; <hi>The</hi> Sons of
God <hi>took unto them the</hi> Daughters of Men;
The Sons of good Men Marryed the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of bad: But they were not Actually
divided into distinct Societies and Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
under distinguishing Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
before, and therefore there was
not a visible Organical Church before.</p>
            <p>And if what I now assert be true (as
true it is, for the Holy Scripture no where
intimates not in the least any such Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization,
Incorporation, or Distinguishing
Association of Righteous good men for Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Holy ends before <hi>Abraham;</hi>)
then certainly no reasonable man hath any
cause to admire that before <hi>Abraham</hi> there
should be no <hi>signing;</hi> I mean, no use of
any <hi>Initiating Rite,</hi> and Rite of Matricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or of entring into the Spiritual Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
and Society of the Church; for
no <hi>Matriculation,</hi> no Initiation into any
Corporation or Society is to be conceived
before the Corporation and Society it self
be Constituted and Formed; Nor can any
<hi>Rite</hi> and Ceremony of Matriculation or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiation
be conceived extant before Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
and Initiation it self be so. No
wonder then if no signing before <hi>Abraham,</hi>
seeing no <hi>Formal Church</hi> before <hi>Abraham;</hi>
But yet assoon as it pleased God in Infinite
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103760:74"/>
Wisdom to ordain the Incorporating of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Men into a visible Society for Holy and
Spiritual ends, by making a <hi>Formal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
with them, and so distinguishing and
dividing of them from others, he was then
pleased to assume into that Society, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it, <hi>Children</hi> as well as <hi>Parents, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi>
as well as <hi>Adult</hi> ones; And to ordain,
that the <hi>Sign</hi> of the Covenant, as the Rite
and Ceremony of their Initiation and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
(visibly and externally) into the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of the Righteous, or into the Church,
should be <hi>put</hi> upon <hi>them;</hi> and <hi>this</hi> in deep
Council, the better to <hi>perpetuate</hi> his Church;
So that from the beginning of the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Church, <hi>Infants</hi> were admitted
unto Membership in it; and this is the <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery</hi>
of the Church.</p>
            <p>What you next tell me, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
               <q>that
there are other signes of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Baptism</q>; for instance, as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of old (I believe you meant the Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of old;) so the Lords Supper now, of
which Infants are not by vertue of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
or any Administration of it, taken
to be proper Subjects] This, after what
is said already, is altogether impertinent; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for the <hi>Sign</hi> we dispute about, is that <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating
Sign</hi> only, which is the <hi>Rite of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi>
persons into the visible Organiz'd
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103760:75"/>
Society of the faithful (a Society afterwards
called the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi>) It
being of <hi>this</hi> only that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10.
(from which I argued) can be understood:
and <hi>this</hi> Baptism <hi>is,</hi> as Circumcision <hi>was.</hi>
Nor was the Passover ever <hi>such a Sign,</hi>
nor is the Lords Supper <hi>one</hi> now.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ay! but if Infants are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Initiated into the Church of Christ by
Baptism, then say you, they cannot just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be denyed the Proper means of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
and growth by being admitted
to the Supper also.</q>] But this is a gross
<hi>non sequitur,</hi> For what can be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
than that the Subjects of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Baptism and of that of the Lords
Supper are very different, as different as
those of the Ordinance of Circumcision,
and that of the Pascal Lamb (were;) For
as the Institution of the Ordinance of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was above 400 years before that
of the Passover, so even Jesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
to intimate the same difference, did
institute the Ordinance of Baptism (for his
Disciples Baptized) long before his <hi>Death,</hi>
whereas that of the Holy Supper (being
but a Commemoration of <hi>it</hi>) was not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
but just before his Passion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:103760:75"/>And these considerations lead me to the
<hi>last thing</hi> of any moment which you offer,
a thing on which your whole Party do much
insist, and is, <q>that as Infants are uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of self Examination, of preparation
for the Lords Supper, and of discerning
of the Lords Body, which are <hi>necessary
requisites</hi> to a due participation of that
Holy Ordinance, and therefore are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
it; So they are equally <hi>uncapable</hi> of
<hi>Faith</hi> and of <hi>Repentance</hi> which are the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
conditions</hi> of Admission to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and consequently, on equal reason
are to be refused both the one, and the
other.</q>]</p>
            <p>But here you should have proved <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Repentance</hi> necessary Conditions of <hi>all</hi>
admission to Baptism, or Initiation into the
Gospel Church; I grant <hi>them</hi> to be <hi>so</hi> to
that of the <hi>Adult Heathen;</hi> and so <hi>they</hi>
were before, in some degree, to those of
<hi>them</hi> that would Associate with the Family
of <hi>Abraham;</hi> And so <hi>they</hi> were to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
himself, for <hi>Abraham</hi> himself <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Sign of Circumcision,</hi> or Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
a sign of the Covenant between God
and him, as a <hi>Seal</hi> and full Confirmation
of that <hi>Righteousness by Faith, which he had
while Vncircumcised;</hi> But then, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was admitted for his own Faith, but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103760:76"/>
his Family in, by and under him, as Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by Him; So now the <hi>Adult Heathen</hi>
if they be admitted, it must be in a way
of Faith and Repentance for themselves;
but for their <hi>Families;</hi> Those in them that
are not yet Adult and come to Age, and
in a Capacity of consenting or refusing for
themselves; They must be admitted as
such were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, <hi>viz.</hi> in,
by and under their Parents and Heads, who
Dedicate them.</p>
            <p>But as to this so much is said by so many
others, and so much is hinted also by my
self in my Former Letter, that I do not
think it worth the while to stay longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; Only I find in Mr. <hi>Cradock</hi> in his
Harmony of the Evangelists, a Passage so
full in this particular, and so convincing,
that I should do you some wrong, and my
discourse more, to omit it: First, <hi>saith he</hi>
he gives them a Command and Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to goe and Disciple all Nations, Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
them in the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, beginning at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
[Isa.</hi> 2. 3. and 40. 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.
2.] and declares that, he that believeth and
is Baptized shall be saved, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
not shall be damned. For whereas
before he confined them to Preach only to
<hi>Israel,</hi> now they must Preach to <hi>every
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103760:76"/>
Creature</hi> (namely, that is fit to be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to) that is, to all Nations. And such as
were converted by their Ministry from
Heathenism to Christianity, they were to
Baptize. So that <hi>this</hi> is <hi>not the first Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Baptism, but an <hi>inlarging</hi> of their
former Commission. <hi>Neither</hi> are these
words any <hi>Direction</hi> as <hi>to that other matter
or receiving or admitting Infants, or those
that were not Infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to Baptism: <hi>That,</hi>
we may suppose was sufficiently notified to
them <hi>before,</hi> both by the common <hi>practise</hi>
of their Ancestors in the Jewish Religion,
and by the <hi>vulgar notion</hi> of Baptism, whilst
it was familiarly used among the <hi>Jews,</hi> both
to their <hi>own</hi> and their <hi>Proselite Children,</hi>
and possibly by Christs special <hi>direction</hi> also,
though not mentioned by any of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
who set not <hi>down</hi> all <hi>the words</hi> of the
<hi>First Institution of Baptism,</hi> which long <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded</hi>
this time, as appears plainly from
those words, <hi>Joh. 4. 1, 2. When therefore
the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard
that Jesus made and Baptized more Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
then John, though Jesus himself Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
not but his Disciples.</hi> Certainly, Christ
Instituted Baptism, and gave his Apostles
Commission before they took upon them
to Baptize any, which we find they did in
great Numbers; yet the Gospel does not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103760:77"/>
express the words of this First Institution,
nor the certain time of it, in the course of
Christs Ministry among them; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was sometime before that passage of
story related in that forementioned place,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 4. &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>To that assertion of mine, [<hi>That the
Churches of Christ</hi> universally <hi>have had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of Baptizing Infants, and for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,</hi>
perpetually;] you tell me with a
presumption too big for a greater <hi>Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
(so much more easie it is to tell then to
do,) <q>that you could <hi>easily</hi> give sufficient
<hi>evidence</hi> that the Churches of Christ <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally</hi>
have not had such a custom:</q>]
And I pray you, if it be so <hi>easy,</hi> oblige the
World, and me particularly, by giving <hi>it;</hi>
for still I think that in the time (at least) of
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> the Custom was <hi>Vniversal,</hi> and
that then, it was taken also, to have been
perpetually <hi>so;</hi> and this, by an Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Tradition.</p>
            <p>But that is more <hi>Extravagant</hi> which you
add immediately after, and which may serve
for a <hi>Specimen</hi> of your Ability to perform
the boast you made before, <q>that we do
not find any footsteps of Infants Baptism
in the World till some Hundreds of years
after Christ, not till the conceit grew and
took place of giving Gods Grace by it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103760:77"/>
in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time.</q>] But how learnedly and
knowingly this is spoken may be seen in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
who if you know any thing in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
must be acknowledged to have
been, in time before <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as being the
most Antient of the Latine Fathers, and
born in the year Two Hundred; and yet
<hi>he</hi> in his Book <hi>de Bapt. c.</hi> 18. where for
certain <hi>Reasons</hi> (but I pray you mark, the
Novelty of the practise is not <hi>one</hi> of them,)
he doth <hi>Dehort</hi> the Baptizing of Infants (as
he did also <hi>advise</hi> the deferring of Baptism
to the Adult, and in <hi>both</hi> was singular,) doth
by that very <hi>dehortation,</hi> plainly intimate
the <hi>common practise</hi> of it. <hi>Ita<expan>

but again, what can you say to <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who
was before <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and near the times of
the Apostles, when he tells us <hi>adversus hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
l.</hi> 2. 39. Christus venit omnes per seip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
salvare, omnes Inquam, qui per seipsum
Renascuntur <hi>in Deum;</hi> Infantes <hi>&amp; parvu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los
&amp; pueros;</hi> and by <hi>Renascentia</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
Baptism, as is universally agreed by
all learned in the Fathers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:103760:78"/>And whereas I affirmed [<hi>Antipedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi>
to make the Church of Christ a Church
<hi>unius aetatis;</hi>] you mistook my meaning
when you took it to have been <q>that your
Opinion was but a <hi>Novelty,</hi> (though that
be true too;) and that seeing the Church
of Christ cannot be without a true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and true Baptism, in your sense of
Anabaptism, hath been not much above
an Age or Century, particularly since
the time of <hi>Muncer</hi> (whom <hi>Munster</hi>
calls <hi>Monetarius,</hi> least he should be
thought of Kin to him;) and since <hi>John</hi>
of <hi>Leyden</hi> and <hi>Knipperdolling;</hi> That
therefore before the arising of these <hi>new
lights,</hi> the true Church for many hundred
years, had no existence and being.</q>] For
to do my self right, and you no wrong, I
meant it not in using that expression; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
in it to <hi>L. Florus,</hi> who speaking of
the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Civil Original under <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi>
while yet they had no Women, and
so no hope of Posterity; sayes, <hi>Res erat</hi>
Unius Aetatis, <hi>populus virorum:</hi> and I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by it, that <hi>Antipedobaptisme</hi> by grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
up of Infants, and throwing them out
of the Church, doth indeed destroy the
<hi>Nursery</hi> of the Church, and so, in one Age,
after the Extinction of the old stocks, doth
put it in no small hazard of being utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirped;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103760:78"/>
And now having this occasion, I
dare, in demonstration of the Justice of the
hint, almost appeal unto your own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
if of the Children of Persons of
your perswasion, within the compass of
your own knowledge, that are Adult, and
come to years of Discretion, and were not
Baptized in their Infancy by some Relation
or Friend, <hi>one</hi> almost in <hi>ten</hi> is any wise Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and so entred into any Church (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yours or ours;) for growing up, <hi>dislike</hi>
of your Opinion for the most part doth
keep them from you; And <hi>Shame</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Baptized in Age, (a thing disused, and
as things of that nature commonly are, a
thing that makes talk and gazing,) keeps
them from us; And thus being in no Church,
are visibly in the state of Heathens.</p>
            <p>In your next remark, [when I make the
denyal of Infants Baptism a robbing Parents
of a sensible ground of hope for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in case of the decease of any of them
in Infancy,] you do me manifest <hi>Injustice</hi> to
Insinuate a meaning of <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> a
thing as far from my intentions as words.
But I have sufficiently expressed my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in that particular in the Paragraph
reflected on, to those that are considerate
and candid, and therefore, there remains
no more to be said of it now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:103760:79"/>But as to <hi>what</hi> you offer in the last place,
[concerning the Powerful Motive to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
himself to God, which, I said, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedobaptisme</hi>
depriveth a Child of;] name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<q>that for your part, you are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that nothing can be a greater <hi>hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
to him than Baptism, since he is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
induced to reckon himself already a
good Christian, and in a state of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as having had the Sign of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
already applyed to him in his Infant
State, without looking after the new birth,
and being acquainted with the Mystery of
Spiritual Regeneration, &amp;c.</q>] I profess I
was astonisht to read <hi>it,</hi> both for the <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>
and offence it cannot but administer to
those of a contrary perswasion; as also for
the <hi>ill reflection</hi> which, with too much Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
it may be interpreted to imply upon
the Wisdom and Counsel of God, who,
both before the Law, and under the Law,
was pleased to <hi>Institute the Signing of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
with the Sign of the Covenant; <hi>which</hi>
doubtless, had it been an <hi>impediment</hi> and
hinderance to their Regeneration, and to
Salvation, much more if a most powerful
<hi>one,</hi> he, in his infinite goodness and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as well as wisdom and conduct, would
never have done. And do you indeed think
that the Circumcision of <hi>Children,</hi> instead
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103760:79"/>
of being a furtherance to the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
in <hi>them,</hi> was truly a hinderance
to it, and that that which God intended for
a meanes of Conservation and Perpetuation
of his Church, was really and in effect, a
way to destroy it: Where was the <hi>Wisdom</hi>
of Almighty God, if he knew not what
means were proper towards the Salvation
of his Creatures? And where his <hi>Goodness,</hi>
if he ordained what he knew improper?
It is certain, if Baptism by being put on
Children in their Infancy, in token of their
being given to <hi>God in Covenant,</hi> be in it
self a hinderance to their Regeneration;
Circumcision which was put on Children in
Infancy, and in token of their being given
to <hi>God in Covenant,</hi> could be no further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and consequently was a means of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
most improper to continue the Church,
and so, a means equally unworthy both of
Divine Prudence and Wisdom, and of his
Goodness and Mercy.</p>
            <p>Thus I have finished my defence of the
<hi>Argument</hi> for Infants Baptism from <hi>Gen.
17,</hi> and I think, have answered all is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being opposed against <hi>it,</hi> and yet see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I know not but you may have more, I
now offer, that if you have any thing else
of any Moment to object either against the
Argument it self, or against what is offered
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103760:80"/>
now in the defence of it; If you propose it,
so it be without unnecessary digressions into
common places, and without popular trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
and it be with the Candour and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
and with the modesty and temper
that becomes a lover and seeker of Truth,
I shall answer it chearfully, and therein give
another Instance how much I am.</p>

            <p>YOur Letter of the 29th. of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
in Answer to that I sent you the
21st. of <hi>April,</hi> though put into so
good and safe a hand, came not to
mine before this 14th. of <hi>October,</hi> and then
open. Happily it had occasion to call in on
Friends; and many times, the farthest way
about is nearest home.</p>
            <p>However, though late come, I do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you it is Welcome; for I learn by it
that the Controversie long depending, and
which I fear'd would be Eternal, is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to continue much longer. And that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all the Exclamations of Evident and
most Evident, of Plain and most Plain, of
Scriptural, of Solid, of Substantial and
Cogent which you make on what <hi>You</hi> say;
and of Chimera's, of Repugnant to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of doubtful Consequencies and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103760:81"/>
Uncertainties, of violence to the
Text, of Corruption of Scripture, and of
Addition to it on what I prove. The whole
<hi>now</hi> is to determine on two <hi>Issues,</hi> the one
Relating to the Duty enjoyned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9.
the other to the Subject of that duty; [what
is meant by the Seed, and what by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Covenant:]</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>First Issue</hi> which concerns the
Subject of the Duty (for I will begin with
<hi>that,</hi>) I have abundantly evinced in my last
Letter (and yet you take no notice of it)
that by Seed in the 9th. verse, must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the Spiritual, as well as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Seed, and that, because the same Seed
is meant in the 9th. verse that is in the 7th.
and 8th. verses, the same subject in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
obligation verse the 9th. in all respects,
that is in the promise, verses 7th. and 8th.
and the same subject in the temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
verse the 8th. that is in the Spiritual
verse the 7th: and the subject in the 7th.
(you grant) doth take in all the Seed, the
Spiritual as well as the Carnal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
so it must be in the 8th. and the 9th. I
and in the 10th. also.</p>
            <p>Ay! but say you, the 8th. verse is to
be understood only of the <hi>Carnal Seed,</hi> and
why only (say I) unless the 7th. be also to
be understood, of <hi>that</hi> only doth the Holy
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103760:81"/>
Ghost distinguish? or if he do not, how
dare you? the Subjects are the same in both;
The Connexion carries it for the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects;
and in both the Verses there are the
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame words to express the subject, and
why not then the same subjects meant by
the same words? Especially in regard the
whole is but a continuation of one Speech
of God to <hi>Abraham; I will Establish my
Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed,</hi>
verse the 7th. <hi>And I will give to thee, and
thy Seed,</hi> verse the 8th.</p>
            <p>It it true (as you suggest) in the Letter,
<hi>Canaan</hi> is Promised too, and was Possessed
by the Carnal Seed, but the Litteral is not
the only sence, and therefore the Litteral
are not the only subjects: The Mystical
and Spiritual is the principal sence, and
therefore the Mystical and Spiritual are the
principal subjects: Thus Argueth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>Seed</hi> (saith he) not Seeds: Seed,
and that Seed was <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Letter, for
the promise even of <hi>Canaan</hi> (mark it) was
not made to <hi>Ishmael,</hi> though he were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Seed too, and then alive, and with
him, nor to the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> that
should derive from him by <hi>Ishmael,</hi> but it
was made to <hi>Isaac, in</hi> Isaac <hi>shall thy Seed
be called:</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Letter, in the
Mystery is Christ. <hi>He saith not</hi> Seeds
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103760:82"/>
(saith he) as comprehending <hi>Ishmael</hi> and
<hi>Isaac,</hi> but he saith <hi>Seed,</hi> as speaking but
of one, of <hi>Isaac</hi> only, which <hi>Isaac</hi> in the
Truth is Christ Mystical. Further, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
though <hi>Canaan</hi> only was promised in
the Letter, verse the 8th, the World is
intended in the Mystery, and therefore,
though it be said in the Text, <hi>The Land
in which thou art a Stranger, even all the
Land of Canaan,</hi> yet the Apostle amplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the expression, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. and saith,
<hi>They were Pilgrims and Strangers upon the
Earth,</hi> not in <hi>Canaan</hi> only, but in the
Earth. And if in the Promise which is
made of <hi>Canaan</hi> the World be intended,
well may believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> be intended in
the Seed to whom it is made: For how else
as they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed is <hi>all</hi> theirs, if
all were not some where given to <hi>Abraham</hi>
and to his Seed, and where is all given to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and to his Seed, and so to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> but here? Read I pray advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly,
what our Apostle argues, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
And in your next take also what I argued in
my last, Paragraph by Paragraph, and so
reply to it; Then happily you will see a
consequence and Cogency that yet you do
not, or that you dissemble if you do. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
also that when it is said in verse
the 10th, <hi>This is my Covenant which ye shall
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103760:82"/>
keep between me and ye, and thy Seed after
thee,</hi> there is no such Implication as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
there is in this expression [between
me and thee and thy Seed] of the <hi>subjects</hi>
of the Duty [of keeping that Covenant,]
but of the <hi>Parties</hi> in the Covenant; which
(as I told you formerly) are three, and
(mark it) God is one of them: <hi>Between
me,</hi> namely, God on the one part, and <hi>ye,</hi>
thou <hi>Abraham</hi> and thy natural Family here
present on the other part, <hi>and thy Seed,
Isaac</hi> in the Letter in whom the Seed was
called, and Christ (typified in <hi>Isaac,</hi> and in
him the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Children of the
Promise) in the mystery on the third part.
It is unadvised to inferr that the <hi>Seed</hi> here
is obliged to keep the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
by vertue of that expression, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that are bound to keep it are <hi>ye,</hi> ye
<hi>shall keep</hi> this my <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the [Ye]
are distinguished from the <hi>Seed, [between
me and ye, and thy Seed:]</hi> you may as well
say, <hi>all</hi> the parties are obliged to keep it,
and God is one of them, as that, by force
of that expression, <hi>any</hi> one is: those that
are to keep it are represented under the
term [ye;] and they were to keep it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and themselves, and the Seed,
as a sign of the Tripartite,] Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. And to be clear, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103760:83"/>
the same Seed in the 7th. 8th. 9th.
and 10th. verses; <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Letter,
Christ Mystical in the Spirit and Mystery.
This for the first Issue.</p>
            <p>As for the other which relates to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
what can almost be plainer, than that
by keeping of the Covenant in the 9th.
verse, is meant keeping of it in the sign, or
keeping the sign of the Covenant, for it is,
<hi>Thou shalt keep my Covenant, therefore thou
and thy Seed</hi> in the 9th verse, and then
immediately is added in the 10th. in one
continued Speech, <hi>This is my Covenant
which ye shall keep,</hi> &amp;c. So that the sence
and meaning of the Phrase [of keeping the
Covenant] in either verse, is clearly the
meaning of it in both; And therefore to
keep the Covenant in the 9th. verse, is to
keep the sign of the Covenant, seeing to
keep the Covenant in the 10th. is to keep it
so, [in the sign.]</p>
            <p>That to keep the Covernant in the 10th.
verse is to keep it in the sign is manifest,
seeing their being Circumcised could not be
a keeping of the Covenant (as it is plainly
intimated in verse the 10th. to be) but so,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> as it was the observation of the sign
of the Covenant, and thus [in the sign]
the Covenant of God was kept in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
as the Passover is said to be kept
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103760:83"/>
when the Lamb was eaten in Memory of
it; So Scriptural a way of speaking this is.
I say, as the Feast of the Paschal Lamb was
not the Passover it self, but a sign only of
the passing over, and yet the Passover is said
to have been kept, when that Feast was
kept (in sign of it,) as by comparing <hi>Num.</hi>
9. 2. &amp;c. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 3, 4, 12, 13.
&amp;c. manifestly appears. So likewise Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
though it were not in it self the
very Covenant of God, but only the sign
of that Covenant; <hi>[Abraham received the</hi>
sign <hi>of Circumcision, Rom.</hi> 4. and in <hi>Gen.
17. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. It shall be a</hi> token <hi>of the Covenant
between me and you.]</hi> Yet the Covenant of
God (according to the way of Scriptural
Expression) might well be said to be kept,
when Circumcision the sign of it, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
The Covenant in Scripture Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is said to be kept, when the sign of
it is kept, <hi>Thou shalt keep my Covenant, is,</hi>
thou shalt keep the sign of my Covenant.
<hi>This is my Covenant which ye shall keep,</hi> is,
this is the sign of my Covenant which ye
shall keep. And if keeping Circumcision
then were keeping of the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Circumcision was the then sign of it;
then keeping Baptism, now is keeping the
Covenant, because Baptism is now the sign
of it. To keep the Covenant <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here, is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103760:84"/>
as I have proved to keep the sign.</p>
            <p>And now consider seriously, how plain
and easie a sence this is I have of the words,
<hi>I will Establish my Covenant between me and
thee, and thy Seed after thee, between me</hi>
the Lord, <hi>and thee</hi> Abraham, and thy Seed
<hi>Isaac</hi> in the Letter and Spirit, <hi>to be a God
to thee</hi> Abraham, <hi>and to thy Seed after thee,
Isaac</hi> in the Letter and Spirit <hi>And I will
give to thee</hi> Abraham, <hi>and to thy Seed Isaac</hi>
in the Letter and Spirit, <hi>all the Land in
which thou art a Stranger.</hi> Even the <hi>Land
of Canaan</hi> in the Letter to <hi>Isaac,</hi> in the
Letter, and the World the whole VVorld
in the Spirit and Mystery, to <hi>Isaac</hi> in the
Mystery, and therefore thou <hi>Abraham</hi> and
thy Seed [<hi>Isaac</hi> in the Letter and Spirit]
shall keep [the sign of] my Covenant.
<hi>(But) this is [the sign of] my Covenant which
ye</hi> which are now here, thou <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Ishmael</hi> thy Son according to the Flesh, and
the rest of thy Houshold here which stand
for all the Seed according to the Flesh as so,
<hi>This is</hi> [the sign of] <hi>my Covenant which ye,</hi>
for your part, <hi>shall keep</hi> [as a sign of the
Covenant I have made <hi>between me and ye,
and thy Seed</hi> Isaac the Seed of the Promise,
and not of the Flesh] <hi>every Man-child a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you</hi> [ye the Natural Family and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Seed] <hi>shall be Circumcised.</hi> Among
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103760:84"/>
you, he doth not say among the Seed; The
Seed is to keep the Covenant in a sign verse
the 9th. but the Natural Family only are to
keep it in <hi>this</hi> sign, in Circumcision; <hi>Thou
shalt keep my Covenant therefore</hi> [in the sign
of it] <hi>thou and thy Seed;</hi> (But) <hi>this is my
Covenant which ye shall keep, &amp;c.</hi> Every
Man-child shall be Circumcised.</p>
            <p>Ay, say you, but in the sign of it is your
Addition only. Not so say I, it is but my
Explication according to the Scripture, Ay,
but when God did tell <hi>Abraham, Thou shalt
keep my Covenant therefore</hi> thou <hi>and thy Seed,</hi>
had no more (say you) been added, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
could never have understood that God
intended hereby, this Covenant was to be
observed in any external sign; true, say I,
had not God explained his meaning, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
might well have doubted of it; but
why doubt you? Since more is added, and
in what is added, God explains himself,
and shews that, by keeping the Covenant,
he meant keeping the sign of it. Ay, but
a sign is a common separable accident to a
Covenant (in general,) well, but it is not
so to this (in special;) Other Covenants
have been (you say) without a sign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
to be sure, in this a sign is made necessary;
For to keep the Covenant is to keep the
sign. Ay, say you, but let go this 7th.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103760:85"/>
of <hi>Genesis</hi> which is no more to purpose then
the first, and then I will answer what else
you have to say. Yes, very likely, as you
have what is already said, and if I will
throw away my weapons you will fight me.
In fine, what (say you) so important an
ordinance to depend on consequence from
an Old Testament Text! Yes (say I) and
on the consequence of this Old Testament
Text depends all the New Testament Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our Inheritance and Heirship; See
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>And now, Dear Sir, is there not a word,
not a syllable (as you express it) in the 17th.
of <hi>Genesis,</hi> that the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
are to keep the Covenant in the sign of
it? Have not I proved the Seed here is <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
in the Spirit Principally? doth not God
distinguish between ye and thy Seed? is not
Circumcision enjoyned only on the natural
Carnal Family of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the term <hi>ye</hi>
as it is distinguished from the Seed? is not
the same the subject in the Obligation in the
9th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verse, that is in the Promise Spiritual
in the 7th. and temporal in the 8th. you
cannot deny it, if you read the Text. If
you design me any satisfaction, it must not
be by blending and confounding things that
differ, nor by common placing and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off in generals, but you must come up
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103760:85"/>
close to the matter, and shew why the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in the general Obligation verse the 9th.
is, in all respects the same with that in the
Promise, both the Temporal and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
but the subjects of the Obligation to
Circumcision in particular, which is in the
10th. is altered. It is not there thou and
thy Seed as all along before, but <hi>[ye]</hi> and
<hi>[ye]</hi> is in the Letter <hi>Abraham,</hi> and those
then with him there: But <hi>Isaac</hi> was not
there, he was the Promised Seed. Again,
why doth God distinguish <hi>[ye]</hi> from the
Seed; <hi>between me and ye, and thy Seed.</hi>
In fine, why all along in the 10th. and 11th.
verses, both in the imposition of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and in the intimation of the end and
use of it, the Holy Ghost doth use a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictive
term, and never mentions the Seed
but <hi>ye, ye shall keep</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>it shall be a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
between me and ye;</hi> He saith not thy
Seed shall keep it <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor that it shall be
a token to the Seed; He saith thy Seed shall
keep the Covenant in a sign, but doth not
say that they shall keep the Covenant in this
sign; They must keep a sign but not this
sign. Clear up these questions and you do
something, and without it all is nothing.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly stated the issues on
which the thing in Controversie between us
now depends, and I have answered your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103760:86"/>
and am bold to say again that I
have done it with the candour and fairness
that becomes a seeker of truth. I mince
not what you say; I raise no dust to hide
your strength, or blind the eyes of a Party.
I do not frighten you with the threatnings
on diminutions of Scripture; as you do me
with those on Additions; such common
placing here is out of place, and is fooling.
I love not Tragical Declamations instead of
Argumentation. Nor yet am I by noise and
clamour and harangues of words which
take with the people, but not with the wise,
to be diverted from pursuing advantages.
I know where I pinch you; and yet I hate
to cry <hi>Victoria</hi> while the field is disputing.
I am a lover of plainness, as well as a seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of all truth, and therefore use as little
Artifice in arguing, as I do in Professing
my self,</p>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN your <hi>former</hi> Letter of <hi>September</hi> the
29th. you told me,<q> that the words
in the 17th. of <hi>Genesis</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9th. [<hi>Thou
shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou
and thy Seed,</hi> &amp;c.] do neither express
nor give any the least intimation of any
sign at all that God intended should be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
unto the Covenant, &amp;c. for there
God commands <hi>Abraham</hi> to keep the
Covenant in General Terms only, and
doth not say thou shalt keep my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in the <hi>sign</hi> of it, <hi>that</hi> being (say
you) my Addition only, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> But in <hi>this</hi>
of <hi>December</hi> the 15th. which I Received
the 20th. you tell me, that as far as you
can discern, God speaks but of <hi>one</hi> sign in
<hi>both</hi> verses, <hi>[viz. 9. 10]</hi> Now, how I
pray you can he speak of <hi>one</hi> sign in <hi>both</hi>
verses, if (as you copiously affirmed) he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103760:87"/>
speaks nothing in the least of any sign at all
in <hi>one</hi> of them? who is it now (to use your
own Expressions) that is Dazled? that
sees or saw one for two, and two for one?
and yet, all you say is Demonstration, 'tis
Solid, Scriptural, Substantial, and all I say
is Chymera's, Contradictions, unproved
Dictates, &amp;c. Really Dear Sir, some grains
of <hi>Modesty</hi> would do no hurt; <hi>It</hi> would at
least serve to make your <hi>Alterations</hi> more
excusable.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>former,</hi> is not the only <hi>Point</hi>
(though mind, it be one of the two Issues
on which the whole between us must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,)
in which you are so <hi>slippery;</hi> you
are as much <hi>so</hi> in another, and <hi>that</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Issue; for in your former Letters, all
a long, you understand by the <hi>Spiritual Seed</hi>
as I do, and as you ought, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Christ
and Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> (to whom happily,
you add Believing <hi>Jews,</hi>) or Christ Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
represented in <hi>Isaac,</hi> and indeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a softer place in ones head than I am
willing to believe you have, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
seriously, to take it otherwise; for
'tis <hi>[in Isaac thy Seed shall be called;]</hi> not
[thy Seed shall be called <hi>Isaac.</hi>] And yet,
in your Letter <hi>now</hi> you take the Spiritual
Seed for <hi>Isaac's Person;</hi> A sence of the
Spiritual Seed against sence; For it is <hi>Isaac</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:103760:87"/>
in the Spirit only that is the Spiritual Seed,
and <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Spirit, is Christ Mystical;
For so the Apostle <hi>[and to thy Seed which
is Christ.]</hi> It is true, <hi>Isaac</hi> was a Mystical
Person as he was a Type and Figure; but
if you mean but <hi>that</hi> by his being the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Seed, [that he was the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and was a Mystical Person,] then <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
was no more the Spiritual Seed then
<hi>Ishmael; Ishmael</hi> being as much the Seed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and as much a Mystical and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical
person as <hi>Isaac; Ishmael</hi> a Type and
Figure of the Legal Carnal Seed, as <hi>Isaac</hi>
of the Believing Evangelical Seed; The
former representing the <hi>Jews,</hi> the latter
Christ and Believing <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Only, as
<hi>Ishmael</hi> to be a Type and Figure of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Legal</hi> Seed, was to be born <hi>after the
Flesh,</hi> according to the Rule and Law of
Generation in Nature; So <hi>Isaac</hi> to be a
Type and Figure of the Spiritual <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi>
Seed [who were to be <hi>born not of bloods,
nor of the will of the Flesh, nor of the will of
Man, but of God</hi>] was to be born after
<hi>the Spirit, (viz.)</hi> by the power of God
according to and in performance of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>
(made) to <hi>Abraham.</hi> And to be <hi>born
after the Spirit,</hi> with respect to <hi>Isaac,</hi> is
not (as happily, you may conceive it) to
be Regenerated and new born Spiritually,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103760:88"/>
but to be born as to his natural Person not as
<hi>Ishmael</hi> was, in the ordinary course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by meer Carnal Coition; but by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi>
in a supernatural way, above the
Rules and Lawes and Powers of Nature,
by Almighty Power Assisting; even when
it had ceased (as the Scripture tells us) to
be with <hi>Sarah</hi> after the manner of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and when <hi>Abraham</hi> Himself also was
old. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 23, 29. what is to be by
<hi>Promise</hi> in the one verse, is to be <hi>born after
the Spirit</hi> in the other. To start then a
sence of the Spiritual Seed which was not
thought of before, and which were not to
the Purpose if a good one, is <hi>doubling;</hi>
and a Hare is used to <hi>double,</hi> when near run
down.</p>
            <p>Had I been engaged in this controversie
with a man <hi>unprejudiced,</hi> and not with one
who, in adherence to an opinion long ago
Conceived and Riveted, is obliged to do
<hi>all</hi> things to maintain it, with one suscepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Light, and not with one that <hi>wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,</hi>
and winds, and turns, and all to avoid
it; with one that admits of plain sence,
and not with one that will not see, that
<hi>thrice one</hi> makes <hi>three;</hi> or, that a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>thy Seed</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thee, is a Covenant between <hi>three</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
I say, had I had the happiness of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103760:88"/>
and trying of it with a Person indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
and not the misfortune of being
ingaged with one so hugely prepossessed,
and one not very consistent to Himself, or
to his Principles, the business long ago had
been ended; but who can draw the Picture
of <hi>Proteus,</hi> or catch a Capering <hi>Will with</hi>
the Wisp? <hi>[Ignis fatuus]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to your groundless, severe, Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
<hi>Reflections</hi> (the which you call <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs</hi>
drest up (by all means!) in studyed,
<hi>clean, mild, decent, and Christian Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>)
I say once for all, that it were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
for me, if I durst allow my self the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
you take in that kind, and that it were
not both undecent and unchristian to sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<hi>my</hi> Pen too: But I am resolved not to
gratifie your <hi>design</hi> by any such intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
I can better bear then deserve your
Reprehensions, and I have (I believe) too
great <hi>Advantage</hi> in the <hi>cause,</hi> and in my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
to marr <hi>it</hi> by so <hi>bad</hi> Example. I
alwayes thought it very improper in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
and Controversies instead of Arguing,
to be (as you Phrase it,) Cutting. He is
rather a Butcher then a good Chyrurgion,
that delights in cutting, and tearing, and
slashing, when there is no need of it. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
softer words and harder Arguments
would more <hi>become</hi> you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:103760:89"/>But among all your Groundless Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
none is more absurd, nor more
unhandsome then the <hi>outcry,</hi> the Tragical
Outcry which you raise upon a <hi>Mistake</hi> of
the Transcriber, and <hi>that</hi> too but in a word,
but in a letter, and without marring the
Sence; <hi>[in Isaac shall the Seed be called]</hi>
viz. [the Seed] instead of [thy Seed] for
so in truth, it was in the <hi>Exemplar,</hi> but
likely, on a hasty cursory review of the
<hi>Transcript</hi> not alter'd, because it stood with
the sence. But though it were not in the
First Exemplar [the Seed] but [thy Seed,]
and [the] indeed were only a mistake of
him that Copyed <hi>it;</hi> yet had you repeated
the whole <hi>Period</hi> in which it was inserted,
(but <hi>that</hi> must be <hi>cleanly, meekly, decently,</hi>
Dissembled for the cause, and that you
might have matter to work on;) it would
appear that in that place, and in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which the passage was brought in;
[the] was not improper; no, no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
then [thy.] For thus it stands in the
Letter was sent—<q>The Promise even
of <hi>Canaan</hi> (mark it) was not made to
<hi>Ishmael,</hi> though he were <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed
too, and then alive, and with him; nor
to <hi>the Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> that should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from him by <hi>Ishmael,</hi> but it was made
to <hi>Isaac, for in Isaac shall</hi> the Seed <hi>be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103760:89"/>
called,</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Letter, in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
is Christ.</q>] And who but <hi>Argus,</hi> if
even <hi>He</hi> with all his Hundred Eyes can <hi>spy</hi>
a fault here? I, but if it cannot be <hi>spy'd,</hi>
(happily) it may be felt, for (say you) <hi>it is
a</hi> Palpable <hi>abuse of Scripture in misrendring
it.</hi>] And is it so? but what then, if both
[the] and [thy] too had been omitted,
and [His] put in? Sure the sence had still
been good, and the Argument good still,
and the Scripture not abused. For Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Application of Scripture, even by
Christ Himself, and by his Apostles, who
I believe, would not abuse it by misren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
is not (as might be manifested in a
hundred Instances) alwayes (as you would
have it) to a syllable, and in termes; but
to the sence, and present purpose: and sure
I am, that the Seed [of <hi>Abraham</hi>] should
be called in <hi>Isaac,</hi> is to my purpose, and is
the sence of <hi>Genesis</hi> 21. 12. * as much as
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 30. is to the sence of <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 10.
and to the Apostles Purpose. Thus over
subtile you be; without Discretion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Judgment, and without Candour, and
this 'tis to be Learned in <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and to
have subtle <hi>John Duns</hi> (Scotus) for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
But to our business.</p>
            <p>Whereas I had said I have abundantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that by Seed in the 9th. verse, must
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103760:90"/>
be understood the Spiritual as well as the
Carnal Seed; you reply, that <hi>that may be
easily evinced which was never controverted:</hi>]
As if it had not been in the Controversie all
along, and been the <hi>main</hi> of it, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be so in your former Letter [whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Spiritual Seed were meant in the
7. 8. 9. and 10th. verses as well as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?]
and is not <hi>this</hi> the first Issue, in which
you have joyned? Well, but whatever it
was before, my business <hi>now,</hi> as you assign
it, is to prove (in your terms) that <hi>Isaac
quatenus</hi> Spiritual Seed, or (which I think
you mean, or mean nothing to purpose)
that <hi>Isaac as</hi> he represented the Spiritual
Seed or Christ Mystical, is meant in verse
the 9th. And this I think I have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
evinced already, and that (after your
<hi>Concession</hi>) it needeth no more Eviction; It
being indeed a <hi>Figure</hi> of speaking, called
in <hi>English</hi> a <hi>Bull,</hi> to say the Spiritual Seed
is meant as well as the Carnal (as you say,
and say it was never controverted,) and yet,
that the Spiritual Seed <hi>as</hi> Spiritual is not
meant, for if the Spiritual Seed, be not
meant <hi>as</hi> Spiritual, then the Carnal Seed
<hi>only,</hi> and not the Spiritual <hi>as well</hi> as the
Carnal is meant. This should suffice by
way of Rejoynder; But, because (as you
affirm) this is a Foundation stone (such as it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103760:90"/>
is) in that structure I have raised, and you
are so over confident (for nature will have
its course,) that I cannot prove by Scripture,
that the Spiritual Seed <hi>as</hi> Spiritual, is meant
in the 9th. verse; <hi>besides,</hi> what I have
done already in my former Letters, which
stands altogether on this foot, and which
you have not in the least reply'd to; and
<hi>besides,</hi> that I cannot conceive if the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Seed be meant at all (as you grant it is)
but that it must be meant <hi>as</hi> Spiritual (for
it is <hi>you</hi> must tell me, <hi>how</hi> else, it can be
meant;) I say, besides all this, you shall
have a Text, a plain Text for it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I Cite the Text, I will assume as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and agreed between us, to make it
come home, what you have <hi>asserted</hi> very
fully in a <hi>former</hi> Letter, and also I have
proved; <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the <hi>same</hi> subject in all
respects is meant in the 9th. verse, <hi>that</hi> is in
the 8th.; And taking this for granted, I
affirm that the Apostle sayes all as much as
you would have me to prove, when <hi>Rom.</hi>
4. 13, 16, 17. He argues in these terms,
<hi>For the Promise that he (viz.</hi> Abraham)
<hi>should be the heir of the</hi> World, <hi>was not to</hi>
Abraham, <hi>or to his Seed by the Law, but
through the Righteousness of Faith; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is of Faith, that it might be by grace,
to the end that the</hi> Promise <hi>might be sure to</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:103760:91"/>
All the Seed; <hi>not to</hi> that <hi>only which is of
the Law, but to that also which is of the faith
of</hi> Abraham, [clearly implying, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
would not have been sure to <hi>all</hi> the
Seed, if it had not been <hi>so</hi> to <hi>both</hi> Seeds.]
<hi>who is the Father of</hi> Us all. But to apply
the Text. Either the <hi>Promise</hi> made to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
(for in <hi>Isaac</hi> Abrahams <hi>Seed</hi> is called,)
was made to him, and so the <hi>Obligation</hi> lay
upon him <hi>quatenus, as</hi> he represented the
Seed of the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Abraham;</hi> or <hi>it</hi> was
made to him, and so the <hi>Obligation</hi> lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him <hi>as</hi> not representing <hi>that</hi> Seed: If
you say the <hi>Promise</hi> was made to him, and
so the <hi>Obligation</hi> lay upon him <hi>quatenus,</hi> as
he represented the Seed of the Faith of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> then it was made to him, and
the <hi>Obligation</hi> lay upon him <hi>quatenus, as</hi> he
represented the <hi>Spiritual Seed;</hi> for the seed
of the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Spiritual
Seed; but if you say the Promise was made
to <hi>Isaac,</hi> and so the Obligation lay upon
him <hi>as</hi> in his own Person only, or only <hi>as</hi>
the Legal either mere Carnal or believing
seed descended from him, then the Promise
is not sure to <hi>all</hi> the seed, not to the <hi>Seed
of the Faith</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> under the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
because this seed then, is not Entituled to
it <hi>as</hi> seed, for it is in <hi>Isaac</hi> that <hi>Abrahams</hi>
seed is called, according to <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103760:91"/>
               <hi>so</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> (who makes good their Title
<hi>as Abrahams</hi> seed, and consequently as
they were in <hi>Isaac,</hi>) was really out of the
right, if <hi>you</hi> be in it.</p>
            <p>But I have mentioned a <hi>Concession</hi> of
yours in a <hi>Former Letter,</hi> and make use of
it; least therefore you either should forget
it, or should by some Evasion which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think of <hi>Elevate</hi> the force of it, and so
Create me new trouble hereafter, I will
cite the passage now, but with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution,
that I do not say you understand
<hi>precisely</hi> the same persons as I do, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in the 8th. and 9th. and 10th. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but I say you grant <hi>there,</hi> and there
make much of it, that the <hi>same</hi> persons or
subjects (be they what they will,) are to
be understood as meant in the 9th. and 10th,
verses, which are so in the 8th. For say
you [<q>God having <hi>promised</hi> in the 8th.
verse to give unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his
<hi>Seed</hi> after him the Land wherein he was
then a stranger, even all the Land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> for an Everlasting Possession, and
to be their God. In the very next verse
he is pleased to proceed to declare the
<hi>Incumbence</hi> now to be fastened on <hi>them</hi>
upon the <hi>forementioned account,</hi> &amp;c.</q>] So
that <hi>you</hi> grant, the <hi>same</hi> persons are under
the <hi>Incumbence</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103760:92"/>
the <hi>Promise,</hi> and are so in the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as being in the Obligation upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their being in the Promise, and
the <hi>Apostle</hi> is plain, that the <hi>Promise</hi> is to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and to <hi>all</hi> his Seed, the Seed
which is of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the
believing <hi>Gentile,</hi> as well as the Seed which
is of the Law, or the Natural <hi>Jew;</hi> And
I should think the Apostles Authority as
good as any. And now, 'tis a proper time
to answer your <hi>question,</hi> and to tell what
Authors I follow, why, you see, they are
Scriptural ones, such as <hi>Paul</hi> &amp;c. the same
Authors the first Reformers <hi>followed,</hi> and
the same your Predecessors <hi>pretended</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>This is the proof I have that <hi>Isaac</hi> in the
Spirit, or <hi>Isaac as</hi> he Represented Christ
Mystical, and <hi>so</hi> the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
meant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9. Against which, you
offer me again <hi>what</hi> in effect, I have baffled
over and over. But because it may afford
me a <hi>rise</hi> of more express declaring what
I have said formerly, and also of adding
something which I had not such occasion to
produce before, I shall consider it again.</p>
            <p>You say then, <q>that <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Spirit,
or the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the Seed in the 9th. verse,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103760:92"/>
because the Seed there mentioned, is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly</hi>
commanded in the 10th. to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised.</q>]
Which (say I) is, In effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to say it is so, because it is so. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>force</hi> of which Reply, as well as
of your Reason, I must have leave to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the <hi>State</hi> of Matters, as at present
they do stand between us.</p>
            <p>The 9th. verse is the parting point. You
argue that the Seed in the 9th. verse, [<hi>Thou
shalt keep my Covenant therefore Thou and
thy Seed</hi>] cannot be understood of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Seed, [believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi>] because
that Seed which is in the 9th. verse, is (say
you) expresly commanded in the 10th. to
be <hi>Circumcised;</hi> and that <hi>that</hi> is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>keeping the Covenant</hi> in verse the 9th.
I on the contrary, argue that the <hi>Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in the 9th. verse, cannot be understood
<hi>Determinately,</hi> and particularly of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
because the subject of <hi>it</hi> is the same
Seed to whom the Promise is made; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>All</hi> the Seed, and Circumcision was
not competent to <hi>all;</hi> and that therefore
<hi>[ye.]</hi> in the 10th. verse, on which the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to be Circumcised is laid, cannot
possibly include the <hi>Seed</hi> as in the 9th. verse,
this is the true <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For you therefore to take for granted
that the Seed mentioned in the 9th. verse,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103760:93"/>
is included in <hi>[ye]</hi> in the 10th. is as thing so
mean and pitiful, that in <hi>English,</hi> it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Begging,</hi> Begging the question, for this
is one of the Points <hi>in question</hi> between us:
But to affirm that the Seed in the 9th. verse,
is expresly commanded in the 10th. to be
Circumcised, is <hi>worse,</hi> for in express terms,
it is not [this is the Covenant which thou
and thy <hi>Seed</hi> shall keep] but [this is the
Covenant which <hi>ye</hi> shall keep,] and what
is meant by [ye] whether <hi>Abraham</hi> and the
<hi>Seed</hi> mentioned before in verse the 9th. or
only He and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and the other persons
then present at the Institution of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which God should speak to, is the
question.</p>
            <p>I do confess, the <hi>Grammar</hi> of the Text
would have carried it well enough for your
sence, and it would have run smoothly,
<hi>[Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou
and thy Seed; This is the Covenant which
ye shall keep]</hi> if it had not pleased God to
add <hi>[between</hi> me <hi>and</hi> you, <hi>and</hi> thy Seed <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thee:]</hi> But yet even <hi>then</hi> I could not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
have understood how <hi>Any</hi> of the Seed
could be excused from Circumcision. But
<hi>that</hi> then, had been the only difficulty; but
<hi>now</hi> there is <hi>another,</hi> and no small one; for
God himself <hi>Distinguishing</hi> in the 10th.
verse, between <hi>you</hi> and thy <hi>Seed</hi> after thee,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103760:93"/>
               <hi>[This is the Covenant which</hi> you <hi>shall keep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi>
me <hi>and</hi> you, <hi>and thy</hi> Seed <hi>after</hi> thee;]
and <hi>thy Seed after thee</hi> in the 10th. verse,
being in all respects the same expression,
without any the least alteration, with that
in the 9th, and that also in one continued
Speech, and consequently signifying the
same <hi>subjects</hi> in all respects, what is plainer
then that this <hi>distinction</hi> must be a <hi>Key</hi> to
the whole Text, and that to open the Text
in any wayes without <hi>this,</hi> will not be to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
but force it.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Distinction</hi> indeed is that which
pinches and amazes you, and makes you
so confused that you scarce know what you
say, for in <hi>one</hi> place you say it resolutely,
<q>
                  <hi>that there is no such Distinction but of my
making;</hi>
               </q> but in <hi>another,</hi> with greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
you say, <q>
                  <hi>that as appears to you, God
doth not distinguish the</hi> [ye] <hi>from the Seed
in the beginning of the 10th. verse, except
as one was present, the other</hi> Future.</q>] And
what is all this? but that he doth distinguish
and that he doth not, and that he doth not
distinguish except as he doth distinguish,
and that as much as can <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> distinguished,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> as one from many, and present per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from future, ah! Dear Sir you seem a
little <hi>unsettled;</hi> and therefore it is time to
give over.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:103760:94"/>But happily, I go too fast, and you will
tell me that as you said, that no such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
is but of my making, so you gave
a reason for saying it, <hi>(viz)</hi> That <hi>the
termes of every distinction must be opposite,
else it is no distinction;</hi>] And there is <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>
for me: And sweet Sir for this I thank
you [that there is no distinction but where
opposition,] It is new, a new <hi>Light</hi> in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick;
Former Logicians (poor dark men,
they) never saw it, one of them, and he
no small one neither, <hi>Dully</hi> tells us, that
Diversity is either Distinction or Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and not one of them (so blind they
be) but would tell, that Disparates are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
and are not opposites; And indeed
Dear Sir your <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Tongue,</hi> and
<hi>Hand,</hi> are things distinct, but (I hope) not
<hi>Opposites;</hi> Either other Logicians (all of
them) are out of their Element; or you,
yet, Good Sir not come into it.</p>
            <p>Well, but however you express it, your
meaning may be good, <hi>ye, and thy Seed</hi>
may be conjoyned in one party in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
as you say they are, though by
the way, to be conjoyned, <hi>they,</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
must be distinct. But what you add,
is neither good nor true; (viz.) <q>
                  <hi>That
the Seed which I would make a Member
of the Distinction, is a self Created term]</hi>
               </q>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:103760:94"/>
so you say, but mean (I think) a Creature
of mine. But I assure you 'tis not so; I
am no Creator; I added not these termes
<hi>[between me and you, and thy Seed;]</hi> they
are the Holy Spirits, and not mine, and
seem even at first sight, to imply a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>parties,</hi> as well as of <hi>persons,</hi> and to
sound as if the Covenant were <hi>Tripartite,</hi>
but yet, as I love not skirmishing for words
only, call them two parties, or three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or four parties if you will, provided
you distinguish between God and <hi>you,</hi> and
<hi>thy Seed,</hi> and do not make <hi>you</hi> and <hi>thy Seed</hi>
all one <hi>thing,</hi> as well as all one <hi>party;</hi> I
assure you it shall break no squares.</p>
            <p>But by occasion of your directing me
unto the second and fourth verses of the
17th. of <hi>Gen.</hi> to prove the Covenant <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite;</hi>
give me leave to observe to you,
(and in the Observation to imply an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,)
that <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he is the subject
in the Promises in the whole transaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and him, doth in diverse places,
undergo a diverse consideration, he is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
two waves; First, he is considered
<hi>singly</hi> by himself, and in his own Person,
and so he is transacted with, and Promises
are made to him, verses 2. 4, 5, 6. <hi>[I will
make my Covenant between me and</hi> thee, <hi>my
Covenant is with</hi> thee; <hi>Thy Name shall be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103760:95"/>
no more Abram, but Abraham, I will make</hi>
thee <hi>many Nations.]</hi> In all these a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
singly, and in his own Person; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any mention of his Seed, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of them. But then secondly, he
is considered <hi>jointly,</hi> as concerned with his
Seed, and so, he is transacted with, and
promises are made and ratified to him in
the 7th. and 8th. verses; <hi>[and I will Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
my Covenant between me and thee, and</hi>
thy Seed <hi>after thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I will give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, and to thy</hi> Seed <hi>after thee, the Land
in which thou art a Stranger]</hi> Now the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
as made with <hi>Abraham</hi> singly, is
<hi>Bipartite;</hi> but as made with <hi>Abraham as</hi>
he is joyned with his Seed, it is <hi>Tripartite;</hi>
for there a <hi>new party,</hi> or (which is as much
as I said I would contend for, or be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to mean) a new, another Person is
taken in. Again, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
a double consideration in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
or Promise, and was transacted with
both <hi>singly</hi> in his own Person, and also <hi>joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
with his Seed; So answerably, in the
general Obligation verse the 9th, he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
and in terms made the subject of it,
both <hi>singly</hi> by himself, and also as <hi>joyned</hi>
with the Seed; <hi>[Thou shalt keep my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
therefore,]</hi> there he is singly; <hi>[Thou
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103760:95"/>
and</hi> thy Seed <hi>after thee in their Generations,]</hi>
there he is joyned: So exact it pleases God
to be, even in termes, in adjusting of the
subjects in the <hi>Promise</hi> and <hi>Obligation,</hi> and
in making of them Answering; All to
shew, that those that are included in the
<hi>one,</hi> are equally implyed in the <hi>other,</hi> and
that by the same account and consideration,
by which any lay their claim to the <hi>former,</hi>
by the very same consideration, and on the
same account they come under the tyes of
the <hi>Latter.</hi> On the whole, it is not so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
if duly weighed, to say (which yet I
do not peremptorily say) that in that part
of the Covenant in which <hi>Abraham</hi> is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Seed, <hi>he</hi> should <hi>stand</hi> for his
<hi>natural posterity,</hi> as there the Seed <hi>doth</hi> for
<hi>Christ</hi> Mystical: And so much the Text
you Cite, namely, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 9, 11, 12. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> that the Parents represent and
stand for their Children; though in other
Respects, that Text is no wayes Parallel to
this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. nor serves your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
For there it is <hi>[between me and you,
and your Seed]</hi> but here <hi>[between me and</hi>
you, <hi>and</hi> thy <hi>Seed, not your Seed,</hi>] and
you have told me, that on every point of
the Law, Mountains of sence do hang.</p>
            <p>I have proved the Distinction [between
God and you, and thy Seed] to be Real:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103760:96"/>
and in prospect that I might be able to do
so, you have provided me an Explication;
which is, <q>that when God saith, <hi>[This
is my Covenant which</hi> ye <hi>shall keep between
me and</hi> you] in your Opinion, it can be
understood no otherwise then thus, <hi>[be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and</hi> you] that is, between me
and thou <hi>Abraham,</hi> together with thy
Son <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and the <hi>rest</hi> of the Family
now <hi>present</hi> with thee; And not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and you <hi>now present,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>thy Seed</hi> after
thee before expressed.</q>] But oh! sweet
Sir recollect a little here, for I fear you do
mistake your self, These are the very
words of the Paraphrase, the Mizmaze
Paraphrase; However, it makes me hope
we shall agree at last, your off's and on's,
and on's and off's are good signes of it.
No say you, stop there; <hi>For thy Seed after
thee in the 9th. verse, is included in the first</hi>
[ye] <hi>of the 10th. verse,]</hi> But how (say I)
can that be, if it be excluded the <hi>second;</hi>
from which in the 10th. it is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
But to press you the more, I ask you,
doth not in your opinion, [thy Seed in the
9th. verse.] Include the Present as well as
Future Seed? You tell me it doth, else
how came <hi>Ishmael</hi> under the Duty! I ask
again, doth not the <hi>first</hi> ye (or you) in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103760:96"/>
the 10th. verse, in your Opinion include
the Seed in the 9th.? you tell me it doth.
I ask further, doth not the second [you]
in the 10th. verse signifie the same with the
first [ye or you?] here you must be at a
stand, for if the <hi>first</hi> you [or ye] include
the Seed Present and Future, and the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
[you] do signifie the same as the first,
then the second <hi>[you]</hi> must include the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Seed as well as the Present, and so the
addition to it [of <hi>thy Seed after thee</hi>] must
be <hi>superfluous,</hi> and where then, will be the
Mountains of sence hanging on that word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But on the other hand, if you say the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
[you] doth signifie the present Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
only, and the <hi>first</hi> you [or ye] the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
both Present and Future, you make
the Scripture unintelligible, and God not
only to speak ambiguously, but against all
the Rules of Grammar and common speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and against good sence, to make a
<hi>Pronoune Demonstrative</hi> not to Demonstrate,
and though standing in Coherence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
yet not to Cohere, not to Relate.
<hi>This is my Covenant which</hi> you [or ye] <hi>shall
keep between me and</hi> you; What you I pray
now but the First? <hi>You</hi> that are to keep the
Covenant, are to keep it between me and
<hi>you.</hi> To take the <hi>first</hi> you [or ye] for
some Persons, and the <hi>second</hi> for others,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103760:97"/>
is non-sensical: Both standing plainly for
the same, and therefore if [between me
and <hi>you]</hi> be as you say, [between me and
<hi>thee Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and the <hi>rest</hi> of
the Family here present] the first you [or
ye] must be understood of <hi>them</hi> too; and
that's the whole of the Paraphrase.</p>
            <p>However, I am glad you have found the
<hi>present Family</hi> spoken to any where in the
Text, for that granted, I think my sence
above exception, and that it will lye even
with all that goes before, and all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
after; Taking [<hi>thy Seed after thee</hi>]
for <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Letter and Spirit in all the
verses: <hi>I will Establish my Covenant between
me and thee, and</hi> thy Seed; <hi>I will give to
thee and</hi> thy Seed; <hi>Thou shalt keep my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
therefore, thou and</hi> thy Seed. <hi>This

to the present Family, <hi>Abraham</hi> being

you of a bold Abuse you put upon me

keeping of it in the <hi>sign</hi> of it (whatever
the sign at any time be,) and not <hi>particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>determinately,</hi> for keeping of it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
either in Circumcision, or in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
Indeed in that moment, when the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Obligation was imposed of keeping
the sign, neither Baptism nor Circumcision
in <hi>particular was</hi> yet Instituted; Though
Circumcision was, in the very next Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I confess, had the keeping of the
Covenant in the sign of it, which is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
injoyned in the 9th. verse, been a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it <hi>particularly</hi> and Determinately,
in either Baptism or Circumcision; Then
(as you object,) either <hi>Abraham</hi> must have
been <hi>Baptized,</hi> if Baptism had been intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
particularly; or else, <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
[the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the true Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Seed] must have been <hi>Circumcised</hi> if
Circumcision had immediately and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
been meant: But that <hi>term</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
but <hi>generally</hi> and indeterminately;
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed are only obliged <hi>by
it</hi> to keep the Covenant in <hi>some</hi> sign; In that
sign <hi>Respectively,</hi> which should be the sign
of their Respective times: And thus <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did keep it in Circumcision, the sign
in his time; And so did <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as the Natural Off-spring of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
in the sign that then was: But Spiritual <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:103760:98"/>
(or the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi>) could not
keep it in the sign <hi>then;</hi> They not having
being <hi>then,</hi> and so no particular sign was
ordained for them <hi>then;</hi> but when ever
they should be, They (being the Seed of
<hi>Abraham)</hi> are tyed by the Obligation
[verse the 9th] to keep the Covenant in
the sign of it, <hi>viz.</hi> in that sign which then
should be (the sign,) when they became
Seed.</p>
            <p>And on this occasion it may not be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be noted, that though <hi>Isaac</hi> in his
own person, as a Natural Descendant of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> was Circumcised, as in that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
he ought to be; yet (being to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
the Person of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spiritual Seed,
and in the Mystery to stand for and be a
Type of that Seed, which is of the saith
of <hi>Abraham</hi>) he was not as <hi>Ishmael</hi> (who
was the Type and Figure of the Seed
which was of the Law,) <hi>present</hi> at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Ordinance of Circumcision,
designed to be the sign of the Legal Seed;
<hi>Ishmael</hi> was one of those that God did speak
to <hi>[every Man-Child among</hi> you <hi>shall be
Circumcised]</hi> but <hi>Isaac</hi> was not there; He
was unborn: This <hi>Timing</hi> of the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be of some significancy.</p>
            <p>To this I add, for greater Illumination
of the Holy Mystery, that even the <hi>calling
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103760:98"/>
of the Natural Seed in Isaac,</hi> and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating
of the Promises in the Letter,
to the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as it did derive by
<hi>Isaac,</hi> was Mystical; And shewed, that
as all the Promises of God are yea, and
Amen in <hi>Christ,</hi> so that Christians and true
Believers are in <hi>him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the <hi>true</hi> Inheritors of
the Promise, in the Spiritual meaning of it,
and indeed, why else, should the Seed be
called in <hi>Isaac, Gen.</hi> 21. 12. were it not
for a Mystery? For if by Seed, <hi>there</hi> is
meant (as in the Letter it is) only the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Seed,</hi> one would think, it should have
been <hi>more proper</hi> to have called <hi>it</hi> in <hi>Ishmael,</hi>
the Type and Figure of <hi>that</hi> Seed, than in
<hi>Isaac</hi> who represented <hi>Another,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it would have been, if <hi>but</hi> the Carnal
Seed had been called in <hi>Isaac,</hi> without any
Relation, any Aspect at all unto the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.
Here also it may not be improper to
observe the difference in the several Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
which it pleased God to conferr on <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>
and <hi>Isaac, Gen.</hi> 17. 19, 20, 21. no
mention in the least of any <hi>Seed</hi> in the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
of <hi>Ishmael,</hi> though in the fruitfulness
is promised to him, there be an implication
of Children, but in <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Isaac,</hi> there is
mention of <hi>Seed;</hi> The Covenant is Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
with him, and with his Seed after
him: As if the term <hi>Seed</hi> was Mystical
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103760:99"/>
and Spiritual, and did not only signifie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Children, but Spiritual also. Judge
now, whether <hi>Isaac</hi> be not, both in the
Promise, and in the Obligation too, to be
considered as he represents the believing
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> the true Spiritual Seed.</p>
            <p>All that I have offered hitherto, is on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of your <hi>first Reason</hi> to evince, that
<hi>Isaac</hi> in the Spirit, or <hi>Isaac</hi> as he represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Spiritual Seed, is not intended in the
general Obligation verse the 9th. and <hi>that</hi>
was taken from <hi>Isaac</hi> himself: I will now
proceed to the <hi>second,</hi> (for so I do reduce
to order what you in some confusion have
written without any,) and this is from <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael;</hi>
For say you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <q>it was not under that
precise notion that the present Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
verse the 9th. was fastned on him,
<hi>(viz. Isaac)</hi> there being nothing of this
nature mentioned throughout the whole
Context, but rather as he was Descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Flesh,
for otherwise <hi>Ishmael</hi> had been excluded
from the Duty there mentioned, who
could pretend nothing of any Spiritual
Relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Isaac</hi> did, and
yet it cannot be denyed but <hi>Ishmael</hi> was
included therein, as well as <hi>Isaac.</hi>
               </q>]</p>
            <p>But this requires little Answer, as run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
altogether upon Mistakes; For <hi>Isaac
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103760:99"/>
in the Letter</hi> is meant indeed, but <hi>Isaac in
the Spirit</hi> principally. Again, there is as
little in the whole Con-Text mentioned of
<hi>Christ,</hi> (and yet I hope you will not exclude
him too from being meant,) as there is of
the Obligations being fastned on <hi>Isaac, as</hi>
he represented the Spiritual Seed. And
as for <hi>Ishmael,</hi> it was <hi>Abrahams Duty</hi> to
Circumcise him, and he Circumcised him
as he did his Slaves, under the Notion of
his <hi>own,</hi> his Property, and not precisely as
his <hi>Seed.</hi> And if <hi>Ishmael</hi> himself was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any Obligation to Circumcise his (as I
conceive he was,) it was as he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in the <hi>you,</hi> to whom expresly
the command of Circumcision was given,
he was also obliged in <hi>Abraham.</hi> *But
that he was obliged to do it, <hi>as</hi> being <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
Seed,</hi> by vertue of the general injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9. I positively deny. For
<hi>that</hi> Seed only, and no other is obliged by
vertue of the general injunction there,
which is the Object of the Promise before;
That Seed only which is in the Promise in
verse the 8th. is the Seed put under the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in verse the 9th. now <hi>Ishmael</hi> was farr
enough from being the Object of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in verse the 8th. so far, that He is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
and in Termes excluded from it;
The Scripture not only saying, <hi>In</hi> Isaac
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103760:100"/>
               <hi>shall thy Seed be called,</hi> but also, <hi>cast out
the Bond Woman and her</hi> Son <hi>for the</hi> Son <hi>of
this Bond Woman shall</hi> not <hi>be</hi> Heir <hi>with my
Son, with Isaac,</hi> Gen. 21. 10. And now
bethink also, how can the Spiritual Seed as
well as the Carnal in your sence, that is,
<hi>Isaac</hi> as well as <hi>Ishmael</hi> be in the Promise
and the Obligation too, as you say they be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if <hi>Ishmael</hi> were not <hi>Heir</hi> of the Promise,
nor at all in it.</p>
            <p>And here I had dismissed this point, but
that it comes into my mind, that against
<hi>Abrahams</hi> standing (*with <hi>Ishmael</hi> &amp;c.)
in the business of Circumcision for his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Posterity, (which yet is usual in the
Scriptures for the Fathers to do, and is so
(as I noted before) in the very Covenant
of <hi>Noah</hi> which you mentioned;) You ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<hi>How then did he receive Circumcision
as a seal of the Righteousness by Faith.</hi>]
To which I answer very well; for the sign
of Circumcision is Annexed to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and Promise, as now Established; <hi>I
will</hi> Establish <hi>my Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>
of Canaan, it <hi>was made</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and to his Seed before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 7, 8. &amp;c.
18. but <hi>now</hi> is <hi>Ratified</hi> and Confirmed,
and in token of its being <hi>so,</hi> a sign is put
to it; So that the signing of the Covenant
with Circumcision, being in token of its
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103760:100"/>
ratification, was a sealing, (*the sign was
a seal) a Confirming of the Righteousness
by faith; that is, of the Reward of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
or of that Inheritance which
God, for <hi>Abrahams</hi> believing of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to him, (so improbable, so unlikely,
and in Nature so impossible, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that he
should have Seed as the Stars) conferred
upon <hi>him:</hi> For so it must be understood,
as will appear most evidently from a view
of the whole passage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5, 6, 7.
for <hi>there</hi> we have a Relation; <hi>First,</hi> of
Gods <hi>Promise</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was of
Seed as Stars, in the 5th verse; And then
<hi>Secondly,</hi> of <hi>Abrahams belief,</hi> and Faith in
that improbable Promise, in the beginning
of the 6th. verse, <hi>Abraham</hi> believed the
<hi>Lord;</hi> And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> of the <hi>Reward</hi> the
Lord gave him for that his great Faith; and
this, <hi>First,</hi> more <hi>generally,</hi> in the latter
part of the 6th. verse, and he accounted <hi>it
unto him</hi> for Righteousness; That is, the
Lord Rewarded him, for so, in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Holy Scriptures, to account
for Righteousness is; It is graciously to give
a Person the Reward of Righteousness, for
a thing which in it self, is not compleat
Righteousness; And then <hi>Secondly,</hi> more
<hi>Particularly,</hi> how he Rewarded him, and
that is verse the 7th. by giving him the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103760:101"/>
Promise of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>our</hi> Faith is accounted unto us for
Righteousness, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> was to Him;
We have by Divine Grace, the Heavenly
Inheritance for believing in Christ, as He
the Promise of the Temporal, * (though
not that only) for Believing <hi>Jehovah.</hi> And
now, why might not all this be, and yet
<hi>Abraham</hi> * in the business of Circumcision
represent his own Posterity; (* though I
do not positively say he did;) and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because the Reward (* in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
was <hi>Canaan,</hi> which now was Sealed
and Confirmed to him in the sign of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
put to the ratification of that
Covenant and Promise, in which God had
before conveighed, and passed it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have proved <hi>Isaac as</hi> he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
Christ Mystical, or the Spiritual
Seed, to be intended in the Obligation,
verse the 9th. but it seems I might have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so much Ink and Paper, for at last you
tell me plainly, <q>that <hi>Abraham</hi> and all <hi>his,</hi>
Present or Future, Carnal or Spiritual,
were concerned in the <hi>Obligation</hi> as well
as in the Promise, some way or other.
[That is well,] in the Promises Temporal,
the Carnal Seed were concerned, in the
Blessings Temporal and Spiritual, the
Believing Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103760:101"/>
and both the one and the other
[<hi>and what are they,</hi>(say I)<hi>but the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Believing Seed of Abraham,</hi>]
were also concerned in the Obligation,
verse the 9th. [so far you are just, I,
<hi>but you must not be mistaken, you add,</hi>]
(i. e.) to be Circumcised, for <hi>Isaac,</hi> and
all the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> were Circumcised
as well as <hi>Ishmael.</hi>
               </q>] And what, Dear
Sir, was <hi>Isaac</hi> and the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> the
only believing Seed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> And
doth <hi>Isaac</hi> stand but for believing <hi>Jews,</hi> and
not for believing <hi>Gentiles?</hi> I pray, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
your self unto the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 3. 14,
15, 16. &amp;c.</hi> and 4. 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to 31. and
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18, 16. And remember, I have
clearly proved, in the Correct Copy of my
first Letter, that <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> are, the
former the Seed under the Law, the latter,
Believers under the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ay! but what if <hi>Isaac</hi> stand in the
Obligation, verse the 9th. for the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Seed or believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> what
then? What is this to the Baptism of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</q>]
I answer, I referr you for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answer to the Corrected Copy of my
first Letter; There you may plainly see,
what it is to Infants Baptism; I repeat it
not, because it would be endless to go round,
and say over again the same things: A Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103760:102"/>
is infinite; There is <hi>another</hi> word for
you to whet on, but I hope you will not
mistake it for <hi>[God,]</hi> as you did the word
<hi>Eternal</hi> in my last for [in Eternity,] against
common use,</p>
            <p>Aeterno sed erunt tibi magna Volumina
versu. <hi>Tibul l. 2. The like in</hi> Cicera, <hi>and
in</hi> Seneca, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I hope I have most ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Asserted the Paraphrase I made upon the
Text in Controversie; The <hi>Paraphrase</hi> do
I say, or dare I mention <hi>that</hi> again! why
<hi>that,</hi>that is, <q>
                  <hi>to you,</hi> the most involved,
tortious, intricate that ever you heard of,
except <hi>Origens</hi> Allegorical and Mystical
Commentaries</q>] And I believe you; but
then, how well the Apostle, who is my
Author, will escape your censure, I know
not, but it is well for him, and for me too,
that the Paraphrase is <hi>all</hi> this but <hi>unto you;</hi>
The sizes of Humane understanding are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different, and yours is not the Measure
and Standard of good sence, or of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
others more unbyassed, and as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
persons will not think the <hi>worse</hi> of
the Paraphrase, nor the <hi>better</hi> of you for
your calling it <hi>names.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:103760:102"/>Only, as to the great <hi>adoe</hi> you make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the disjunctive Particle [but] inserted in
my Paraphrase, I must tell you, that but a
grain of either the Candour of which you
make profession, or of true soundness of
Judgment, would have prevented it. For
that [but,] I did not add it unto the Text;
I never insisted on it; I only put it in a <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis</hi>
to shew that a Particle (as small as
that was) if understood and supplyed (as
the like is done many times in other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and must be done to make the sence
entire, see <hi>Job.</hi> 16. 5.) would have put my
sence of the Text out of question. I but
put it in to make you sensible of my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
which conceived, you might leave it
out again, for my sence is good without it;
and the connexive particle [now] would
do as well to my purpose, and one of them,
to make the sence compleat, must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
if by [you,] you mean restrictive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
those there present only: in the one
[you] you do, and therefore must in both,
the reason is the same for both, as for one.</p>
            <p>Let it be granted (as by you it is) that
God doth speak to any in the term [you]
as present, I may make good my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
against the World, for the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103760:103"/>
of an <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> is all that seemeth
Harsh and Difficult in it; Suppose him to
mean but them there present in the first
[you;] that is, to mean <hi>that</hi> in the <hi>first,</hi>
which you your self do grant he means in
the <hi>second,</hi> and the business is ended. But
as for your <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> it is too general
and loose, and off from the Text, and not
a Paraphrase upon it.</p>
            <p>What you add in answer to my several
questions, is but Retailing of what I had
<hi>before,</hi> and have again considered <hi>now</hi> in
gross; only where you say, <q>that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Holy Ghost useth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictive

it would have been improper to
have <hi>repeated</hi> the word Seed, (according
to the usual <hi>formes of Speech</hi> generally in
custom among men) it being enough when
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed had been <hi>once</hi> or
<hi>twice</hi> mentioned to say [you] as there
was further occasion to make mention of
them.</q>]</p>
            <p>I answer, that it is not once or twice,
but <hi>four</hi> times, and that is <hi>alwayes</hi> all along
[thee and thy Seed] before he came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103760:103"/>
Circumcision, which was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
to all the Seed: And why I pray,
not Humane <hi>formes of Speech</hi> observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by the using of [you], after once or
twice mentioning, instead of [thee and thy
Seed:]</p>
            <p>Again, shew me, among all the <hi>formes
of Speech</hi> generally in custom among men,
one such as <hi>this</hi> is in <hi>your sence,</hi> where <hi>two</hi>
you's, in the same Coherence and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
shall be understood diversely; The
<hi>first</hi> of them for one subject, the <hi>second</hi> for
<hi>another: This is the Covenant which you
shall keep between</hi> me <hi>and</hi> you, which <hi>you</hi>
shall keep, meaning some persons; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and you, meaning other Persons.
If this be your <hi>Grammar,</hi> it is new too,
and all as new as your <hi>Logick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, in your sence it would have run
smooth, and more according to the <hi>formes
of Speech</hi> generally in custom among men,
in these termes; <hi>Thou shalt keep my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
therefore thou and thy Seed; This
is the Covenant which</hi> you <hi>shall keep between

But [thy Seed] being put in with
