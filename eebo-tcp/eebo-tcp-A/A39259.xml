         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> IS not <hi>Religion,</hi> or the Fear of
<hi>GOD,</hi> your whole duty?</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>Yes. To fear GOD, and keep
his Commandments, is the whole duty of
man,</hi> Eccl. XII. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Can you fear <hi>GOD,</hi> if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not first that there is a <hi>GOD?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>No. I must first believe that GOD</hi>
is, <hi>Heb.</hi> XI. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Do you mean by <hi>GOD,</hi> the
Maker of all things?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. He that built all things, is
GOD, <hi>Heb. III.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Do you know by the things that
are made, that there is a <hi>GOD?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. By the things that are made

<hi>GOD</hi> by his Word?</p>
            <p>

unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in
these last days spoken unto us by his SON,

bones, <hi>Luke XXIV.</hi> 34.</p>

life, <hi>Psal. XXXVI.</hi> 9.</p>

            <p>

            <p>Q. Are we then made members of
CHRIST in baptism?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:109395:31"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. We are baptized into one body,
which is his body, 1 <hi>Cor. XII. 13. Eph. I.</hi>
22, 23.</p>
            <p>Q. Are we made the Children of
GOD?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. We are the children of GOD
by faith in CHRIST IESVS; for
as many as have been baptized into
CHRIST, have put on CHRRST,
<hi>Gal. III.</hi> 26, 27.</p>
            <p>Q. Are we made inheritors of the
Kingdom of Heaven?</p>
            <p>A. Yes. For if children, then heirs of
GOD, <hi>Rom. VIII.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>Q. Did not the Apostles call for
repentance and faith in persons to be
baptized?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. They commanded them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and believe, with all their heart,
<hi>Acts II. 38. VIII.</hi> 37.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is not <hi>Repentance</hi> a change of
heart and life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. A turning from all our sins
unto the LORD, amending our ways
and our doings, <hi>Ezek. XVIII. 28, 30.
Isa. LV. 7. Jer. VII.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:109395:32"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Was the Sacrament of the
<hi>LORD's Supper</hi> ordain'd by <hi>CHRIST?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> received of the
LORD, that which he hath delivered
unto us, That the LORD IESVS
the same night in which he was betrayed,
took bread: And when he had given
thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat;
This is my Body, which is broken for you:
this do in remembrance of me. After the
same manner also he took the Cup, saying,
This Cup is the New Testament in my
blood: This do ye, as oft as ye drink it,
in remembrance of me, 1 <hi>Cor. XI.</hi> 23,
24, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are we to receive this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in remembrance of CHRIST's
death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. As often as we eat this bread,
and drink this cup, we shew forth the
LORD's death, 1 <hi>Cor XI.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is this Ordinance to continue
for ever?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. Till CHRIST come. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:109395:32"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is his death to be remembred
as a Sacrifice for us?</p>
            <p>A. Yes. For CHRIST our Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
was sacrificed for us. He gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an offering and a sacrifice to GOD
for a sweet-smelling savour, 1 <hi>Cor. V. 7.
Eph. V.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What do the outward signs of
bread and wine signify?</p>
            <p>A. They signify the Body and Blood of
CHRIST, the living bread which came
down from heaven, 1 <hi>Cor. XI. 24, 25.
John VI.</hi> 51.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is CHRIST crucified, the food
of our Souls?</p>
            <p>A. Yes. His flesh is meat indeed, and
his blood is drink indeed; he that eateth
him, shall live by him, <hi>John VI.</hi> 55,
57.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Must you really and indeed eat
and drink the Body and blood of
CHRIST?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. Except we eat the flesh of the
Son of man, and drink his blood, we have
no life in us, <hi>John VI.</hi> 53.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:109395:33"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Must you eat and drink CHRIST's
natural Body and Blood with your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Teeth, as you do other meat?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No. It is the Spirit that quickeneth,
the flesh profiteth nothing, <hi>John VI.</hi> 63.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What, is it only Bread and Wine
then that you chew and swallow
down?</p>
            <p>A. Yes. I eat that bread, and drink
that cup which CHRIST blessed, brake
and gave to be eaten and drunk, 1 <hi>Cor.
XI.</hi> 25, 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Do you eat and drink CHRIST's
Body and Blood only spiritually, and
by faith?</p>
            <p>A. Yes. He that cometh to CHRIST,
and believeth on him, shall never hunger,
nor thirst, but shall have everlasting life,
<hi>John VI.</hi> 35, 40.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> When you take, and eat, and
drink bodily the Bread and Wine, do
you spiritually, and by faith, feed on
CHRIST crucified?</p>
            <p>A. Yes. The cup that is blessed, is the
communion of the blood of CHRIST;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109395:33"/>
and the bread which is broken, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the body of CHRIST,
1 <hi>Cor. X.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Q. Is it not a dangerous thing to
receive this Bread and Wine unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily?</p>
            <p>A. Yes. Whosoever eateth and drinketh
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation
to himself, 1 <hi>Cor. XI.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>Q. Ought you not then diligently to
examine your self before-hand, whether
you be worthy or no?</p>
            <p>A. Yes. Let a man examine himself,
and so let him eat of that bread, and drink
of that cup, 1 <hi>Cor. XI.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>Q. Are you to examine if you be a
good Christian, keeping faith and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with GOD?</p>
            <p>A. Yes. We must examine our selves,
whether we be in the faith; and prove our
own selves, till we know our own selves, how
that CHRIST is in us, 2 <hi>Corinth.
XIII.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Doth your eating CHRIST
confirm more and more your union
with CHRIST?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:109395:34"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. He that eateth <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s
flesh, and drinketh his blood, dwelleth in
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> and <hi>CHRIST</hi> in him,
<hi>John VI.</hi> 56.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Shall you not be condemn'd if
you be in CHRIST, or a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?</p>
            <p>A. No. There is no condemnation to
them that are in <hi>CHRIST JESUS,
Rom. VIII.</hi> 1.</p>
