            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>O Bleſſed Lord, who in thine infinite mercy didſt vouchſafe to plant a glorious Church among us, and now in thy juſt judgment haſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted our ſins and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to root it up; be pleaſed at laſt to reſume thoughts of Peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, that we may do the like to one another.

               <p>O Moſt gracious Lord, who doſt not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men, who
<pb facs="tcp:31551:7"/>
ſmiteſt not till the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of our ſins enforce thee, and then correcteſt in meaſure; we thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Creatures hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly acknowledge that we have abundantly taſted of this patience and leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thine. To what an enormous height were our ſins arrived, e'er thou began'ſt to viſit them! and when thou couldſt no longer forbear, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering thy Power, thou haſt not proportion'd thy vengeance to our crimes, but to thy own gracious deſign of reducing and
<pb facs="tcp:31551:8"/>
reclaiming us. Lord, had the firſt ſtroke of thy hand been extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, our guilts had ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified the method; but thou haſt proceeded by ſuch eaſie and gentle degrees, as witneſs how much thou deſired'ſt to be interrupted, and ſhew us, that all that ſad weight we have long groaned under, hath been accumulated only by our own incorrigibleneſs. 'Tis now, O Lord, theſe many years that this Nation hath been in the Furnace, and yet our
<pb facs="tcp:31551:8"/>
droſs waſtes not, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes; and it is owing only to thy unſpeakable Mercy, that we, who would not be purified, are not conſumed; that we remain a Nation, who ceaſe not to be a moſt ſinful and provoking Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O Lord, let not this long-ſuffering of thine ſerve only to upbraid our obſtinacy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance our guilt; but let it at laſt have the proper effect on us, melt our hearts, and lead us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And, O that this may be the day for
<pb facs="tcp:31551:9"/>
us, thus to diſcern the things that belong to our Peace! that all who are (yea, and all who are not) caſt down this day in an external humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may by the operation of thy mighty Spirit have their Souls laid proſtrate before thee in a ſincere contrition! O thou who canſt out of the very ſtones raiſe up Children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> work our ſtony flinty hearts into ſuch a temper as may be malleable to the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy Grace, that all the ſinners in <hi>Sion</hi> may
<pb facs="tcp:31551:9"/>
tremble; that we may not by a perſering ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionacy ſeal to our ſelves both temporal and eternal ruine, but inſtead of our mutinous complaining at the puniſhments of our ſins, ſearch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. O be thou pleaſed to grant us this one grand fundamental Mercy, that we who ſo impatiently thirſt after a change without us, may render that poſſible and ſafe by this better and more neceſſary change within us; that our ſins
<pb facs="tcp:31551:10"/>
may not, as they have ſo often done, interpoſe and eclipſe that Light which now begins to break out upon us. Lord, thy Dove ſeems to approach us with an Olive Branch in her mouth: On let not our filth and noiſomneſs chaſe her away; but grant us that true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which may atone thee, and that Chriſtian Charity which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Lord, let not our breach either with thee, or among our ſelves, be incurable, but by making
<pb facs="tcp:31551:10"/>
up the firſt, prepare us for the healing of the latter. And becauſe, O Lord, the way to make us one Fold is to have one Shepherd, be pleaſed to put us all under the conduct of him to whom that charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; bow the hearts of this People as of one Man, that the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention may be, who ſhall be moſt forward in bringing back our <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> O let none reflect on their paſt Guilts, as an Argument to perſevere, but repent, and to make their return ſo ſincere as
<pb facs="tcp:31551:11"/>
may qualifie them, not only for his but thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And, Lord, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo to guide the hearts of all who ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with that great Concernment of ſetling this Nation, that they may weigh all their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations in the Balance of the Sanctuary, that Conſcience, not Intereſt, may be the ruling prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and that they may render to <hi>Coeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Coeſar</hi>'s, and to God the things that are God's; that they may become healers of
<pb facs="tcp:31551:11"/>
our breaches, and happy Repairers of the ſad Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines both in Church and State: And grant, O Lord, that as thoſe ſins which made them are become National, ſo the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may be National alſo, and that evidenc'd by the proper fruits of it, by zeal of reſtoring the rights both of thee and thine Anointed. And do thou, O Lord, ſo diſpoſe all hearts, and remove all obſtacles, that none may have the will, much leſs the power, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his peaceable reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
<pb facs="tcp:31551:12"/>
And, Lord, let him bring with him an heart ſo intirely devoted to thee, that he may wiſh his own Honour only as a means to advance thine. O let the precepts and example of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Father never depart from his Mind; and as thou wert pleas'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the one by ſuffering, ſo perfect the other by acting thy will; that He may be a bleſſed Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of replanting the power in ſtead of the form of Godlineſs among us, of reſtoring Chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:31551:12"/>
vertue in a profane and almoſt barbarous Nation.
