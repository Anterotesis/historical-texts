            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Baron of Essingdon, principall Secretarie to the

The gratious and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing,
when they die,
leaue behind them a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that can neuer die.
I instance this in Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of
blessed memory: A Lady beyond example,
beautifyed with the ornaments of <hi>Grace</hi>
and <hi>Nature</hi> (the twoo handes of God)
whose name (like the aire) is spread ouer
<pb facs="tcp:9939:3"/>
all the earth, whereby this our little world
(the English nation) is made famous to
all posteritie. And because I my selfe haue
seene many the admirations of her time,
&amp; haue with many others shared in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of those blessings which God
did giue her most gratious and fortunate
gouernement; I haue therefore (willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
forced my endeuours to this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of thankes, hauing euer vowed
my selfe a seruant to her Honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.
The reasons (my good L.)
of dedication are these: First, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
honorable deseruing, in being a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Supporter of the leaning State of
learning, the <hi>Moecenas</hi> and Patron of
the learned (in what deseruing qualitie
soeuer:) wherein, (though I be but meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profest) yet, your Lordeships zealous
regard to the profession I beare, shal euer
binde me in the most assured bonds of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:9939:3"/>
and thankefull seruice. Againe, that
honorable testimony of your Lordships re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,
euen to the very name of your late
Soueraigne, approued by the generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
and acclamation of all good people:
by which act, your Lordship hath procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the highest degree of good opinion,
and by giuing Honour to her that best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
it, deseruedly made your selfe much
honoured.</p>
            <p>And therefore (my good Lord) haue
I ventured on your Lordships gratious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
humbly requesting your Honor,
that my particular (howsoeuer vnworthy,
to trauaile in so honorable an Argument)
may (notwithstanding) haue gratious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
being presented in the name of
Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to whose honorable
remembraunce your Lordeship is so much
deuoted, and to whose name I haue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
dedicated this seruice: beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:9939:4"/>
Almightie God to deriue vppon your

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He name of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is sufficient
Argument to perswade a friendly acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and from the better disposed (whome I
couet principally to please) I shall doubtlesse
receiue that reasonable and honest construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As for those who haue their tongues
dipt in the poyson of Enuie, I write not to please them,
who wil neuer be pleasd with that which is most deseruing;
It being the nature of Enuie, to depraue that, which dooth
deserue the highest fauour of loue and good opinion. I may
example this in the wrong offered to the name of Queene
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who (though shee were the most admired of her
time) hauing extraordinary induments, and a gouernment,
much more in the degrees of honour and prosperitie, than
any her Predecessours: yet want there not malitious and
base deprauers, who (like dogges that barke against the
Sunne) couet to bite her honourable name, whome God
hath made more glorious than the Sunne, giuing her a place
of glorie, in fellowship with his holy Angelles and Saints.
For this double respect haue I therefore taken these paines:
First to please the well affected, in honouring her whome
all that haue honesty will honour: Next, in giuing Enuie
and her sonnes a morsell to bite vpon; wishing that all the
deprauers of her princely name, may either reduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
some degree of honestie, or else perish with their
enuious and euill breath, Accept then (I pray thee) these my
voluntarie trauells; and honour her remembraunce, whome
all the best in the world do honour with admiration, which
thou also wilt doe, if thou beest either honest, or truely En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</p>

               <l>Too confident in your suspected faith,</l>
               <l>It would be better to cast off pretence,</l>
