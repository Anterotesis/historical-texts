         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

twoe ſundry tymes put to print in <hi>England</hi>
(whear I was then in Priſon) it was both
tymes taken, though it doth not in any wiſe
touch either Controuerſies or matters of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.
Since which tyme hath bein erected that
your Religious howſe at <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and aſwell

ſayd (for the ſame cauſes of kinred and

<hi>Bonum quò communius eo melius,</hi> The good is
ſo much the better, by how much it is
<pb facs="tcp:15475:9"/>
more common: and (finally) for that the

of your vocation; I haue thought good to

wayeng leſſe in the one ſcale of the ballance

eſpecially the Ballance being held in the hand
of that charitable affection which ſhall neuer
ceaſe to worke, and doe the office which kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

And though the thing both in reſpect of it
ſelf, and of ſo ſinfull and vile a wretch from
whome it cometh, be of ſo ſmall valew and
ſo vnworthy the printing, that I haue often
tymes hindred the ſame (howſoeuer the

of authoritie as of learning and perfection;
and ſeing it ſo much publiſhed throughout

bein more encouraged to preſent the ſame
vnto yow: though for the third part therof, it
is not thought meet to be publiſhed, as trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

it as the end of our actions, but this as

into the knowledge, taſt, and feeling of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

and <hi>Supereminent</hi> lyfe, is thear touched
in the beginning of that booke of <hi>Actiue</hi> lyfe.
And if this had affinitie with that, it would

all to one only point, in which may ſhine and
cleerly be ſeene all the others, and which (not
withſtanding ſuch breuitie) might be eaſie to
comprehend, and perſpicuous to vnderſtand:
to which effect I could find no point ſo fit as
this of the <hi>vvill of God;</hi> for though the perfect
ſoule and illuminated ſpirit cleerly doth ſee
and diſcerne all wayes and exerciſes in euery
one, and euery one in all, principally in the
higheſt and moſt ſublime; yet is this verified
rather in this exerciſe and point of the <hi>vvill of
God</hi> then in any other; for that heer in all the
other exerciſes are ſo cleerly ſeene, that not
only the perfect and illuminated perſon, but
alſo the beginner (if hee will a little conſider)
may ſee them all, and how in the ſame conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Breuitie.</note> this exerciſe of the <hi>vvill of God</hi>
ſhall be found without all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
ſhort then any other; for, that which others
doe effect by many circumſtances, multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
changings, and degrees, this effecteth at
once by one only application of intention.
As for example, one that following any other
practiſe would be humble, patient, obedient,
or would be diſpiſed, to imitate the paſsion of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15475:12"/>
our Sauiour, would imitate the paſsion to be
conformable to the Sonne of God; would be
conformable vnto him to pleaſe God and

would eſchew euill company to auoid temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
would auoid temptation to flie ſynne;
would fly ſynne to eſcape hell; would eſcape
hell to be ſaued; would be ſaued becauſe it is

muche preferred before other exerciſes, as
the end before the meanes.</p>
                  <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Fitt for all.</note> this exerciſe is more proper and
conuement to all ſorts of people then any

                  <p>It is likewiſe more aſſured from deceipts,<note place="margin">Sure from deceipts.</note>
becauſe it is a continuall abnegation of the

                  <p>But aboue all,<note place="margin">The end and the meanes.</note> this point of the <hi>vvill of God</hi>
excelleth all others in as much as it ſerueth
for a rule, and for the end of our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the others ſerue but for the one or the

not onely exterior, but alſo interior,
declaring by his rectitude the obliquitie as
well of the one as of the others: of the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
becauſe it declareth which are to be
done, and which to be leſt vndone, how and at
what tyme to take anything in hand, how
and in what ſeaſon to endure: of the interior,
in as much as it ſheweth how to will and how

rectifieng and cutting of all the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
and tortuoſitie of our actions as well
interne, as externe. It is alſo the end of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; end (I ſay) proportioned to euery
mans capacitie, ſhewing it ſelf to ſome as
externe, to others as interne, and to others as
eſſentiall, which is God himſelf: end (I ſay
againe) to which the ſoule commes and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres,
not by the interruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the meanes,
but by the continuation of the ſame; not as to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15475:14"/>
another thing different from the meanes, (as
it happens in the other exrciſes) but as to the
ſame and one thing with the meanes, which
is proper to this exerciſe:<note place="margin">Similie.</note> it being like a ſea
the water wherof is all one at the ſhore and
beginning as in the maine Ocean and end
therof, wherin our ſoule doth nauigate and
mount by continuation of the ſame tract
without any variation, change of obiect, or
multiplicitie.</p>
                  <p>And no leſſe hath it this excellencie in
particular aboue all others;<note place="margin">6. Perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</note> namely, that
wheras others are not durable, nor can be
allwayes vſed and practiſed during a mans
whole life, but muſt be left and laid a ſide
and others practiſed according as a man
goeth forward in perfection; this contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
is permanent and ſerueth a man, and is
alwayes continued aſwell in the actiue as
in the contemplatiue and vnitiue life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
changing or interrupting his courſe of
exerciſe, or breaking the thread of his
ſpirituall practiſe; which is no little ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
good nor ſmalle profit, ſeeing that
therby much diſtraction and hndrance
is auoided, proceeding from the change and
multiplicitie of exerciſe.<note place="margin">Similie.</note> For, euen as the
child that goeth from one booke or ſchoole
to another is much troubled and new to
ſeeke; ſo is hee which changeth from one
exerciſe to another; yea, ſome tymes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15475:14"/>
and that often, man that changeth often, or
hath many exerciſes knoweth not well how
to practiſe any of them all, and that eſpecialie
in tyme of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation and ſpirituall warre:<note place="margin">Similie.</note> for
as he which will learne to ſence with many
kinds of weapons, commonly is not cunning
at any, in ſo much that the enimy aſſayling
him he is eaſilie hurt or killed for want of ſkill,
ſo he that hath diuers exerciſes, ordinarilie
knoweth not the perfect practiſe of any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and therfore the enimies, the world, the fleſh
and the deuell aſſalting him, foorthwith
is either ſlaine or maymed. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſoule hauing her will already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled
by the impulſion of the temptation
flieng to her exerciſe and ſpirituall weapon,
and not being skillfull in handling the ſame,
the enimy whoe ſeeth and knoweth it well, is
more encouraged to purſue and follow the
weakned will, and ſhee diſcouraged and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to reſiſt. Yea, ſome men haue ſo many
exerciſes that in tyme of battayle they know
not which to betake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to, and ſo many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes
to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they follow none; ſo acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pliſhing
the prouerbe that ſayth, <hi>Qui duos inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatur
lepores, neutru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> capit,</hi> He that hunteth two
hares cacheth neither. But otherwiſe it is with
him that hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually one only exerciſe, for
that without diſtractio of ſpirit, or diſsipation
of ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces heere and thear in diuerſitie of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
he remaineth alwayes recollected, and his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15475:15"/>
with all his powers gathered togeather, and
fixed in one, ſo that he penetrateth the ſame
euen to the bottome and profunditie therof,
and ſo walketh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in the light therof,
practiſing the ſame and conforming his life
therunto, and ſo when the enemy commes to
aſſaulte him he is not vnprouided of his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
nor doubtfull which to betake him vnto,
becauſe he hath but one at which he is very
cunning as bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his daylie practiſe. And fina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is reſolute and ſtable in his way, and maner
of the purſute of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as not knowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but that by which he ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth the right way
with all aſſurance. Heerin therfore doth this
exerciſe in particular excell all others, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
none of them may be continually practiſed
all a mans life, but muſt be changed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the ſoule changeth eſtate and ariſeth
in perfection, vſing ſome at the beginning,
others in the progreſſe, and others in the end,
but in this exerciſe a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt begin, proceed,
and end: ſo that this <hi>vvill of God</hi> is a ſpirituall
Sea in which each one may ſaile according to
the burthen of his veſſell; ſo as the ſhallops of
the weake ſoules of beginners doe flote in the
roade of the ſhallow waters of the <hi>exterior vill;</hi>
the barks of ſuche as be adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced doe hoiſt ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le;
and la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che far ther into the depth of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior

And as this will of God is like the ſea,<note place="margin">Similie notand.</note> ſo
the obſcuritie of our proper will is like the
lande; and as he which is in the midſt of the
land ſeeth not the ſea at all, ſo he that is in the
midſt of obſcure proper will ſeeth not this
celeſtial Ocean. And as the greater and more
ſpacious the lande is, ſo much farther one is
from ſeing the ſea; ſo how much greater is
this proper will ſo muche farther is he from
ſeing this <hi>vvill of God.</hi> Againe, as where the ſea
gaineth the land, ther is nothing ſeene but the
ſea, and as according to the meaſure that it
ouerfloweth the land the ſea appeareth; ſo
wher the <hi>vvill of God</hi> getteth the vpper hand,
ther is ſo farr nothing but that will; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the <hi>vvill of God</hi> ouerfloweth the
darknes of our proper will, it taketh place,
and is plainly ſeene. Finaly, as if ther were no
land at all thear would be nothing but ſea; ſo if
wee had no darknes at all of proper will, we
ſhould ſee nothing but the <hi>vvill of God;</hi> and
as he that is in the mideſt of the maine ſea

the <hi>vvill of God,</hi> and only to pleaſe him, is an
intention farr excelling them all, the others
hauing their end and object only to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
directly, and to the Creator indirectly;
yea ſo farr excelleth this intention the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as hee that doth things natural with
this intention, as to walke, yea though they
bee pleaſant, as to eate and drink, doth more
merit and pleaſe God then hee which

                  <p>VVhear may be noted certaine deceipts and
abuſes:<note place="margin">1. Deceipt.</note> firſt, of thoſe whoe meaſure all their
works, and eſteeme their merit only or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
by their exterior, they taking contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riewiſe
their merit from the interior, or end
wherfore they be done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Deceipt.</note> by this rule appeareth the loſſe
of merit, light, and grace, of the moſt part of
men which doe their naturall works natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and not ſupernaturally as they might doe
by this intention, which maketh ſuch works
naturall and humaine, ſupernaturall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Deceipt.</note> of thoſe which not only in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
things but alſo in ſupernaturall and good
works, as almes, faſting, ſayeng diuine ſeruice
<hi>etc,</hi> forget to addreſſe their intention to God,

                     </gap> doing them either becauſe they can not
auoid them, or els of cuſtome not thinking
wherfore.</p>
                  <p>Fourthlie,<note place="margin">4. Deceipt.</note> of thoſe which doe their works
for reward in heauen, for though they ſhalbe
rewarded, and though it be good ſo to doe
them, yet is it better without compariſon to
doe them only for Gods will and to pleaſe
him, not thinking (as much as is poſsible) of
any reward; and how much the leſſe hee ſo
worketh, ſo much the more ſhall hee be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15475:23"/>
as approching ſo much the neerer to
the nature of a Sonne; and contrariewiſe
how muche the more hee ſo worketh for
reward, ſo much the leſſe ſhall hee be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as ſo much more approching to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a mercenarie or ſeruant.</p>
                  <p>Finally,<note place="margin">5. Deceipt.</note> by this rule may appeare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
blindnes of men, whoe for the moſt part
doe their works for other ends, and not for
this of the <hi>vvill of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may heer obiect and ſay;<note place="margin">Objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> that if ſo
it be (as wee ſay) that the worke taketh her
merit only of the interior, and that an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
and naturall worke with this intention
of the <hi>vvill of God</hi> is more noble and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
then the greateſt worke done with any
other intention, then conſequently to receiue
that diuine Sacrament of the Altar or any
other, is not a better worke then to walke,
eate, or drinke.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſvver.</note> that in receiuing the Sacraments
thear be twoe things to be conſidered; one is
the Sacrament as a Sacrament inſtituted by
God to conferre grace; the other is the ſimple
receauing therof, as being our worke and wee
the Author therof. If then wee haue reſpect
vnto the firſt, it is a better worke without
compariſon then our ordinarie works, hauing
an excellency in it ſelfe as of it ſelfe; but if
wee haue regard vnto the other, it is nothing
better, hauing no excellency in it ſelf as of it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15475:24"/>
ſelf but is good, better, or beſt of all according
to the intention, yea euell alſo, for in Iudas it
was bad,<note place="margin">2. Obiection.</note> and in the other Apoſtles verie good.</p>
                  <p>If any one obiect that if the worke take
her merit only of the end, then at leaſt as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the works of penance, as diſcipline, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
almeſdeeds, they are no better then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
works being done with this good end
and intention of the <hi>vvill of God</hi> aſwell as
they.<note place="margin">Ansvver.</note> I anſwer, that it followeth not; for
though the worke take her merit only of the
end for which it is done, yet are not common
works equall with the works of penance if
both haue the ſame end, but the penall works
merit more, becauſe that beſides the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

in them as they are iuſt; and are alſo a
preſeruation from the ſynns to come, for (as
ſayth the Philoſopher) <hi>Paenae medicinae ſunt,</hi>
pains are medicins. VVherfore, when wee ſay
that the worke taketh all her good of the end,
wee meane all the good which it hath more
then it had before in it ſelfe; ſo that, if two
works de done for this <hi>vvill of God,</hi> wherof the
one is good in it ſelfe, as almes or faſting; the
other neither good nor bad in it ſelfe, as to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15475:24"/>
walke or talke; the firſt of theſe works ſhalbe
the better, namely ſo much the better as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
or faſting is better then walking or tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
but if twoe works that be equall in them
ſelfes be done, one for this ſaid end of the
<hi>vvill of God,</hi> the other for another, as to goe
to heauen; the firſt without compariſon ſhall
be the beſt: yea which is more, if twoe works
wherof the one is very good in it ſelfe, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting;
the other neither good nor bad, as
walking, bee done, the firſt for to auoid hell,
or to come to heauen, the other for the <hi>vvill

which ſeemeth a hindrance or let to our
aboue ſaid Rule, teaching that in all things
wee muſt do it. In this caſe therfore, whear no
lawe reſolueth the matter but leaueth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
Reaſon muſt beare the ſway, by
which word (Reaſon) is meant Diſcretion,
piety, and counſaile. How in particular this

thing, ſhall forthwith in the next chapter be

declared. Further I ſay, it is a (Rule) of all our
thoughts, words, and deeds, becauſe that as the

the reaſons on both ſides, as in veritie a man

                  <p>For better intelligence wherof, becauſe this
point is of great conſequence, as being euen
the verie knott of the ſpiritual life; and becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe

                  <p>VVee muſt then knowe and remember,<note place="margin">Note vvell.</note>
that thear be twoe partes of our ſoule, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

wherof the one is allwayes contrarie to the

his lawe, becauſe of her free will which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
and grace which is all wayes readie: but
the part which is ſenſible is not ſo allwayes

but the euill which I would not, that doe I.</p>
                  <p>Further, becauſe God is not vniuſt, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
and cruell, but contrariewiſe iuſt, ſweet
and mercifull, hee hath not commaunded vs
things vnpoſsible and aboue our power, or
impoſed a burthen heauie to be caried, but
contrariewiſe hath commaunded that which
is eaſie,<note place="margin">1. Ioan. 5. Matt. 11.</note> as is ſaid, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>data eius non ſunt grauia,</hi> His

conſequence though hee hath commaunded
vs to keepe this ſpirituall part wholy ſubiect
to his lawe being (as is ſayd) a thing poſsible,
yet hah hee not commaunded ſo to keepe
ſubiect the ſenſible, being (as is ſhewed) a
thing impoſsible, but only to keepe it ſo
much ſubiect as wee can, by due mortification
and by the rule of reaſon: wherfore this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of the inferior part is neuer any ſynne

it ſo troubleth reaſon, and obſcureth the

                  <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> that neither is it neceſſarie that

wee ſhould be in more danger to fall by pride

may wee know it aſmuch as is for our good,<note place="margin">Hovv to knovv yf a ma haue conſented.</note>
and aſmuch as God ſeeth to be healthfull for

which knowledge and aſſurance cometh two

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
hee thinke that hee neuer gaue ouer

ſeemed not ſo ſtrong; for though it ſeemed
weake,<note place="margin">Tvvoe cauſes of vveak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> this weaknes might come of twoe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
firſt, for want of good will to reſiſt, and
then it is in deed ſuch as it ſeemeth, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weake; and ſo is very like to haue
offended. Secondly, this weaknes may come
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15475:35"/>
by reaſon of the impulſion of the temptation
cauſing great feeling and delectation in the
inferior parte drowning (as it were) the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
feeling and knowledge, of reſiſtance, and
goodwill; which notwithſtanding liueth and
keepeth entire in the ſuperior parte, and then
this want of reſiſtance is not ſuch is it ſeemeth,
but is in deed verie great, and ſo hee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhall I knowe (ſay yow) of which
of theſe twoe cauſes this feeble reſiſtance co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth?<note place="margin">5. Doubt. Reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>
I aunſwer, by the aboue ſaid habituall
and continuall firme purpoſe and reſolution
neuer to commit ſynne; for if hee be not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to haue this purpoſe, hee may know
when hee feeleth none or almoſt no will to
reſiſt the temptation, that hee hath none in
deed; but if hee haue this generall purpoſe
hee may verily thinke that hee hath reſiſted
and kept pure his ſpirit and the powers therof,
though like the three children in the glowing

                  <p>Moreouer, it muſt heer be noted that
when wee ſpeake of things commaunded or
forbidden, wee intend not only the great
things which were mortall ſynne to committ
them or to leaue them vndone, but alſo little
matters which being commaunded were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
ſynne or imperfection to omit, or being
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15475:35"/>
forbidden were the like to committ, for heer
wee treat not only of the obſeruing of Gods
commandements, but principally of the way
to perfection, which conſiſteth in auoyding of
imperfections: and heer alſo muſt alwayes be
remembred that (as is aboue ſaid) by this word
(lawe or commaundement) I meane not only
the lawe of God and of his church, but of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
ſpirituall and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall, as likewiſe of the
order, ſtate, and condition of euery one, and
finally of the commaundement or intention
(not contrarie to God) of father, mother, or
any other to whom wee are bownd to obay;
ſo that whenas by any of theſe kind of lawes,
commaundements, or intentions wee ought
to doe or leaue vndone any thing, hee ſhould
much deceiue himſelfe which ſhould doe the
contrarie be the thing neuer ſo ſmall, though
vnder pretext of perfection or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation,
becauſe (as is written) <hi>Melior eſt obedientia quàm
victimae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Reg. 11.</note> Obedience is better then ſacrifices.
And whoeſoeuer ſhould ſo doe willingly and
wittingly, ordinarily is in great da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger through

ſome great error and ruine of his ſoule; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
if hee were of any particular order of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by ſuch leauing of little cuſtoms and

his Order fenced in and defended with ſuch
cuſtoms as a gardin with a hedge. VVherfore,

that nouriſheth proper will, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

true performance of his profeſsion
then to abandon the good cuſtoms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of his Religion, which though they
be not the eſſentiall or verie ſubſtance throf,
yet are they the wall, trenche,<note place="margin">Similie.</note> or bulwarke
to defend the ſame? For as no Captaine of a
caſtle or Gouernour of a towne is ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
as to beat downe the walles or bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks,
or to fill vp the trenches or dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the ſame which defendeth the
towne, and maketh the enemy employ
his forces and ſpend his munition, ſhott,
and powder to win the ſame, and to beate
them downe before hee can aſſalt the caſtle
or towne it ſelfe: ſo is hee no wiſer who
beateth downe and aboliſheth ſuch ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and cuſtomes which keepe in ſafetie
the eſſentiall of his Rule (namely his three
vowes and other things commaunded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
paine of ſynne) and which make the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15475:36"/>
ſpirituall enemies to ſpend their forces in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning
the ſame before they can come to
that which is of greater conſequence. For, as
when ſuch defences of the towne be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
the enemy layeng his ſeige againſt it
forthwith planteth his Canons and beateth
at his will and pleaſure againſt the very how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the ſame euen vnto the heart therof,
and ſo it is in great danger to be taken and
ſubdued: in like manner when ſuch ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
be abrogated, the enemy beſeiging the
cittie of the ſoule, without any lett layeth on
his whole forces, and with his fierie arrowes
ſhooteth full butt againſt the naked eſſentiall
poynts and vndefe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vowes of his profeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
ſo that hee ought to be ſo far from ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of thoſe things, that though he were in
great ſublime contemplation, yet if hee knew
that ſuch things were to be done, hee ought
for the cauſes aboue ſaid to leaue the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But herein lieth the ſore and imperfection
in this caſe, that they thinke they ſhould be

done by euery part and ſence of the body or

                  <p>Note alſo, that though allwayes hee ought

eleuated as it may happen, eſpecially if hee be
diligent, and the worke be ſhorte and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue

hee may ſtill remaine vnited vnto him, vntill
hee take in hand ſome other thing. Likewiſe,
the worke being ſoone done, or els being
not diſtractiue, but rather drawing the ſoule
to deuotion and towards God, as in ſinging
hymnes or diuine ſeruice; a man may haue
his mind ſtill lifted vp, which if ſo it be, I
ſay not that hee direct a new his intention

inaſmuch as it appertaineth to mee, is
the verie <hi>vvill of God,</hi> and to mee is ſpirit and
life.</p>
                  <p>I ſay (the verie worke it ſelfe) to ſignifie
the thing done, and to exclude all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of any other thing, either in heauen, or
in earth, or in our ſoule, excepting as that
thing it ſelfe is in our ſoule. I ſay (both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
and ſpirituall) that none may think
the corporall to be leſſe then the ſpirituall;
and to touche the deceipt and common error
heerin of many ſpirituall men, which doe
more willingly the ſpirituall then the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
eſteeming the one kind more noble
then the other, and deeming to find more
life and light in the one then in the other;
which though it be true in reſpect only of
themſelfes, and good ſo to doe, preferring the
one before the other when a man hath liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to take his choiſe; yet is it otherwiſe when
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15475:45"/>
the <hi>vvill of God</hi> inter poſeth it ſelf by meanes
of any obligation or comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement; for then
it is ill done, and a man deceiueth himſelf in
preferring the ſpirituall before the corporall,
obedience being (as is ſaid) better then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.

be it corporall or ſpirituall ſubſtance togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alſo with all her Accidents, as the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

finally, all the qualities and accidents, as not
being this <hi>vvill of God,</hi> but as it appertaineth
vnto mee (that is) in as much as it ought to be

by the corporall powers and fiue ſences, <hi>Nihil

Thear is nothing in the vnderſtanding which
was not firſt of all in ſome of the fiue Sences;
which fiue Sences bring it into the three Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the ſoule, Intelligence, Memorie, and
VVill, which keepe, retaine, and (as it were)
digeſt, worke, and metamorphoſe the ſame
into another forme by taking away the vayle
therof, putting of the corporall Image; and ſo
bringing it to a pure abſtraction doth lodge
it in the eſſence of the ſoule: Thus (I ſay) the
worke is in our ſoule, and thus it appertaineth
vnto vs. Taking therfore the worke in this
forte, it is the verie <hi>vvill of God,</hi> and to him
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15475:45"/>
that ſo doth it ſpirit and life. For, though thear
be ſome darknes by reaſon of the Image or
imagination of the worke in my ſpirit, yet is
the ſame turned into light by the feruour and
light of this diuine will, wherby the ſoule
ſeeth, nor taſteth ought els but God and his
ſweet will and pleaſure: and how much more
willingly the worke is done in this order
(to weet) in not diuiding the worke and the
will, but eſteeming the verie worke to be the
verie will, ſo much the more cleerly doth the
ſoule ſee this will, and perfectly enioy God;
the worke that ſeemed corporall being ſo
turned wholie into ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>And note, that when I ſay one muſt not
looke on the <hi>vvill of God</hi> but on the worke,
my meaning is (as I haue ſaid) that hee ought
not to looke or behold the will a parte, as it
is not; but as one and the ſelf ſame thing with
the worke, as it is; nor that hee ſhould turne
his ſpirit and affection from the worke, but
contrariewiſe fix it ſtill in the ſame, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
as in his will.</p>
                  <p>VVhear is to be noted, that as ſome are in
this extremitie to turne their mind from the
worke, and fix it on the <hi>vvill of God;</hi> ſo are
they in farre greater number which leane to
the contrarie, turning their mind from the
<hi>vvill of God</hi> to fix it on the worke; ſo that as
the one (which be ſpirituall) find not the
<hi>vvill of God</hi> becauſe they ſeeke it not in his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15475:46"/>
worke; ſo the others (which are the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and vndeuout) doe not the worke of
God, becauſe they ſeeke it not in his will: for,
as wee doe but lie to God and in vayne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
our ſelfes, in thinking to loue his will and
yet neglect his worke; ſo doe wee no leſſe,
when wee thinke to doe his worke and yet
neglect his will.</p>
                  <p>It is therfore euident, that to vnite both
theſe extremities, and amend theſe twoe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
imperfections, the <hi>vvill of God</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the aboue ſaid Maxime) muſt be
ioyned with his worke, and his worke with
his will, and neuer make them twoe, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
one and the ſelf ſame thing; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that the accompliſhing of the worke
is his verie will, and that his will is the verie
accompliſhing of the worke, though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of this latter imperfection of doing
the worke without hauing regard to the <hi>vvill

becauſe in this poynt they often intrude

the cauſes wherof they ſpring.</p>
                  <p>The firſt cauſe then,<note place="margin">The first cauſe.</note> wherof theſe doubts
doe ſpring, is becauſe in matters indifferent
a man knoweth not whether hee hath choſen
that ſide which pleaſeth God or nor, in doing

becauſe forgetting his rule hee knoweth
not how to diſcerne the matter, taking

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
whether it be more agreable to God
to leaue or doe it, to doe this or to doe that.</p>
                  <p>For remedy therfore heerof,<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> hee muſt kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
that this is not the meanes in things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
but muſt iudge therof by an interior
diſcuſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not by the exterior thing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by a view or examen of the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion; which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15475:47"/>
if it tend directly to the <hi>vvill of God,</hi> hee hath
in veritie choſen that which is his will; becauſe
in ſuch indifferent things the worke fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the intention, and not the intention
the worke.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond doubt is in little matters,<note place="margin">2. Cauſe.</note> and
proceeds from the ſmallnes and little valew
therof, perſwading ſome that God eſteemeth
not ſuch things, ſayeng (as it were) in them
ſelfes: God careth much for this or that; or,
hath God need, or maketh hee accompt of
theſe ſmalle things?</p>
                  <p>The remedie wherof is,<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> to remember that
as wee muſt not ſerue God only with a parte
but with all our forces, ſo muſt wee not only
doe ſome of our actions but all for him; and
therfore the little aſwell as the great. Alſo, that
God meaſureth the goodneſſe of the worke,
not by the exterior valew but by the inward
intention, and a little thing in our eyes may
be great before God:<note place="margin">Simlie.</note> For, like as the garment
of ruſſet embroadred with gold and ſett
with perles, is richer then that of veluet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ornament; the cloake lined with vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet
is more coſtly then one of taffata lined
with ſearge; ſo the leaſt worke exterior with
perfect intention, is better then the greateſt
with an imperfect intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Finally, the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of this doubt is, to remember to what the
Apoſtle exhorteth vs ſayeng,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Omne quodcunque

                  <p>The third kinde of things wherof theſe

things pleaſant and ſenſuall, as eating, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,

ſyncerely, but rather faine, and mocke (as it
were) God, in ſayeng they doe them for his
only will and to pleaſe him, feeling that it
pleaſeth theyr nature and ſenſualitie: which
error proceedeth from the euill cuſtome
wherunto a man hath giuen himſelf, to doe
ſuch things only by the motion, tract, and
impulſion of pleaſure and ſenſualitie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intention or regard had to the <hi>vvill of

God allmightie, infinite, and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

the will by loue proportioneth it ſelf in ſome

him (as it were) to deſcend vnto vs; but
the loue of the VVill maketh man like vnto

this ſpeculation of the Intelligence is a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
thing, making vs remaine in our ſelfes;
but the affection of the VVill is a druine thing,
eleuating and drawing vs out of our ſelfes to
be transformed into God. And therfore it is
cleere that ſuch ſpeculations and diſcourſes
of the Intelligence, are not perfection no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The difference betwixt the Interiour and

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the other by Interiour things,
as inſpirations, illuminations, eleuations, and

ſhaddowed with corporall things or by theyr
images, and the other is wholly diſcouered in
ſpirit and truth; the one hath in it acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

eſſentiall; the one conſiſteth of the ryne
and pith (to weet) both of the Exteriour and
interiour, but the other of the interiour only.
All which notwithſtanding is meant accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our capacitie, (to weet) that the will
diuine is different, which in it ſelf is alwayes
but one and the ſame, as wee haue ſhewn in
the beginning of the firſt parte, Chap. 4. but
that our capacitie apprehendeth it ſo; and that
in ſuch maner, and by ſuch degrees it diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
and manifeſteth it ſelf vnto vs, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

a great many, yet for breuitie I will reduce

and ſimple regard of the <hi>vvill of God</hi> (that
is) when in our worke, affection, or paſsion,
wee caſt our thought and ſpirituall ſight on

ſerenely, and without all maner of ſtreſſe or

now, by how much more quietly, ſimply, and

ſee and taſt this diuine will; and alſo ſo much
the ſooner ſhall our ſpirit be ſimplyfied, by

geueth her ſo true knowledge of God, that

paſſe in effect and ſubſtance within the ſowlle
in this her deſire of Humiliation; the which
ſpirituall effect a man cannot expreſſe but by
ſuch articulate words. And thus by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Humiliation ought the ſowlle learne
to humble herſelf amid the familiar viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and blandiſhments of her heauenly
ſpouſe (that is to ſay) behaue her with as
profownd reuerence toward that great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
as it daigneth to ſtoope in ſo great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie
to her; and ought to take great heed
not to render herſelf reciprocally familiar
vnto him as to her equall, for ſo ſhould ſhee
make of this familiaritie a wall betwixt God
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15475:87"/>
and her, and a very thick clowd which would
hinder her from the cleer aſpect of the ſpouſe,
and from wading forward into his greatneſſe;
a poynt wherin many ſpirituall perſons doe
very much preiudice themſelfes, forgetting
through Gods great familiaritie with them,
to render vnto him a due and profownd
reuerence.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why ſuch familiaritie of the
ſowlle toward God is ſuch an obſtacle and
clowd,<note place="margin">VVhy fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity maketh a vvall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvixt God and the Souls</note> is becauſe that therby ſhee accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the greatneſſe of God to her ſmallneſſe,
and his diuinitie to her humanitie, and ſo
ſeeth allmoſt nothing at all out of her ſelf, nor
any greatneſſe aboue her owne; wheras by
profownd reuerence ſhee is rayſed vp aboue
her ſelf to the greatnes of God, and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth
herſelf in ſome ſort to him, and her
humanitie to his Dietie, and ſo ſhee ſeeth
things which are aboue her; in the one God
is proportionated to the ſowlle, in the other
the ſowlle to God; in the one God is abaſed
without that the ſowlle is any whit lifted vp,
in the other the ſowlle is lifted vp, without
that God is any whit abaſed: And ſo yow ſee

being but an exceſſiue ſpirituall ioy, the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
abundance wherof repleniſheth wholly
the ſowlle, and with her extreame ſweetnes
ſo inebriateth her, as that cleane forgetting
the world and all creatures, yea her ſelf, ſhee
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:15475:90"/>
remaineth wholly fixed in this fountaine of
ioye (to weet) God, whoe hath totally ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
vpon all her powres, and ſo ſtrooken and
wownded her heart, and taken a full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
therof, that ſhee hauing now no more
dominion ouer herſelf, followeth his infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
inſtincts and attractions all in all, and
(as it were) hand in hand, geueth eare to his

geueth herſelf wholly ouer vnto him, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
and ſubiecting her to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
followeth him like as doth the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
the boddie, adheareth to him like the
Accident to the Subſtance, like the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

the ſame ſpirit with God,<note place="margin">Corin. 6.</note> for, <hi>Qui adhaeret Deo,

is one ſpirit with him.</p>
                  <p>Thus then it appeareth how the Interiour
<hi>vvill of God</hi> cometh not all at once but by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, and how the ſowlle feeleth it by

all ouer with the darkneſſe of the night, and it
on the other ſide like vnto the Sun or day,<note place="margin">Similie notan.</note>

are aſſured by the diuine powre and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

theron, and that, by way of Reſignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But
as this fowdation is not alwayes ſenſible, but
often hath reſidence only in the Reaſon, ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe
ſome tymes a man can not haue this
Reſignation ſenſible; but only the reaſonable;
the which hee may alwayes haue, euen when
the ſenſe is quite contrarie to the Reſignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;

take as the <hi>vvill of God</hi> this Irreſignation; and
if yet the darkenes be ſo great that hee can
not thus doe, hee muſt alſo reſigne his darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
if (finally) by reaſon of tediouſneſſe
hee hath not the will to performe any of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
things, hee muſt offer to God this tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and defect of good will, and take it at his
hands as his will in this maner, reducing to
Reſignation the letts of Reſignation which
may occurre; to the end that in this ſort, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
and inceſſantly the <hi>vvill of God</hi> may (as
is aboue ſayd) deuoure all things, and that a
man may dwell allwayes therin: and this kind

AN ANSVVER TO A
doubt touching the Obiect of the vvill
of God.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR Brother; this preſent ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
for your ſatisfaction, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
yow touching a certaine
doubt which yow fownd in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the exerciſe of the <hi>vvill of God.</hi> And as
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that which yow ſay; firſt, that thear
is great difference betwixt God and his will;
for my part I acknowledge no ſuch: For, I
think that hee which ſeeth this eſſentiall will
(to weet) conſidered only in God, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
hath ſeen God, and that as one and
the ſame thing, not as diuerſe; for in God
thear is nothing but God. And touching this
point and the elucidation therof, thear is nere
a whole chapter in the third part, whear thear
are not too many arguments which proue it,
and too many Doctours thear alleaged which
with one conſent affirme not the ſame: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which alſo, I haue had heertofore the
aduiſe of ſome Diuines, though the thing be
of it ſelf too cleer, and likewiſe the Method
ſayth the ſame. But I ſee your error heerin
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:15475:98"/>
proceedeth from this cauſe (to weet) that
yow haue not well marked how I haue diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it into three ſorts of wills, yow hauing no
reſpect to the difference therof; not that in it
ſelf, but in vs it is diſtinguiſhed. Now, yow
notwithſtanding write to mee of the <hi>vvill of
God</hi> in generall, not expreſsing which of the
3. yow ſpeake of. And it is no marueil if yow
know not the ſublimitie, and nuditie which I
attribute to the eſſetiall <hi>vvill of God,</hi> ſeing yow
haue not read what I haue written therof; and
therfore yow ought not to condemne a thing
which yow neuer haue but halfe ſeen. For,
whoe ſo hath read the third part, I doubt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will reprehend the contrarie fault (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely)
that it is too naked, abſtract, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
and nothing els but God.</p>
            <p>Now, yow alleage that this exerciſe admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
ſome Obiect, wherof is no particular one
in God. To which I anſwer, that this word
(Obiect) may be vnderſtood twoe maner
of wayes; for a generall, or for a particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.
As concerning the generall which is God
himſelf, I anſwer that the third or ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
will admitteth alſo no other but him,
though not ſo in the firſt and ſecond part,
whear thear is ſome particular obiect which
to the Beginners ſeemeth to cauſe ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt God and this VVill; but it
is becauſe that at the firſt this diuine will ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
it ſelf as exteriour, and then after as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:15475:99"/>
and finally, as eſſentiall; not that in it
ſelf it is variable or different, for that cometh
of our part whoe ſo doe contemplate it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
to our light which is ſmall, and
not wholy abſtract from an obiect in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
life. Now, this light is greater in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue
life, and moſt great in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
whear this will is ſeen to be God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
which appeareth more plaine by the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
which followeth.</p>
            <p>Yow muſt knowe then,<note place="margin">Similie notan.</note> that this exterior
will is like a riuer which runneth into the ſea,
for ſo doth this will carrie our ſoule to God:
and as the riuer-water is not called the ſea
though it be the ſame water, ſo this exterior
will is not properly called God though it be
but one and the ſame ſpirit; and as the limits
only, and not the ſubſtance cauſeth it to be
called a Riuer and not the Sea, ſo the limits of
this will, and not the ſubſtance giueth it the
name of VVill, and not of God; and as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of the riuer haue not their Originall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the ſame, ſo the limits of this will proceed not
therof but from our darknes; and as, if thear
were no land wee ſhould ſee no riuer but all
ſea, becauſe thear would be no limit, ſo if thear
were in vs no clowd of darknes, wee ſhould
ſee no more this will as ſuch, but only God, as
is declared in the ninth Chapter of the 3. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te:
And as the ſhipp in this riuer being not
hindred, neceſſarily is tranſported by the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:15475:99"/>
ſtreame therof into the ſea, ſo the ſoule ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no impediment, is caried by the courſe
of this will vnto the naked Eſſence of God;
and as when one is ſo led into the maine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
hee ſeeth no more the riuer (though the
ſame in ſubſtance) but the ſea, ſo hee which is
tranſported into the eſſentiall will, ſeeth no
more this (as ſuch) but God only.</p>
            <p>Yf yow demand why in the beginning a
man taketh not God for the Object of this
exerciſe without this <hi>vvill,</hi> I aske why doth
not one leape ouer the ſtile before hee come
at it? or why the ſhip which is at <hi>Roan</hi> doth
not ride in the ſea at <hi>Nevvhauen,</hi> rather then
in the riuer of <hi>Roan?</hi> If yow ſay becauſe it is
at <hi>Roan</hi> and not at <hi>Nevvhuaen,</hi> I anſwer the
like; that the Beginners are not in this ample
and ſpatious eſſentiall ſea of God, but in this
riuer of his <hi>vvill</hi> which will leade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therto.
And I hold it a point of great indiſcretion to
ſet a little bote on the maine ſea, and a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the naked Ocean of the diuine eſſence.
Yow may ſee therfore, why at the beginning
I haue not denudated this exerciſe of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect:
yow may alſo perceiue in ſome ſort that
it was the only, perfect, ſuccinct point, and
that which bringeth moſt light, which I could
chooſe wherinto compendiouſly to reduce
the whole ſpirituall life, without euer leauing
it of, or ſeeking others, no leſſe then the ſhip
which to goe into the ſea, neuer leaueth the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:15475:100"/>
riuer wherin ſhee rideth. In the beginning I
only call it <hi>vvill</hi> and not <hi>God,</hi> becauſe one of
theſe twoe words fitteth better the Actiue life
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, becauſe more properly wee ſay
in the Actiue life; I will doe this thing becauſe
it is the <hi>vvill of God,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſay, becauſe it is <hi>God:</hi>
alſo that would be too ſublime a doctrine, and
(litterally taken) ſcarſe to be admitted: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
becauſe all exerciſes, wayes, vertues, and
perfections, are better reduced to this, then
to any other point. In the Contemplatiue
life alſo or ſecond part, I doe not take this
word <hi>God,</hi> becauſe thear is yet ſome image
though verie ſubtile and ſecret. Finally, in the
Supereminent life or third part, I doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this word <hi>vvill,</hi> fearing leaſt a man might
think that I had cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged the point or obiect of
this exerciſe; but I keep allwayes the ſame
word, keeping ſtill the diſtinction of three
Epithets (to weet) <hi>Exteriour,</hi> for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue
life; <hi>Interiour,</hi> for the Contemplatiue,
and <hi>Eſſentiall,</hi> for the <hi>Supereminent;</hi> VVhich
muſt be noted for auoyding in this exerciſe
both error and confuſion. And thus much for
the reſolution of your doubt.</p>
