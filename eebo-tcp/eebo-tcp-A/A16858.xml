         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

whan he sold his clothys for a resonable

it be a fewe, which be inordinate rich,
and eate owt their neyhbors, thei wil also say
yea, and that thei gayned more in one pack,
than thei do now in thre. And as for the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
spynner and carder, though thei haue a litle
more for their paynes, thei pay doble so moch
for all things that goo both to back and belly,
and scant can get an howse to put in their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys,
or at least not able to furnyssh it for their

is the inordinate raysing of rentys. It is vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

Well than, I say vnto the my lord parson &amp;

sheefe, the tenth lambe, goose, flese, and so of

neyther preach, teach, nor doo any offyce of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

parson or of a vicar, but polle &amp; pylle. What
canst thou say for thy selfe my lord parson and
vicar? Thow wilt say parauenture, the kyng
gaue me the abbey and all that longeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
which had them geuen hym be the parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Therfor if thou speake against my being
person &amp; vicar, though I neyther preach nor
teach, nor yet procure none to do it for me,
thou art a traytor: for this is the .xiij. artycle
of our crede added of late, that what so euer
the parlament doth, must nedys be well done,
and the parlament or any proclamacyon ow<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of the parlament tyme, cannot erre. Therfor
let no man be so hardy in payne of death, to
speake or complayne, for the redresse of any
thing that is done amysse, eyther by the parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or by any proclamacyon. If this be so my
lord parson, than haue ye brought Rome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to your own dores, &amp; geuen the auctory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
to the kyng and the parlament, that the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
bisshops gaue vnto the pope: which was
this: Si papa &amp;ce. If the pope thorow his faut
shuld send infinyte thousandes to the deuyl,
<pb facs="tcp:6937:30"/>
yet must no man speake agaynst him. And if ye
haue geuyn the same auctoryte vnto the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament
that the papistes gaue to their general
councels, that is, that thei can not erre, and
what so euer is onys determyned in a general
councel, must nedys be true, and of no lesse au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoryte,
than the gospel: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f this be so, it is all in
vayne to loke for any amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of any thing.
And we be in as euyl case, as whan we were
vnder the bisshop of Rome, if we haue all the
lawes of hym co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fyrmed with fyre and death.
Surely the popissh bisshops, whan thei were
robbed of the pope of Rome, thei wold nedys
haue a pope: and therfor thei wold haue made
the kyng their pope, and thei gaue hym aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte
to doo all things in England, that the pope
dyd in Rome, as to forbyd maryage certen ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
in the yeare, and than to sell lycencys for
the same, to selle lycence to eate flessh in lent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
non residencys, and such other. And euen the
popys proctor sayd (as it was told me) that he
might make sayntes also. And lesse there shuld
want any thing to a perfyght pope dome, the
<pb facs="tcp:6937:31"/>
bisshops caused a proclamacyon to be set out
in the kyngs name, that from hense forth the ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>remonyes
of the church, that were of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pys
makyng, shuld no more be taken for the
popys ceremonys, but the kyngs, and so thei
made the kyng father to the popys childern.
But I am sure, though the bisshops wold make
the kyng pope, he wold not take it vpon hym.
And I trust, that euery day more and more his
grace shal spye their popissh intentys. But to
yow my lord personys, how can ye defend
your seluys, if a man shuld bring this argument
agaynst you, and proue you all theuys, that
haue personages and vicarages in your han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and can not preach. Christ sayeth Iohn
the .x. he that entreth not in to the shepefold
by the dore, but clymeth in another way, is a
thefe and a murderer: but ye entred in another
way, wherfore ye are theuys and murderers.
That ye come not in by the dore, I wil proue
it thus: Christ is the dore, but by Christ ye ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
not in to the shepe fold, that is to say, to be
parsons and vicars, for ye grant, that ye came
<pb facs="tcp:6937:31"/>
in by the act of parlament, and the act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament
is not Christ, for it is not confirmed by
christes word, therfor ye came not by christ,
and so be ye theuys and murderers: as your
workes prouyd of late, in shedding of the blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of so many true prechers and shepardes,
which spent their lyues for their shepe. If this
argument be not strong inough, what say ye
by this? All they that come before me (sayth
Christ) are theuys and robbers, ye come in to
the shepefold before Christ, ergo ye be the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uys
and robbars. To come in before Christ, is
to be a parson or a vicar before Christ send
hym: And ye came in before Christ sent yow,
for he sendeth none to be shepardes, but such
as he knoweth to be able to fede his flocke, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
he neuer sent yow: for he knoweth yow
vnable to doo that office. And thus to conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
ye be theues and robbers, for a thefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not but to steale and to kyll. Wherfor
gyue ouer your personages to learned men, &amp;

mynysters of his word, no other reward in

poore wretchys (but out castes, in the sight of
the world, as. s. Paul sayth) he hath wrought
this, that where as the kyng was before but a
shadow of a kyng, or at the most but halfe a
king, now he doth wholly raygne thorow
<pb facs="tcp:6937:49"/>
their preaching, wryting and suffryng. But

to abhorre the name of the pope for a face, and
compel them to walk in all his wicked lawys.
And the word of god which we say we haue

of the bysshops, and thou shalt manyfest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the holy goost, as is lyght agaynst darcknes.
First the scripture teacheth one god only thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the byble, and the apostles refused to be
worshipped, as the .xiiij. chapter of the actes
of the apostels doth manifestly declare, where
Pawl and Barnabas rent their clothys, cryeng
vnto the peple: Why do ye thys? we be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

the .xxij. with dyuerse other testymo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyes,
as the .xx. of Exody, the Psal. lxvi. and

thorow the scripture, &amp; hated of god, which
commandeth us, that we shuld not ones bowe
vnto them, Exodi. the .iiij. and .xx. Leuiticus

and the maker theroff, sayng, the sekyng of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

dowt not, but if thou beleuyst in god, thow
wylt not worship nor knele afore an image,
for all the goodys in the world. But now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to thys doctryne, our forkyd chanany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
the pompos bisshops teach us to worship
many goddys. If any man aske me how I pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue

hold those holy dayes, but only to honore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as goddes? do thei not make men to fast their
euyns as though thei were goddes? do thei not
teach us to pray to them, and to crye to them
for helpe? Come to the labor of a woman that

And whan we offend our neyhbers and
brethern, we may not only confesse vs vnto
the lord, but also vnto them whom we haue

Christ teacheth us in the .v. of Mathew, and
Iames also in the .v. chapter of his epistle. This

that thei may sytt in the conscyence of men,

not redargyng the repentance of the hart,

than a bussard. Oh ye blasphemers,
what grownd haue ye to stablyssh your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rycular

that place, where as Chryst sent the lepers
vnto the pryst, luke the .xvij. which maketh
as moch for that purpose, as to lay an vnyon
to my lytel fyngar for the tothe ache. For
Christ sent them to the prystes, only to offer
<pb facs="tcp:6937:55"/>
an oblacyon after the lawe, and that the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
myght se, that thei were whole, and so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

exspyred and than thei being fownd whole,
the prystes myght admytte them to come in to
the company of the whole peple agayne.
Reade the .xiij. and .xiiij. of Leuiticus, and
thow shalt perceyue the same. Christ healyd
the people of dyuerse other diseasys as of the
palsy, blody flyxe, possessed with deuyls and
such other, yet he neuer sent none to the
prystes, but the lepers only: which he dyd,
bycause it was so appoynted of god in Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
lawe.</p>
               <p>Item Chryst teacheth us, how we shuld
pray, not with moch bablyng, as the hethyn
doo, thinkyng to be heard for their moch bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
sake. Mathew the .vi. (yet ought the

               <p>Item the scripture teacheth what true fast
is, and how to fast, in the .lviij. of Esay, that is
to say, to lett them out of bondage which be in
danger: to breake the oth of wicked bergans:
to let the oppressed goo fre: to deale thy bread
to the hungry, to bring the poore fatherles to
thy house, to couer the naked &amp;ce. For soch
fast, Christ offeryth us the kingdome of his fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,
Mathew .xxv. Which teacheth us also,
that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we fast, we shuld not fast to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

But our belly goddes teach, yea command us
a contrary fast, appoynting us dayes to abstey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
from flessh. To the which fast, not only the
strong, lusty, and helthy parson is bownd, but
also the sycke, poore and nedy, which hath
scant nature to beare the body. And though he
<pb facs="tcp:6937:57"/>
hath not eatyn a good meale in .viij dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet must he fast their appoynted dayes.
And that not only to the honor of god, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
for the honor of the sayntes, his creaturys
yea and some also for the honor of the pope as

a miserable thing? No man denyeth this, that
if any man fele his flessh prone and ready to

from meates, not only flessh, but all other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
that may prouoke him to any concupisce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
vntyl he hath mortifyed his flessh, and made it
subiect and obedyent vnto the spiryte: But this
must not be done onely on the fryday or vpon
certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appoynted dayes, but euery day thorout
his life, whan so euer he shal fele his flessh so
enclyned and bent. And this fast shal be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
to swage the ragyng of his flessh. And
it is good to be vsed of syngle parsons, and of
such as be absent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their yockfelows, &amp; pry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cked
to fylthynes. And this is the fast, which
S. Paul speaketh of vnto the Colossyans: Mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyfye
your membres vpon erth, &amp;c. but to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are bownd to forbeare or abstey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

doctryne, as. S. Paul witnesseth. i. Tymot .iiij.</p>
               <p>Item Christ sayd vnto his apostles, which
were bisshops of his church, that thei shuld be
<pb facs="tcp:6937:58"/>
seruantes and mynisters, and not Idols as ours
be, saing: The kinges and lordes of the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyles
raygne ouer them, and thei are called gracios
lordes, but ye shal not be so: but he that wil be
grettest among yow, shal be your mynister:
and he that wil be chefe, shal be seruant vnto
all. For the son of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came not to be ministred
vnto, but to minister vnto other. And agayne:
christ sayth, that foxes haue holes, &amp; the bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the ayer haue nestys, but the son of man
hath not where to rest his head. Soch possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onars
were the bysshops of the primatyue
church. Now ye may ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly se, that our lordly
apostateys fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> christ, be nothing lesse than mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
or Euangelical bisshops. For thei be ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sters,
gouernors, rulers, lordes, yea and most
greatest lordes. And thei wil be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myssyonars
in maner in euery te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral matter. And thei be
also of prynces and kynges councels, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassytors
for princes. But woo is vnto that cy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te,
town, contry or reame, where thei rule in
councel. And come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly it spedeth vnhappyly to
that reame, where thei be embassytors, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb facs="tcp:6937:58"/>
lesse, or els thei fayle of their purpose, as some
dyd with in these .ij. yerys, thanckys be vnto
god only therfor. And where as christ had not
where in to hyde his heade, how contrary be
thei vnto hym and to his apostels also, whose
successors thei wil be called, whan thei be not
thing lesse. What lordes haue more gorgyos
houses than thei haue? yea fewe lordes lyke
them. What a cockatryse syght was it, to se
such an abhomynable sort of pompos bisshops
in lordly parlament robys, as went before the

where such a sort of vypers be? And specially
where thei beare such a swynge, as Wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester
doth, to whom the grettest nomber of
the bisshops do leane? How blynd be the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

pyedly goo thei lyke mommers, disgysed from

knyghtes, and men of lawe, that thei may
defend their popissh kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Paul sayth: Apte
to teach, but thei beate, &amp; teach nothing: And
if thei teach any thing, what teach thei? euen
that Paul writeth of vnto Tymothe the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne
of the dyuel: makyng the word of god
of none effect thorow their tradycyons. Paul
sayth: Not geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fylthy lucre. But where be

of luke: who so euer beareth not his crosse
dayly, can not be my disciple. And for this cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se.
S. Paul reioyseth so oft in his pistels, of that
crosse, which he receyuyd for the gospels sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
in the second to the Cory<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But our forked and open Idolators teach
no such crosse, but because Christ suffred do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath
vpon a crosse (which is rotten many yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
a goo) thei wil haue men to worship all
crossys, which be but synylytudes of the cros<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se

Idolatry. Oh lord, how hast thow plaged
the world for Idolatry and adultery? which
our bisshops can not se, because thei can not
sprytually perceyue aryght, the benefyte that
we receyued only in Christes blode thorow
his passyon. But thei must haue a crosse of syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
and gold borne before them, which thei
worship: for thei must se with their corporal
eye, that which thei worship. But what sayth
the scripture? who hath sene the symylytude
of god at anytyme? Thei wyl not beare that
crosse of Christ, that Paul speaketh of, the vi.
to the Galathyans, but thei wil crucifye vnto
death all those which wold beare that crosse.
Now most deare christyans, and specyally ye
burgessys of the parlament, here I haue brefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touched certen thinges, how and what the
holy scripture teacheth thorow the holy gost,
spoken and wrytten by his prophetys, Euange<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>listes and apostels, yea &amp; by his deare son also
our only and ful redemer Iesus Chryst. Also
I haue touched as brefely as I can, certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things
how and what our bisshops teach, whose do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne
is as directly agaynst the scripture of
<pb facs="tcp:6937:60"/>
god, as antichrist may be agaynst Christ. And
as thei agree in these fewe things, so do thei in
all other. Serch the scripture, and thou shalt as
easely knowe the enemies therof, as thou maist
know a foxe by his furred tayle. How ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god
and mammon agre? no more surely can the po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos
bisshops agree with the scripturys, becau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
it bewrayth them. It calleth them rauening
wolues in shepys clothyng, Mathew the .vij.
Eze .xxij. Zophoni .iij. And do not their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes
in all poyntes agree with wolues? for as
lytle pytye haue the bisshops vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a right pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acher,
writer or professor of the gospel, as
hath a wolfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a lambe in his hongar. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
be examples inowe in our dayes, how thei
haue constrayned certen men to recant. And
where as the holy gost sayth, that thei shal co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me
in shepys clothing, do not thei come vnder
the color of gods word, to confound both the
word &amp; christ therto as moch as lythe in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
I wold fayne axe a questyon, whether those
that persecute, or those which are persecuted,
be more lyke wolues? Thow seist, that those
which he persecuted, are very pore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the
<pb facs="tcp:6937:61"/>
sight of the world (although thei be riche in
god) And neyther thei nor none of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne
neuer persecuted man vnto death, Thei
haue no rule, no pour, no toth, no horne, no
sword, no lawe as bisshops haue. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyd
persecutors haue vnreasonable riches, &amp;
pour of the sword &amp;ce. in their handys: The
pore sort seke the blode of no man, but are con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent
to spend their own blode, to call all men
vnto christ by his word, with the losse of
their lyues. Wherfor if thou be not wilfully
blynd, and a membre of antychrist, thou maist
easyly se and perceyue, whych be wolues &amp;
which lammes. The scripture callyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also
dragons, lyons, Beares &amp; such other names as
in the .vij. of Daniel, Prouer .xxvij. Ezech
.xxij. and in dyuerse other places, and all for
their cruelnes and other correspondent qualy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teys,
which I wil no further prosecute at this

NOw to touch the conclusyon of this my
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playnte, the effect (as ye may percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue)
is this, that the body of this reame, I meane
the comynaltye, is so oppressed and oueryoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
as fewe reamys vnder the sonne be by wi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cked
lawes, cruel tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, which be extorcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nars
and oppresors of the common welth. For
all men are geuen to seke their own pryuate
welth only, &amp; the pore are nothing prouyded
for. We remayne also and contynue styl in a
perpetual bondage and spiritual captiuyte, for
as moch as we walke in all the wicked lawes,
most fylthy tradicyons, and beggarly ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
of Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Rome I meane, which the bis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shops
of the reame (the deare children of their

of death to obserue, by force of their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
riches &amp; vnlauful auctorite. All which
abuses here in mencyoned &amp; innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which I can not, neyther is it possible for
me to remember, for the loue that ye ought to
haue vnto god, and for the hope that ye ought
to haue in the merytes of christes blode, all ye
lordes, knightes and burgessys seke, seke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
<pb facs="tcp:6937:62"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, And let all things be reformed, and
set forth by the soch stone, which is godds
word. So that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hense forth the glory of god
may be sought in all thinges, as ye haue in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
past sought the glory of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And where as
ye haue sought euery man his own pryuate or
partycular welth, now seke your neyhbors
welth as your own. And where as ye haue
bestowed moch ryches vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead, &amp; clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
stockes and stones, Now bestow it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the lyuyng poore sayntes, which be the image
of god as the scripture teacheth. And let all
thinges be done of Zeale only for gods truthes
sake. And thus ye shal please god, &amp; cause him
of his mere mercy to withdrawe his wrath,
yea rather his iustyce from us, that is to say in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
plages ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gyng ouer our headys &amp;
be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t agaynst us, which we haue rightfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
for castyng a syde gods word, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowyng
our own Imagynacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But in case ye
wil not so doo, nor harken to reforme the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysses,
seing god hath so many wayes war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
yow (as by his mynisters, preachers and
wrytars) but wil styll playe the cananytes &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:6937:62"/>
tyrannys, no dowt euyn as god is god, so loke
for some of the plagys of Egypt, which he wil
sodenly send vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yow, whan ye thinck least
vpon them. Yea all the examples of the bible
declare, that without diligent reformacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;
profound repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the reame of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
all other reamys vnder the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne hath most
rightfully deseruyd to be plaged, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
shortly. For why? at this day the extorcyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and cruelnes of the temporal rulars is so come
to pas, that in maner euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
a very Nero. And the yockes of the lawe
be so heuy, that no faythful christen man is able
to beare them. As for adultery and Idolatry,
which euer stanck in the syght of god, I thinck
there was neuer reame vnder the sonne might
so well be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to the land of Sodome and

to declare the lykelyhode of your ponysshme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
how hath the word of god bene prechyd and
set forth by wrytars? so syncerely, and so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owndantly,
as neuer was more in any reame.
And the mynisters of god in that offyce haue
bene so suttylly persecuted, &amp; so cruelly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb facs="tcp:6937:63"/>
as was neuer more in city nor reame, no
not in Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is reproued in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for killyng of the prophetys. And all the
examples of the bible declare, that where the
word of god goth before, &amp; is not receyued,
nor no amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of lyfe folowyng therupon,
the plages of god folowed euer more.</p>
               <p>Agayne: another lykelyhode that ye shal
not escape your rightful ponisshment; is this.
Many yeares past what tranquillyte hath this
reame bene in? And what troubles of late hath
god so fatherly pacifyed? That we might euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
se, that it was his worke, and no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys.
And all to haue brought vs vnto repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce.
Agayne, what plenty of corne and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of other thinges haue we had these fewe
years past? so that all thinges had bene at a
wonderos lowe price, as I think was neuer se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
in Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but only for that that rent ys be so
enha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed. Mark this, &amp; ye shal perceyue, how
Ioyntly this agreith with the. vij. fat oxen,
which betokened a tyme of plenty, but loke
what folowed? vij. leane oxen, Genesis. xli.
Wherfor as is sayd, these things be surely be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:6937:63"/>
agaynst us, and must of necessyte come vpon
the reame, onlesse god turne his Iustyce in to
mercy. But I aduyse the o Ingland, presume not
thow there vpon, and say not, but thow art
warned. Wherfor a wake from thy slepe,
that thy blode come not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thyne oune head.
The euerliuyng god, who of his Iustyce most
rightuosly plaged Hierusalem, and of his most
fauorable and aboundant grace shewyd mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
vnto the cyty of Bethula, that most mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
god, grant vnto the peple of Ingland such
lyke repentance as had the Ninyuytes, and to
bring forth the frutes of the same, turning from
their wicked wayes, as the Niniuytes dyd. If
thow so wilt, oh mercyful lord god, so be it.
The grace of our lord Iesus Christ, the loue of
god, and the felowship of the holy goost be
with yow all: wherby ye may turne from all
your abhomynacyons, to the euerliuyng god.
So be it, so be it.</p>
