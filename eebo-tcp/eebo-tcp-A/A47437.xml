         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Jacob</hi> was like to meet with great Trouble, being forc'd to fly for fear of his Life; (<hi>Esau</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged against him, first for getting his <hi>Birth-right</hi>; and now also his Blessing.) God no doubt gave him this Dream to succour and comfort him in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and not only so, but to discover a greater Good to him than his present Support; even to make known by this Dream, the <hi>Messiah</hi> that should proceed from his Loyns, by whom he, and all his true Seed should ascend to Heaven, and be with God for ever.</p>
               <p>In my Text are Two Things to be noted.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="1">1. Because they arise immediately from God's Spirit; it is the divine Spirit that Injects those Thoughts into our Hearts whilst we Sleep.</p>

                  <q>God sends Dreams to <hi>instruct</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form:</hi> There are teaching Dreams, as that of <hi>Joseph</hi> was, not only to shew him what to do about <hi>Mary</hi> his espoused Wife, but to instruct him about the great Mystery of God manifested in the Flesh, to save lost Man.</q>

               </p>
               <p>There are some who affirm that a Man is never in a sound, or deep Sleep when he <hi>Dreameth</hi>; which certainly is a great mistake:<note place="margin">Gen. 15.12.</note> For doth not the Text say, <hi>That a deep Sleep fell on</hi> Abraham when God by a <hi>Dream</hi> revealed to him what should become of his Posterity, and how they should be in <hi>Egypt</hi> Four Hundred Years.</p>
               <p>I find that Divines give several Reasons why God used to apply himself to Man by Dreams; or this way speaketh to him: Of which Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> gives five Reasons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because in Sleep, Man is (as I may say) at best leisure for God to deal with him; he is not so busy nor distracted,<note place="margin">See Caryl on Iob, cap. 13.</note> or hurried with the Affairs of this Life: Some Men are so fill'd with earthly thoughts whilst awake, that they have no time, no leisure to hear what God hath either by his Word, or by Conscience to say unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because when they are awake, they are ready to debate and discuss what they receive by their own Reason, we are subject (as he observes) to <hi>Logick</hi> it with God, or use Arguments to avoid sharp Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions darted into the mind: But in Sleep we take things barely as offered, without Reasonings, or Disputings against it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because in Sleep, when all is still and quiet, that which God represents to us, takes more with the Soul, and leaves a deeper Impression upon the Mind of Man; for common experience teacheth us how Dreams, (and specially some) stick; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41018:7"/>
how those Apprehensions which we have in our Sleep dwell with us, and abide in our Memory, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake: Nay, perhaps some remarkable Dream we had Twenty, Thirty, nay, more than 40 years ago, are still fresh in our Minds, we finding it was of God and full of Instruction: As I could tell you of one I had when Young; a discovery to me of those great Troubles and Sorrows I should meet with, I thought I was with the Lord Jesus, and he gave me a touch, and bid me follow him; which I did, tho' I saw no form) and he spake to me, and told me, I should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hard things for his Sake; and soon after my Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als began, which were known to many, tho' this was between 30 and 40 years ago, yet is as fresh in my Memory as if not above a Year since.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because the Lord hereby would clearly shew his Divine Skill in Teaching and Instructing Man; or that he hath a peculiar way or art in Teaching: He Teacheth so as none of the Wise Masters of Learning were ever able to Teach and Instruct their Schollars; there was never any Man could Teach another when Asleep; they that are Taught ought to be more than Awake, they ought to exercise all their Senses, Care, and Diligence; but now God is such a Teacher, such an Instructor, that when we are Asleep, nay in a deep Sleep, he can convey In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and Teach us his Lessons: This surely doth magnifie his Skill, Divine Wisdom and Power: Who but God can teach thus? As he can give a Heart t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Understand, and can give Understanding to the Heart of Man, so he can teach us and discover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> up Instruction to us when we are asleep.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It may also be, because God would hereby assure us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> is (as it were)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41018:7"/>
laid aside, the Soul can go to work when the Body lyes like a Block, and stirs not; the Soul can bestir it self, and act about many matters, and run it's thoughts to the utmost ends of the Earth without the help of the Bodily Organs, or Powers; yea, raise up the thoughts to the highest Heavens, in blessed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse with God himself. There is no need to prove matter of Fact that it 'tis so: What Night, with reference to some or other, doth not utter this point of Knowledge? Nor, need I (saith the same Author) stay to prove that this is [if not a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative] yet a very Probable Argument of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Substantiality of the Soul from the Body; namely, it's Operations when the Body [with all it's proper and peculiar Faculties and Powers] is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, and contributes nothing to those Operations: And tho' it may be objected, that irrationa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may have Dreams; yet their Dreams do, no doubt, differ as much from those of Men as themselves do. To this effect <hi>Caryl,</hi> and other Learned Men speak.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But from hence I would not have people to regard all sorts of Dreams;<note place="margin">'Tis danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to regard all sorts of Dreams.</note> especially considering as I hinted before, Satan hath such power admitted him, as sometimes to suggest evil and pernicious thoughts into our Minds when we are asleep; some Dreams being <hi>Diabolical,</hi> and others arising from Natural Causes, and are Vain, and Ridiculous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It therefore ought to be considered how we may know Divine Dreams from others: And this be sure of,<note place="margin">How to know Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Dreams.</note> that whatsoever Dreams tend to draw the Soul from God, or to imbrace any Notion, or Doctrine that is repugnant to the Word of God, is not Divine; not from God, but from the Devil.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover let no person now expect God should speak unto them by <hi>Dreams</hi> or <hi>Visions</hi>; for tho' he did so frequently before Christ came, yet <hi>Now, in these last days, God hath spoken unto us by his Son</hi>;<note place="margin">Heb. 1.1.2.</note> and we have a <hi>more sure Word of Prophecy:</hi> God

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41018:49"/>
and of departing from the Truth, of obeying or disobeying of God, until confirmed by an Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Head.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From their Office this is further evident: They appear before God, they serve him, and we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make them our Patterns; they come to us, admonish us, teach, protect, and comfort us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y are said to appear to Men; as to <hi>Abraham, Jacob,</hi> and many others, tho not in their own spiritual Form. As so considered, no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Creature, doubtless, could behold them; for that is to render the Invisible World to be Visible: Sometimes they have appeared in assumption of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, tho not for the doing of their Work, but to manifest themselves to be familiar with men. <hi>Aquinas</hi> adds, That they might manifest the intelligible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and Converse, which men expect with them in another Life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Because Christ is said, not to take unto him the nature of Angels, and hath a Name given him above them. And in the Resurrection we shall be like to them. As to their Nature, they are Spirits incorporate, and immaterial;<note place="margin">Psal. 104.4</note> 
                  <hi>Who maketh his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Spirits:</hi> And again it is said,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Are they not all ministring Spirits? Tertullian,</hi> and some other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, asserted they have proper Bodies, tho invisible to us; but yet he seems to mean no more than a <hi>Substance:</hi> And as the same Author observes,
<q>If they have any such Composition, as may be called a Body, it is certainly of the greatest Fineness and Subtilty; a spiritual Body, and therefore not like to be of that grosness, that either the Air is, or those Heavens that are framed out of the same <hi>Chaos,</hi> but nearer the substance of the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; which seem to be made at the same time. Lastly, <hi>saith he,</hi> it will be safe to say, that in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of God they are Bodies, but in comparison of us, they are pure and mighty Spirits</q>
— To which let me add, I see not that the Saints, at the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41018:50"/>
Resurrection, (tho in some things they shall be as the Angels of God) yet not that their Bodies shall be such bodies as the Angels have; for tho the Saints be made spiritual Bodies, yet shall be material, <hi>i.e.</hi> of the same matter they now consist of, only refin'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let it be consider'd, (saith he) that as it is God only that is without beginning, so it belongs only to him to be without any possibility of change, or shadow of change; and that the Angels, as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are reducable to nothing by the same hand that made them, tho not from their own Nature; nor shall they ever cease to be, no more than the Spirits of all men, yet they are in God's hand, tho the best pieces of Nature, and if he withdraw his hand, they all moulder to nothing.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Angels (<hi>saith my Author</hi>) may properly be called Incorruptible and Immortal, because they are so by Nature. I speak not, <hi>saith he,</hi> now of the changableness of their Wills, but of their Nature and Substance: The Reasons are;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Because the Angels are not produced out of the power of Matter, or corporal Substance; as the Souls of <hi>Beasts,</hi> but only by the word of God; and therefore as they have internal principles of Being, so they have none of Dissolution; for there is the same reason of Being, and not Being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Angelical Nature, as the Souls also of Men are not compounded of Matter and Form, but are simple Forms and Substances, subsisting by themselves: Now all Corruption, Mortality, and Death, is by the separation of the Form from the Matter; as when the Soul is separated from the Body, which is Corruption, or Death, or when the accidental Form is separated from the Subject, as <hi>White</hi> from the <hi>Wall,</hi> or <hi>Health</hi> from the <hi>Man:</hi> Now, whatever wants Matter is corruptible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no Composition, and so no Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the Scripture concludes this best in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulating
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41018:50"/>
the state of Immortality, in which we shall be like the Angels.</p>
               </q>
               <p>I shall speak no more now as to the first thing proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Nature of Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall open a little of the Work and Office of the good Angels.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Work and Office of the Angels of God, is to minister unto Christ, or attend upon his glorious Person, as Mediator; as indeed they did in the days of his Humiliation.<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> A Reverend Author saith upon the place, <hi>this ascending &amp; descending of the Angels</hi> upon this Ladder,
<q>it does intimate and declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, their special regard and respect to him, (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jesus Christ) which is very eminent in them; these blessed glorious Spirits are very remarkable in their Observation of Christ; it is that which we may take notice of in every Mistery and passage concerning him, how the Angels were still imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about him, and subservient to him upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions whatsoever.</q>

I see no advantage this could be to us to have but one Angel particularly to take the Charge of us more than a multitude: (1.) Because of their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

Because it is far greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to a Prince to have mighty Hosts of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Persons to be his Retinue, than one noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son only. I shall therefore say no more to this, but proceed to the next general Head.</p>

                     <hi>Why doth Christ imploy the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to minister to his Saints?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because of that great love Jesus Christ hath to his Saints, seeing they have such a multitude of evil Angels to annoy them; therefore he sends them Hosts of good Angels to defend them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To greaten his own Glory; the greater and more glorious the Retinue of a Prince is, which he sends as a guard to his Favourites, the more it sets forth his own Greatness and Grandure; and since one Angel hath such mighty power, and is so glorious, that the Earth is said to be enlightned with it; (I know that is not a proper Angel, yet it shews the glory of an Angel is very great) What is the glory then of an innumerable Host of them? and yet they are all but Christ's Servants, and poor Nothings in comparison of him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. My Author saith,
<q>God doth it to preserve that <hi>Eutaxy,</hi> that good Order which he hath put into things: As thicker Bodies and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour are managed by more subtle and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful; so the bodies of Beasts by a spirit of life, and irrational Spirits by rational. As Men go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern Beasts, so by the same reason of proportion the Angels, which are invisible Spirits, and are all Spirits, have an influence upon Men, which are partly Spirits, and partly Bodies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It may be to shew what Honour he is pleased to confer upon his Saints, he will spare them his own Courtiers out of Heaven; they shall ride in his own Chariots. This he may do to honour his

People, to raise their Glory. Sirs, could the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly but see what an Host of Angels does attend upon the poorest Saint as he passes along, they would say, Who is this? what noble and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Person is this that has such a Guard, such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue? The greatest Monarch in the World hath no such Attendance as the poorest and meanest Saint hath.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another reason why God useth the Angels for the good of his People, or to attend on them and minister unto them, may be, because they are the Spouse of Christ, the Lamb's Bride: Certainly great Honour of right belongs to the Queen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering her near relation to the King.
