            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now the matter of their praier was, that God would establish his promise made to <hi>Dauid</hi> their King, concerning his church: that he might build a place for his aboade in <hi>Sion,</hi> the mountaine of his holinesse. It<note place="margin">Psal. 93.</note> was his care, it was his affliction.

            <p>This Arke thus tossed in the deluge, and tyred in the wildernes, despised of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, &amp; much neglected of the true borne
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8855:8"/>
Iewe, together with Labans much lowring at home, when in <hi>Iacob</hi> it was consumed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 40.</note> with heate in the day, and with frost in the night, weather beaten and weary, till <hi>Dauid</hi> a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ gaue it rest, who ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<note place="margin">Acts 13. 22. Psal. 49. 9.</note> vp with the zeale of Gods house de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured all difficulties for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who thought vpon nothing more then of a place, and habitation for his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to dwell in, his meate went from him, so did his sleepe, and hee charged his soule with an oath to God for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
            <p>These holy thoughts thus affecting his heart, &amp; afflicting his soule, made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sensible of his sorrowes, and therefore pierced their hearts to prouoke their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thus, <hi>Lord remember Dauid in all his Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein I doe obserue two things of<note place="margin">1</note> speciall note, the first is, the peoples passion for their King, they are afflicted with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therfore they pray for him, the second is <hi>Dauids</hi> preparation for the people, hee is<note place="margin">2</note> carefull of them, and therefore he prouides for them a place: <hi>an habitation for the Lord to dwell in.</hi> So as their feete might now wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8855:8"/>
no more, but stand in the great congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation they loued so wel, and by the <hi>Altars</hi> of their God they held so deare.</p>
            <p>And for the first: I meane the peoples passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their King, ye know the saying of old, <hi>Componitur orbis Regis ad exemplu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And<note place="margin">Claudian:</note> it hath it extent from Court to Country, for peoples passions are framed to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces affections, like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins they weepe together, and they laugh together, they liue together, and they dye together, witnesse their ioynt sorrowes after <hi>Abners</hi> herse; the King wept, and the people wept, &amp; though the people would feast; yet when<note place="margin">2. Sam. 3.</note> they sawe the King would fast, it pleased them, for as the text saith, <hi>whatsoeuer the King did pleased the people.</hi> His passions were theirs, his afflictions were theirs, to teach vs that peoples actions doe <hi>Sympathize</hi> with Princes affections, the Court is dead if the King bee not cheerefull, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects sorrowe, when their soueraignes are sadde, Princes smyles, are peoples ioyes like the lustre of the same, so are the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Kings: with their shine they carie comforts, but neuer so little sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with clowdes of griefe, (good

Lord) how the subiect then mourneth, deare is the loue of God in the soules of his Saints, but next to that is the sacred band of loue and loyaltie to Princes, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, friendes and families are further off, soueraignes are the highest in the rancke.</p>
            <p>If leasure would serue to turne ouer some fewe leaues of sorrowe, and search into the records of griefe, easily might I finde that peoples passions, for their Princes haue beene most piercing, great was their care ouer <hi>Dauid,</hi> when they stayed him from the battel, least the light of <hi>Israel</hi> should be extinguished. So was it ouer <hi>Saul</hi> when<note place="margin">2. Sam. 21 17.</note> they mourned his funerals with this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dittie; <hi>Yee mountaines of Gilboah, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you bee neither dewe, nor rayne, nor fieldes of offering for then the shield of the mightie is cast</hi>

               <hi>downe. The shield of Saul, as though he had not beene annointed with oyle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The mourning of <hi>Hadadrimmon</hi> in the<note place="margin">Zachar. 12. 11. 12.</note> valley of <hi>Megiddo,</hi> where <hi>Iosias</hi> was slaine, wil neuer bee forgotten, where euery familie mourned a part, &amp;c. and vttered their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with this pitifull plaint, <hi>the Crowne of</hi>

               <hi>our head is falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: woe vnto vs that euer we sinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8855:9"/>Lastly, that one may stand for all, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to your owne passions, who haue at any time seene your own soueraigne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your teares of ioy haue not expressed your feare of griefe, mourning like the <hi>Turtle-Doue,</hi> whose sweetest song is in her sorrowe; least hauing lost her mate shee should not finde him: and hauing found her mate, least shee might loose him, thousands within the kingdome doe thus blend in their moyst and mixt teares vpon the sight and thoughts of their soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</p>
            <p>And here leaue we the peoples passions, and come wee to their praier, the sweete perfume of their deuotion in these wordes. <hi>LORD remember Dauid in all his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

            <p>Wherein first I doe obserue, in that the people flye to GOD for their King with no lesse loue, then loyaltie they<note place="margin">Rom. 13. Prou. 8. 15. 16.

            <p>For he knewe with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and found it true in his owne experience, that no King is saued by the multitude of an hoaste, neither is the mightie man deliuered by his great strength, hee knewe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
