            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ye ought rather to ſupport him than otherwiſe
Than one of the ſquyers ſayd: What enuyous

dayes / and at his departyng it was ſet a fyre &amp;
brent vp clene / but the caſtell had no hurt / for it

they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de nother man nor beeſt abrode / for all

to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great plentie / bothe by lande and by ſee.
Than the kyng departed fro Ede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>borowe and
rode towarde Eſtruleyn a good towne / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there was a great abbey of blacke monkes / 
and mooſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menly the kynges of Scotlande

            <p>THe entent of the duke of Lancaſtre and

thought to encloſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bytwene Englande and
Scotlande / and to fight with them at their ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uauntage.
This purpoſe they thought veryly

brent the towne of ſaynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / where as the
ryuer of Taxe rynneth / and there is a good ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen
to ſayle thens ouer all the worlde / and after
they brent the towne of Donde. The Englyſſh

all on fyre. And ſo they of the vowarde ran to
Bredan / whiche is a cytie on the ſee ſyde / It is

            <p>THus in lykewiſe as the Englyſſhemen
dyde in Scotlande / ſo dyd the frenche

of Northumberlande and Wales. &amp; they brent
a great countre as they went out of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlande
and entred in to Wales / whiche was
otherwiſe called Wynſlande / and paſſed by the
landes of the lordes of Grayſtocke and Clyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde / 
and brent in their voyage dyuers great
villages / for they were no men of warre in that
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre as than / for they were all with the kyng.
So they came to the cyte of Catlyle in Wales / 
whiche was well cloſed with gatꝭ / walles / &amp; dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes:
It was a place that of auncyent tyme kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge

a baſtarde brother of the kynges / a ſage and a
valyant man called Deuyſe / but he was a man
of relygton / and was mayſter of the hoſpytals

the kynge of Portyngale. The ſiege endured
more than a hole yere / and conſtable of the hoſt
was the erle of Longueuyll / and Marſhall of

a knight of Limoſyn / who long before came in

This ſir Raynolde was a valiant knight and
well proued / And the kynge had well maryed

            <p>I Sir Iohan Froiſſarde make narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of this buſyneſſe / bycauſe whan
I was in the countie of Foyz and of

I demaunded and enquered of the newes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
countrey / ſuche as I knewe nat before: And it
was ſhewed me / howe the prince of wales and
of Aquitayne / whyle he was at Tarbe / he had
great wyll to go ſe the caſtell of Lourde / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
was a thre leages of / nere to the entre of the

well aduyſed the towne / the caſtell / and the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tre

of the caſtell / as bycauſe it ſtode on the fronter
of dyuers countreis / For the garyſone there / 
might ronne well in to the realme of Arragon / 
in to Catellon / and to Barſelon. Than the pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
called to hym a knyght of his houſholde / in
whom he had great truſte / and loued hym en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly:
and he had ſerued hym truely / and was
called ſir Pyer Ernalde / of the countre of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne
/ an experte man of armes and coſyn to the
erle of Foiz. Than the prince ſayde to hym. ſir
Ernalde / I inſtytue and make you Chateleyn
and capitayne of Lourde / &amp; gouernour of the

your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. There he dyde homage
to the prince / and the prince put hym in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
It is to be knowen / that whan the warre
began to renewe bytwene Englande &amp; Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
as it hath ben ſhewed before: The erle Guy of
ſaynt Poule and ſir Hugh of Chatellon may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the croſbowes in Fraunce / in that tyme
beſeged the towne of Abuyle / and wan it / with
all the countre of Poitou. The ſame tyme two
great barons of Bigore / thone called ſir Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nalte
Barbeſan and the lorde Danchyn tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
frenche / and toke the towne / cytie / and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
of Tarbe / whiche was but eaſely kept for
the kynge of Englande: But ſtyll the caſtell of
Lourde / was in the handes of ſir Pier Ernalt
of Bierne / who wolde in no wyſe yelde vp the
caſtell / but made euer great warre agaynſt the
realme of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / and ſent for great company
of aduenturers in to Bierne and Gaſcoyne / to
helpe and to ayde hym to make warre / ſo that
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:22067:27"/>
he had togyder many good men of armes. and
he had with hym ſixe capitayns / &amp; euery man
fyftie ſpeares vnder hym.</p>
            <p>The firſt was his brother Iohan of Bierne
a right expert ſquyer / and Pier Danchyne of
Bygore / brother germayne to the lorde Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyne
/ he wolde neuer tourne frenche / Nandon
of ſaynt Colombe / Ermalton of mount Ague
of ſaynt Baſyll / and the Bourge of Carnela.
Theſe capitayns made dyuers iourneys in to
Bygore / in to Tholouſyn / in to Carcaſſene / &amp;
in to Albygoiſe: For euer aſſone as they were
out of Lourde / they were in the lande of their
enemyes / and ſomtyme they wolde aduenture
thyrtie leages of fro their holde. And in their
goynge / they wolde take nothyng / but in their
retourne there was nothynge coulde ſcape the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Somtyme they brought home ſo great plentie
of beeſtes &amp; priſoners / that they wyſt nat howe
to kepe them. Thus they rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſomed all the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

Theſe companyons of Lourde ranne
ouer all the countre at their pleaſure / &amp; I rode
nat farre fro theym. Thus the cytie of Tarbe
was in great doute / ſo that they were fayne to

had no ayde nor ſocoure of any perſone: the ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pitayne
of Maluoyſen was a gaſcoyne / &amp; his

            <p>In the ſeaſon that I enterpriſed to go ſe the

and ſithe it was neuer made agayne. So in ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
deuyſes we rode all that day a longe by the

Pauyers. And this was in the begynnynge of
Auguſt / whan men dyd gather in their cornes

was great habundaunce in the countre. Than
ſir Iohan of Armynake and his company lod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged

of Pauyers / that without they wolde bye their

Than they of Pauiers were in great feare / for
the Erle their lorde was farre of fro them: for
he was as than in Byerne. And ſo they were
fayne to bye their owne cornes / and payed for
them fyue thouſande frankes / but they deſyred

and came ſodaynly in to the cytie of Pauyers
with .xii. hundred ſpeares. And ſo had fought
with ſir Iohan of Armynake if he had taryed / 
but he departed and wente in to the countie of
Comynges. So he had no money of them of
Pauyers / for they had no leyſar to tarye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But than therle of Foiz claymed the ſame
ſome / for he ſayd he was come / and ſaued their
money and corne: and had put awaye all their

had inned all their corne and vyntage. And ſo
we paſſed than foreby a caſtell called Bretytte /

Sir quod the ſquyer / I wolde gladly folowe

for in dede I am your coſyn. But ſir / I can nat

I ſhall go to them and ſhewe them as ye haue

So all thynges conſydred / they concluded to

conducted and all theirs to the caſtell Culyer / 
the whiche was kepte by ſome of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyons / 
on the fronter of Tholouſin. So thus
the capitayne retourned agayne to the hoſt to
ſpeke with ſir Garſes / and he agreed to their
deſyres: For he ſawe well the caſtell wolde nat
lightely be wonne by aſſaute / without loſſe of
moche people. So than they prepared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte
&amp; truſſed all their baggage / for they had
moche pyllage / they toke with them the beſt &amp;
lefte the reſydue. And ſit Garſes conueyed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to Culyer without daunger. Thus the frenche
men at that tyme gate this caſtell Trygalette.
Than ſir Garſes dyd gyue the caſtell to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
of the countre / and they dyd raſe it dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / 
as ye ſe: ſo that there was neuer none ſithe

ſit Garſes wente towarde the caſtell Nantyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leur /

Lameu. And as he wente thyderwarde /

ſir Garſes taryed in the ſelde &amp; deuyſed what
was beſt than to do. Than the ſeneſhall of No

to the contrarye ſhall neuer entre therin. Sir
quod they of Tholous / he ſayeth well / and he

Thus the caſtell of Na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tylleur was delyuered
to the ſeneſchall of Nobeſen / who incontynent
rode thyder and founde it clene voyde. Than
he newly fortifyed that was broken / and heſet

I ſhall render in to youre handes the caſtell of

ſayd / howe his countre of Bierne was ſo free a

was great and ſore feared / ſaid howe he wolde
compell hym ꝑforce / for therle of Armynake &amp;
the lorde Dalbret who loued nat therle of Foiz

of the beſt wyne that I dra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke of in all my

and whan it was late the knight departed
and retourned to the caſtell of Maluoyſin. and
the next mornyng we mounted on out horſes / 
and departed fro Tourney &amp; paſſed by a gyde

of Tarbe / &amp; entred in to Bigore: And we lefte
the waye to Lourde / to Bagueres / and to the
caſtell of Mountgaylliard on the lyfte hande.
And we rode towarde a vyllage called Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimytat / 
and dyd cooſt it / and came to a wode
in the lande of the lorde of Barbaſan / and we
came nere to a caſtell called Matheras / at the
entre of the countre of Layre. Than the knight
ſaid to me. Sir Iohan / beholde here the place
of Layre / and beholde it well &amp; aduyſe the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:22067:32"/>
my ſelfe but as loſt <abbr>ther</abbr> / if I had nat ben in the

the wordes that this knight had ſhewed me .ii.
or thre dayes before of that countre of Layre / 
and of the Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geant of Lourde. Than I ſayd

aduauntage / for ye maye beholde here the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
of Barbaſon and the Caſtell of Marthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras / 
wherin there was alwayes many men of
warre there / and in other garyſons / as Bague<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces / 
Tourney / Mountgalyarde / Salenges / 
Benache / Gorre / and Tarbe / all frenche tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

knewe that they of Lourde rode outher towar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
Tholous or Carcaſſone: Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wolde
laye buſſhementes for them / and ſomtyme take
fro them of Lourde their praye and pyllage / &amp;
ſomtyme they ſcaped without any rencounter.
And on a tyme it fortuned / that Eruaulton of
ſaynt Colombe and the Mengeant of ſaynte
Cornyle / and to the nombre of ſixſcore ſpeares
of good men of warre departed fro Lourde / a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bout

hogges / mottons / and lambes: and alſo they
toke dyuers of the good men of the countre pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoners / 
and ſo droue all their pray before them.
Than it was ſhewed to the capitayne of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
a ſquyer of Gaſcoyne / called Erualton By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſette / 
an experte man of armes / Howe they of
the garyſon of Lourde were abrode / and were

the lorde of Barbaſon / Certifyeng them howe
he wolde ryde out agaynſt theym of Lourde.
The knyghtes and ſquyers of the countrey of
Bigore agreed to ryde forthe / and aſſembled to
guyder at Tourney / and with them <abbr>ther</abbr> was
the Bourcke of Spaygne / who came fro his
garyſon of ſaynt Bearte. So they were to the
nombre of two hundred ſpeares / and they had
their ſpyes abrode in the Countrey / to knowe
what they of Lourde dyde. On the other ſyde / 
they of Lourd had abrode their ſpies to knowe
if any men of warre were abrode to lette them

eyther partie knewe what other dyde. Whan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
they of Lourde knewe howe they of the frenche
garyſons were abrode and taryed for them at
Tourney / Than they were in doute / and toke
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle what they might beſt do / to ſaue their

company in two. The one company to driue

and to go couertly by the lane of Bourge / and
ſo to paſſe the waye by the bridge of Tourney

and Mountgalyarde: And ſayd / that if

than they ſhulde be in ſauegarde / for than we

ſo they dyde. And the baſtarde of Caruyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacke / 
Guyllonet of Harmyes / and Perot Bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyer / 
Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Calleuyn of Baſile / the reed ſquier

and ſo they departed / and the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
as Erualton of Reſtue / Erualton of ſai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
Colombe / and the Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geant of ſaynt Coruyle
with fourſcore men of armes / there was nat .x.
varlettes among them. So they made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf
redy and rode cloſe toguyder / euer lokyng for
their enemyes: For they knewe well they were
abrode to watche for them. In lyke maner as
they of Lourde had taken their aduiſe and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayle
howe to retourne / in lykewiſe the frenche
men tooke counſayle howe they might encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their enemyes / and ſir Monant of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan
and Erualton Byſſet / ſayd to their compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye.
Sirs / we knowe well howe they of Lour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
are abrode in the feldes / and driueth before
them great praye and many priſoners. It ſhul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
be a great dyſpleaſure to vs / if they ſhulde
ſcape: Therfore lette vs put our ſelfe in to two
buſſhementes / we are company ynough ſo to
do. Than it was ordayned that Erualton and
the Bourge of Spayne / ſir Raymonde of Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nache
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:22067:32"/>
and Anguerot Lane with a hundred ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res / 
ſhulde kepe the paſſage at Tourney: For
they knewe well that they of Lourd with their
praye muſt nedes paſſe the ryuer of Lyſſe. and
it was ordayned / that the lorde of Barbaſone
and Erualton Byſet with a hundred ſpeares / 
ſhulde ryde at aduentures. So this they deꝑ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted / 
and the lorde of Benache and the Bourge
of Spaygne put them ſelfe in a buſſhment / by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene
Maluoyſin and Turney / and the other
company rode and toke the ſame waye that we
be nowe in / which is called the Layre / and here
they mette with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Lourde. And whan eche
of them ſawe other / they a lyghted and made
them redy to fyght / And ſo came eche agaynſt
other cryeng their cryes / ſaynt George Lourd
and the other our lady of Bigore. and ſo there
eche came to other with hande ſtrokes / foynin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
with their ſpeares eche at other a great ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce / 
and as I herde reported of them that were
<abbr>ther</abbr> / at the firſt brunt there was none ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen.
And ſo whan eche of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had a great ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
foyned eche at other / they caſte downe their
ſpeares and toke their axes and gaue therwith
eche to other great and horrible ſtrokes / euery
man with his matche / and in that maner they
fought toguyder more than two houres: And
whan any of them had fought ſo long that they
lacked brethe / than they wolde fayre and eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
departe / and go ſytte downe by a dyke ſyde
that was full of water / and put of their baſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nettes
and refreſſhe them ſelfe. And whan they
were well refreſſhed / they putte on their baſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netes
and retourned agayne to fight. I beleue
there was nat ſuche a buſyneſſe nor a batayle
ſo well fought (ſithe the batayle y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was in Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
of .xxx. agaynſt as many) As this was
here at Martheras in Bigore. Thus they
fought hande to hande / and Erualton of ſaynt
Colombe was at the poynt to haue ben diſcon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyted
by aſquyer of the countre called Guyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of Salynges. This Erualton of ſaint Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lombe
had a varlet / who ſtode by and ſawe the
batayle and fought nat / for <abbr>ther</abbr> was none that
ſayd any thyng to hym. And whan he ſawe his
maiſter almoſt at vttraunce he was ſorie / and
ſo came to his maiſter and tooke his axe out of
his handes and ſayd. Erualton / go your waye
and reſt you / ye can no lengar fight. And than
he with the axe wente to the ſquyer &amp; gaue him
ſuche a ſtroke on the heed that he was aſtonied
and had nere hande fallen to the erthe. Whan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
Guyllonet felte hym ſelfe ſtryken he was ſore
diſpleaſed / and came agaynſt the varlet to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
ſtryken hym / but the varlet ſtepte vnder the
ſtroke and enbraſed the ſquyer / who was ſore
traueyled with ſo long fightyng / &amp; ſo the var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
ouerthrewe hym wreſtlyng vnder hym. tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the varlet ſayde. I ſhall ſlee the / without thou
wylte yelde thy ſelfe to my maiſter. Who is thy
mayſter quod the ſquyer? Erualton of ſaynt
Colombe quod the varlette / with whome thou
haſte fought all this ſeaſon. The ſquyer ſawe
that he had nat the vauntage / but that he was
vnder the varlette / who had a daggar redy to
ſtryke hym. So he yelded hym to rendre his
body priſoner at Lourde within fyftene dayes
after / reſcues or no reſcues. This ſeruyce dyd
this varlet to his maiſter. And ſir Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you / <abbr>ther</abbr> were many feates of armes done
and many ouerthrowen and taken priſoners / 
ſome to yelde them ſelfe in a certayne ſpace at
Tarbe / and ſome to come to Lourde. They
fought this day hande to hande / Erualton By
ſet with the Mengeant of ſaynt Baſyll / they
dyde many a feate of armes bytwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and
they fought ſo long till they were ſo wery / that
they coude ayde them ſelfe no lengar. and <abbr>ther</abbr>
was ſlayne on the place two capitayns / the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
geant of Lourde / and on the other parte Erual<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton
Byſſet. Than ceaſed the batayle by agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of bothe parties / for they were ſo wery / 
that they coude ſcante holde their axes in their
handes. Some vnarmed them to refreſſhe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſelfe / and lefte their armure in the place. They
of Lourde bare awaye with them the Menge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
ſlayne / and the frenche men bare Erualton
Byſſet to Tarbe. And to thentent that this ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayle
ſhulde be had in remembraunce <abbr>wher</abbr> as
the two ſquyers fought / there was ſet a Croſſe
of ſtone / beholde yonder is the Croſſe. &amp; with
thoſe wordes we came to the Croſſe / and there
we ſayd for their ſoules a Pater noſter and an
Aue maria. By my faythe ſir quod I / I am
gladde I haue herde this / for this was a ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
buſyneſſe of ſo lytell people. But ſir / what
became of them that wente with the praye? I
ſhall ſhewe you quod he. They came to the ꝑte
of Tourney beſyde Maluoyſin / to haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
there as they had ordayned / And <abbr>ther</abbr> they
founde the buſſhment of the Bourge of Spay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gne / 
who brake out of their buſſhment / &amp; they
of Lourde coude nat recule backe / they had no
remedy / but to adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture their ſelfe. And I tell
you trouthe / there was as ſore a fight and as
long endured or lengar / than that at Marthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras:
<pb facs="tcp:22067:33"/>
and there Erualton of Spayne dyde mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueylous
in armes / He had an axe in his hande / 
who ſoeuer he ſtrake therwith went to the erth
for he was bygge and well made / and nat ouer
charged with moche fleſſhe. He toke <abbr>ther</abbr> with
his owne handes the two capitayns / the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
of Coruyle and Perot Palatyne of Bierne
and there was ſlayne a ſquier of Nauar called
Fera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do of Myrando / who was an expert man
of armes. ſome that were at the buſyneſſe ſayd
that the Bourge of Spaygne ſlewe hym / and
ſome ſayd he was ouercome for heat in his har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe.
Finally the praye was reſcewed / and all
taken or ſlayne that wente therwith / <abbr>ther</abbr> were
but thre ſaued them ſelfe / and they were varlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
who departed and wente ouer the ryuer of
Lyſſe. Thus became of this aduenture: They
of Lourde neuer loſte before ſo moche as they
dyde than: They were courteſly raunſomed / 
and dyuers delyuered by exchaunge one for a
nother / For dyuers of them that fought here at
the place of Layre / were taken by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Lourd
Therfore euery parte were courteyſe one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother / 
in raunſomyng of their companyons.
Ah ſaynt Mary ſir quod I / is the Bourge of
Spaygne ſo bygge a man as ye ſpeke of? yea
ſir truely quod he / for in all Gaſcoyne there is
none lyke hym in ſtrength of body / therfore the
erle of Foiz hath hym euer in his company. It
paſte nat a thre yere that he dyde in a ſporte a
great dede / as I ſhall ſhewe you.</p>
            <p>So it was on a Chriſtmas day / the Erle of
Foiz helde a great feeſt and a plentifull of kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes
and ſquyers / as it is his vſage: And it
was a colde day / and the erle dyned in the hall / 
and with hym great company of lordes. And
after dyner he deꝑted out of the hall and wente
vp in to a galarye of .xxiiii. ſtayres of heyght / 
in whiche galarye <abbr>ther</abbr> was a great Chymney
wherin they made fyre / whan therle was <abbr>ther.</abbr>
and at that tyme there was but a ſmall fyre / for
the erle loued no great fyre / how be it he hadde
woode ynoughe there about / and in Bierne is
wode ynoughe. The ſame daye it was a great
froſt and very colde: And whan the erle was in
the galarye and ſawe the fyre ſo lytell / he ſayde
to the knightes and ſquiers about hym. Sirs
this is but a ſmall fyre / &amp; the day ſo colde: than
Erualton of Spayne went downe the ſtayres
and beneth in the courte he ſawe a great meny
of Aſſes laden with woode to ſerue the houſe / 
Than he wente and toke one of the gretteſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
with all the Woode and layde hym on his
backe / and went vp all the ſtayres in to the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary / 
and dyde caſt downe the Aſſe with all the
woode in to the chymney / and the Aſſes fete vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde
/ Wherof the erle of Foiz had great ioye
and ſo hadde all they that were there / and had
marueyle of his ſtrength / howe he alone came
vp all the ſtayres with the Aſſe and the woode
in his necke. I toke great pleaſure in this tale
and in other that this knyght ſir Eſpaygne de
Leon ſhewed me / wherby I thought my iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
moche the ſhorter. And in ſhewyng of theſe
maters / we paſſed the paſe of Layre and the ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtell
of Martheras / where as the batayle was / 
and ſo we rode nere to the caſtell of Barbaſon / 
whiche is ſtronge &amp; fayre / and is within a lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
of Tarbe / whiche we ſawe before vs / and a
fayre waye coſtyng the ryuer of Lyſſe comyng
fro the mountayns. Than we rode fayre and
eaſely at our leyſar to refreſſhe our horſes. and
there he ſhewed me the ryuer / the caſtell / &amp; the
towne of Mountgalyarde / and the waye that
laye to Lourde. Than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e it came to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
to demaunde the knight / howe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
of Aniou whan he was in the countrey / and
that the caſtell of Maluoyſin was yelded to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / 
came before Lourde / and what he dyd there. &amp;
with right a good wyll he ſhewed me and ſaid.
Whanne the duke of Aniowe departed frome
Maluoyſin withall his hoſt / he paſſed ouer the
ryuer of Lyſſe at the bridge of Tourney / and
wente and lodged at Baguiers / where as is a
good ryuer goynge to Tarbe / for this ryuer of
Tourney cometh nat thyder / but falleth in to
the ryuer of Garon beſyde Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tunllyon / and
ſo the duke went and layd ſiege to Lourde. ſir
Peter Erualton of Bierne and Iohan his bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther / 
Peter Danchyn / Erualton of Reſtue / Er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ualton
of ſaynt Colombe / and the Mengeant / 
who as than was lyueng / and Ferando of My<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rando

and the Burge Canuſe / and certayne
other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions beyng within Lourde. Whan
they were well enfourmed of the dukes comyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
thyder / they fortifyed them and their gary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
agaynſt hym / &amp; helde the towne of Lourde
for all the ſautes that the duke made / Whiche
fyftene dayes contynually endured / and there
were many feates of armes done. The duke or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dayned
many Inſtrumentes of warre for the
ſaute / ſo that finally the towne was wonne / but
they loſte neyther man / woman / nor good: for
they were all withdrawen in to the caſtell / For
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:22067:33"/>
they knewe well at length the towne wolde nat
holde / for it was cloſed but with dykes and pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les.
Whan the towne of Lourde was won the
Frenche men had great ioye / and ſo lodged in
the towne rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de about the caſtell / whiche was
nat prignable without it were with long ſiege
There the duke taryed more than ſixe wekes / 
and loſt more than he wanne / for they without
coulde do no hurte to them within / for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
ſtandeth on a rounde rocke / made in ſuche
maner / that no man coude aproche it by ſcalyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
nor other wyſe / but by one entre: And there
at the barryers were many ſcrimyſſhes &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
feates of armes done / and dyuers knightes
and ſquyers of Fraunce were hurte / ſuche as
wolde preſe to nere. Whan the duke ſawe howe
he coude nat haue his entent to gette the caſtell
of Lourde / than he fell in treatie with the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
within / and offred him moche money to
gyue vp the garyſon. The knight who was of
great valyanteſſe excuſed hymſelfe and ſaid.
Howe the garyſon was nat his / but it partey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the herytage of the kynge of Englande / 
and ſayd: Howe he coude nat ſell it nor gyue it
nor putte it awaye / without he ſhulde be a tray
tour / whiche in no wyſe he wolde be / but trewe
to his naturall lorde durynge his lyfe: &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
ſayd / that whan the caſtell was delyuered
hym / it was on a condycion / whiche he ſware
ſolempnely by his faythe in the prince of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les

were agaynſt the kyng of Englande. The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
coude neuer haue other anſwere of hym / for
gyfte nor promyſe that he coulde make. And
whan the duke of Aniou and his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile ſawe
howe they coude haue nothynge els / and ſawe
that they loſte their payne / they diſlodged / and
at their departynge they clene brent the towne.
Than the duke of Aniowe drewe backe in coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtynge
Bierne / and rode towarde the Mount
Marſen / and had knowledge howe the erle of
Foiz had fortifyed all his garyſons with men
of warre / wherof he was nothyng dyſcontent / 
but he was diſpleaſed / in that the knyghtꝭ and
ſquyers of Bierne helde Lourde agaynſt hym
The erle of Foyz (as I haue ſhewed you here
before) doughted greatly the duke of Aniowe / 
thoughe the duke dyde hym no hurte: But the
erle of Arminake and the lorde Dalbret wolde
haue had the Duke to haue made hym warre / 
but the duke had no wyll there to: But whyle
he lodged bytwene Mounte Marſen and the
Boce Dalbret / he ſent to the erle to Ortaiſe ſir
Peter of Beule / whom the erle receyued hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
and lodged hym in the caſtell of Ortaiſe / 
and made hym as good chere as he coude / and
gaue hym mulettes and courſers / &amp; to his men
great gyftes. And he ſente by hym to the duke
of Aniowe foure courſers and two Allans of
Spaygne / fayre and good. And there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete

            <p>ANone after that the duke of Aniou had

And whan the knyght had reed therles letters /

Brother Iohan / the erle of Foyz hath ſente for

And it is nat mete for me to haue the yuell wyll

for yre / and ſayd drawyng out his daggar:
A treatour / ſayeſt thou nay? By my heed thou
haſt nat ſayd that for nought: and ſo therwith
ſtrake the knight that he wounded hym in fyue
places / and there was no knyght nor barone y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

ſayd. Ah ſit / ye do me no gentylneſſe / to ſende

to the knyght / Was nat this a great crueltie?
Whatſoeuer it was ꝙ the knyght thus it was.
Lette one aduyſe hym well or he diſpleaſe him / 
for and he be angry there is no pardon. He hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

ſir quod I / hath the erle of Foyz no chyldren?
No truely ſir quod he by any wyfe / but he hath

Than I demaunded yf euer he were maryed.
yea truely quod he / and is yet / but his wyfe is

he ſhe is in Nauar / for the kyng there is her co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyn /

yet than I demaunded if euer the erle had

Sir ꝙ he I ſhall ſhewe you / but nat as nowe / 
for the mater is ouer longe / and we are nere the

peace and ſo we came to Tarbe / and toke oure

            <p>THe nexte day after maſſe we mounted a

I demaunded of hym / if the towne of Panne

That is trewe ſir quod I: But dyde he neuer

ought to be well content with the erle of Foyz / 
whan he ſlewe ſuche a knight his owne coſyn /

the duke of Berry and the duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne

Whan they of Languedocke vnderſtode y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the

ſir / I am ſore diſpleaſed of one thynge. What
is that ꝙ he? I ſhall ſhewe you. By my faithe
that ſo hyghe and valyant a prince as the Erle

Nay ſir ꝙ he / the Vycount of the caſtell Bone
his coſyn germayne is his heyre. Is he a valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant

ſir quod he / and therfore the Erle loueth hym

baſtardes ſhulde be made herytours of landes
Wherfore nat ſir quod he / if there lacke good

crowned Henry a baſtarde to be kyng? and
alſo they of Portyngale crowned a baſtarde to

Sir quod I / all this might well be / <abbr>ther</abbr> is no

you ſhewe me the iuſt cauſe why the warre firſt

I wyll ſhewe you ꝙ the knight. I enſure you
it is a marueylous warre / for as they ſaye / eche

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yere paſt / there was a lorde in Byerne cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
Gaſcone / a ryght valyant man in armes / &amp;
is buryed in the freres right ſolempnely at Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taiſe / 
and there ye may ſe what perſone he was
of ſtature and of body / for in his lyfe tyme his
pycture was made in latyn / the whiche is yet
there. This Gaſcone lorde of Bierne had two
doughters / the eldeſt was maryed to the erle of
Armynake that was than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e / and the yongeſt to
the erle of Foiz / who as than was nephue to the
kyng of Aragon / and as yet therle of Foiz bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his armes / for he diſcended out of Aragon
his armes are palle golde and goules: And ſo
it fortuned / that this lorde of Biern had a gret
warre agaynſt the kynge of Spayne that was
than / who came through all Biſquay w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a gret
nombre of men of warre to entre in to Bierne.
The lorde Gaſcone of Bierne whan he was en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formed
of his comyng / he aſſembled people on
all ſydes / where he might get men of warre / &amp;
wrote letters to his two ſonnes in lawe / therle

Theſe letters ſene / the erle of Foiz as

great ioye. And ſo all they paſſed the bridge at
Ortaiſe ouer the ryuer / &amp; lodged bytwene Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>netere

who had .xx.M. men was lodged nat far thens

letters by an haraulde to the lorde Gaſcoine of
Bierne / and ſente hym worde howe he myght

the lorde Gaſcoyne herde thoſe tidynges of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſacions / 
and ſawe howe heſhulde haue none

was ſore abaſſhed / and demaunded counſayle
of the erle of Foiz / and of the other barones of
Bierue / howe they ſhulde maynteyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfe.
Sir quod the erle of Foiz / ſithe we be here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
let vs go and fight with our enemyes.
this counſayle was taken / than they ordayned
their people / they were a twelfe hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred men of
armes and ſixe thouſande men a fote. The erle
of Foiz tooke the firſt batayle / and ſo came on
the kyng of Spaygne and ſette on his lodgyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges.
And <abbr>there</abbr> was a great batayle and a fierſe
and ſlayne mo than ten thouſande ſpayniardꝭ / 
and there therle of Foiz toke priſoners the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge

them to his father in lawe the lorde Gaſcoyne
of Bierne / who was in the areregarde. &amp; there
the ſpaynyerdes were ſo diſconfyted / that the
erle of Foiz chaſed them to the porte ſaynt Adri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an
in Biſquay / and the kynge of Spayne toke
the abbey / and dyde on the veſture of a monke
or els he had ben taken. Than the erle of Foiz
retourned to the lorde Gaſcone of Bierne / who
made hym good chere / as it was reaſon / for he
had ſaued his honour and kepte his countre of
Bierne / the whiche els was lykely to haue ben
loſte / bycauſe of this batayle and diſconfyture
that the erle of Foiz made on the ſpaygnierdes
and for the takyng of the kynges ſonne and bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther / 
and the lorde of Bierne hadde peace with
the ſpaygnierdes / at his owne wyll: And whan
the lorde Gaſcoyne was retourned to Ortaiſe / 
there before all the barons of Foiz and Bierne / 
that were there preſent: Heſayd to his ſonne of
Foiz. Fayre ſonne / ye are my true and faithfull
ſonne / ye haue ſaued myne honour and my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey.
The erle of Armynake who hath maryed
myne eldeſt doughter / hath ercuſed hym ſelfe
fro this buſyneſſe / and wolde nat come to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
myne herytage wherin he ſhulde haue part / 
Wherfore I ſaye / that ſuche parte as he ſhulde
haue by reaſon of my doughter / he hath forfait
and loſt it / And here clerely I enheryte you my
ſonne of Foiz after my dyſceaſe of all the hoole
lande / and to your heyres for euer. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre / 
wyll / and commaunde all my ſubiectes / to

howe they were well contente ſo to do.
Thus by this meanes / as I haue ſhewed you / 
aunciently the erles of Foiz were lordes of the
countre of Bierne / and bare the crye / armes / &amp;
name: and had the profyte therof. Howe be it / 
for all this they of Arminake had nat their clay

twene Foiz and Armynake. By my faythe ſir
than quod I / ye haue well declared the mater;
I neuer herde it before. And nowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I knowe
it / I ſhall putte it in perpetuall memorie / if god
gyue me grace to retourne in to my countrey.
But ſir / if I durſte I wolde fayne demaunde
of you one thynge. by what inſydent the erle of
Foiz ſonne dyed? Thafie the knyght ſtudyed a

And whan any letter were delyuered him / and

And ſo ſhe departed and rode to Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pylone

The erle of Foiz whan he ſawe the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge

whan the erle herde the people howe they deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Than he thought to chaſtyce hym in priſone a

Than he gaue leaue to all the people to depart
but they of Foiz wolde nat departe fro Ortaiſe
tyll the erle ſhulde aſſure them / that Gaſcoyne
ſhulde nat dye: they loued the chylde ſo well.
Than the erle promyſed them / but he ſayd: he
wolde kepe hym in priſone a certayne ſpace to

man departed / and Gaſcone abode ſtyll in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone.
Theſe tidynges ſpredde abrode in to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

by that tyme he came to Beſiers he herde ſuche

            <p>THe erle of Foyz cauſed his ſonne to be

all the meate that had been brought hym ſtode
hole and entier / the day of his dethe: wherfore
it was great marueyle that he lyued ſo longe /

all that ſeaſon the chylde laye in his clothes as

an ende. The ſame day that he dyed they that
ſerued hym of meate &amp; drinke / whan they came

you: he made no care therof / and ſayde: Sette
it downe there. He that ſerued hym / regarded
and ſawe in the priſon all the meate ſtande hole
as it had been brought hym before: And ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

went out of his chambre / and came to the

had the lytell knyfe in his hande / nat an ynche

Why doeſt nat thou eate thy meate? And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Erle departed without any more do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
or ſayeng / and went in to his owne cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre.
The chylde was abaſſhed and afrayed of
the comynge of his father / and alſo was feble
of faſtynge / and the poynt of the knyfe a lytell

ſodaynly and dyed. The erle was ſcante in

Than the Erle was ſore diſpleaſed / and made

and wolde nat ſhewe what ſhe ayled. On
the thirde dayeſhe ſayd to her huſbande: Sir /

thus the next night that this ſir Peter had thus

Remembre ye of the blame &amp; ſhame that

            <p>THe wordes and counſails that the kyng

them ſelfe ſo wery of the warre: &amp; ſo ſpake

make no warre but by the frenchmen / and in

great enuy at the frenche men / whiche well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered:
For whan the fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che varlettes went out
a forragyng / if the ſpayniſſhe forrengers were
ſtronger / than they wolde take their forage fro
them and beate them and mayme them / ſo that
complayntes came therof to the kynge / and he
blamed therfore his marſhall ſir Raynolde Ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moſyn

for this mater? The marſhall excuſed hym and
ſayde: As god might helpe hym / he knewe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge

men of armes to kepe the feldes / that the

            <p>So it was the ſame weke / that the kyng of

they came to Burdeux and <abbr>ther</abbr> aſſembled and

to demaunde if any were abaſſhed to abyde the

kyng. Than the kyng cauſed all that wolde be

the order of knighthode is as noble and highe / 
as any herte can thynke. and there is no knight
that ought to be a cowarde nor ſhamefull / but
ought to be fierſe and hardy as a lyon / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his

aſſayla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / for ſuche englyſſhe archers as were
there ſhot ſo holly toguyder / that their arowes
pearſed men &amp; horſe / and whan the horſes were
full of arowes they fell one vpon another. than
the Englyſſhmen of armes / the portugaloys / &amp;
Lyxbonoyes / came on them cryeng their cryes
our lady of Portugale / with good ſpeares and
ſharpe heedes / wherwith they ſtrake and hurte
many knightes and ſquyers. There was the
lorde of Lanache of Bierne beaten downe / and
his baner won and he taken priſoner / and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his men taken and ſlayne. alſo ſir Iohan
of Ree / ſir Geffray Richon / ſir Geffray of par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teney / 
and all their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyes that were entred
within the ſtrayte / There horſes were ſo hurte
with tharchers / that they fell on their mayſters
and one vpon another. There theſe frenchmen
were in great danger / for they coulde nat helpe
one another / for they had no roume to enlarge
them ſelfe / nor to fight at their wyll. And whan
the portugaloys ſawe that myſchefe fall on the
firſt aſſaylers they were gladde / and as freſſhe
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:22067:50"/>
and coragyous to fyght as any men might be.
There was the kynge of Portugale with his
baners before hym / mounted on a good horſe / 
trapped with the armes of Portugale / and he
had great ioye to ſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> myſchefe fall on his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes:
and to conforte his people he laughed &amp;
ſayd a highe. On forthe good men / defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de you
and fight with good wyll / for if <abbr>ther</abbr> be no mo
but theſe we nede nat to feare / and if I knewe
euer any thynge in batayle / all theſe be ours.
Thus the kyng of Portugale reconforted his
people who fought valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly / and had encloſed
in the ſtreight all the firſt aſſaylers / of whome
<abbr>ther</abbr> were many ſlayne. True it was that this
firſt batayle whiche theſe knightes of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and of Bierne ledde / had thought to haue ben
quickelyer ayded of the ſpaynerdes than they
were / For if the kyng of Caſtyle and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany / 
who were a twentie thouſande men / had
come by another parte and aſſayled the portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galoys / 
it had been lykely the iourney to haue
ben theirs / but they dyde nothynge / wherfore
they were to blame and receyued domage. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in dede the frenchmen ſette on to ſoone / but
they dyde it to thentent to haue won honoure / 
and to maynteyne the wordes they had ſpoken
before the kyng: and alſo as I was enformed / 
the ſpaynierdes wolde nat ſette on ſo ſoone / for
they loued nat the frenchmen / for they had ſaid
before: Lette them alone / they ſhall finde right
well to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to ſpeke / theſe fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chmen ar great

let vs ſuffre them to take it / or els we ſhall
haue all at our ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. Thus by thſe meanes
the ſpanynierdes ſtode ſtyll in a great batayle / 
and wolde nat go forwarde / whiche was right
diſpleſant to the kyng / but he coude nat ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
it / but the ſpaynierdes ſayd / bycauſe <abbr>ther</abbr> was
none retourned fro the batayle. ſir / ſurely theſe
knightes of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce haue diſconfyted your ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myes / 
thonour of this iourney is theirs / God
gyue grace quod the kyng that it be ſo / Let vs
ryde than ſomwhat forwarde / that they rode
a croſbowe ſhotte forwarde and than agayne
reſted: It was a great beautie to ſe them / they
were ſo well mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted &amp; armed / and in the mean

            <p>Who ſoeuer were in ſuche caſe of armes as
the frenchmen and portugaloys were at Iube<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>roth / 
muſt abyde the aduenture as they dyde / 
without they wolde flye awaye / and in flyeng
there is more paryll than to abyde the batayle /

that the knightes of Fraunce / of Bretayne / of

fought / but at their firſt encountre they
were hardely handled / and all that was by the
counſayle of the Englyſſhmen to fortyfie their
place. So at this firſt batyle the portugaloys
were ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger than their enemyes / ſo they were
all taken or ſlayne / but fewe that were ſaued / ſo
that there were at that firſte brunt a thouſande
knightes and ſquyers taken priſoners / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the portugaloys were ioyfull / and thought
as that day to haue no more batayle / &amp; ſo made
good chere to their priſoners / and euery man
ſayd to their priſoners. Sirs be nat abaſſhed
for ye are won by clene feate of armes / we ſhall
kepe you good company as we wolde ye ſhuld

Lixbone and refreſſhe you there / and ſhalbe at

one thyng that I haue oftentymes thought on
ſithe / and ſhall do as longe as I lyue. As this
ſquyer tolde me / that of trouthe the nexte daye
after the bataile was thus fought at Iuberoth
the erle of Foiz knewe it / wherof I had great
marueyle: For the ſayd ſonday / monday / and
tueſday / therle was very penſyfe / and ſo ſadde
of chere / that no man coulde here a worde of
hym. And all the ſame thre dayes he wolde nat
iſſue out of his chambre / nor ſpeke to any man
thoughe they were neuer ſo nere about hym.
And on the Tueſday at night he called to hym
his brother Arnault Guyllyam / and ſayde to
hym with a ſofte voyce. Our men hath had to
do wherof I am ſorie / for it is come of them by

he drewe me a parte into a corner of the chapell

            <p>IT is well a twentie yeres paſte / that
there was in this countrey a barone / 
called Raymon lorde of Coraſſe / whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
is a ſeuyn leages fro this towne of Ortaiſe
This lorde of Coraſſe had y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame tyme a plee
at Auygnon before the pope / for the dyſmes of
his churche / agaynſt a clerke curate there: the
whiche preeſt was of Cateloygne. He was a

great cleke / and claymed to haue ryght of the
dyſmes in the towne of Coraſſe / whiche was
valued to a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred florens by the yere / and the
right that he had he ſhewed and proued it. And
by ſentence diffynityue / pope Vrbane the fyfte
in conſiſtory generall / condempned the knight
and gaue iugement with the preeſt. and of this
laſt iugement he had letters of the pope for his
poſſeſſion / &amp; ſo rode tyll he came in to Bierne / 
and there ſhewed his letters &amp; bulles of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
for his poſſeſſion of his diſmes. The lorde
of Coraſe had great indignacion at this preeſt
and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to hym &amp; ſaid. mayſter Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> or maiſter
Marten / as his name was: Thynkeſt y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> that
by reaſon of thy letters / that I wyll leſe myne
herytage? Nat ſo hardy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou take any thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
that is myne / if thou do it ſhall coſte the thy
lyfe / Go thy waye in to ſome other place to get
the a benefyce / for of myne herytage thou get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
no parte / and ones for alwayes I defende
the. The clerke douted the knight for he was a
cruell man / therfore he durſte nat parceyuer.
Than he thought to retourne to Auygnon as
he dyde / but whan he departed he came to the
knight the lorde of Coraſſe and ſayd. Sir / by
force and nat by right / ye take away fro me the
right of my churche / wherin ye greatly hurte
your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. I am nat ſo ſtrong in this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

as ſoone as I maye / I ſhall ſende to you ſuche
a champyon / whome ye ſhall doute more than
me. the knight who douted nothyng his thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges
ſayd: God be with the / do what thou
mayſt / I doute no more dethe than lyfe / for all
thy wordes / I wyll nat leſe myne herytage.
Thus the clerke departed fro the lorde of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe / 
and went I can nat tell wheder / to Auy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnon
or into Cateloygne / and forgate nat the
promyſe that he had made to the lorde of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe
or he departed. For afterwarde whan the
knyght thought leeſt on hym / about a thre mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes
after / as the knyght laye on a nyght a
bedde in his caſtell of Coraſſe with the ladye
his wyfe / there came to hym meſſangers in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyble / 
and made a marueylous tempeſt &amp; noiſe
in the caſtell / that it ſemed / as thoughe the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
ſhulde haue fallen downe / and ſtrake gret
ſtrokes at his chambre dore / that the good la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
his wyfe was ſoore afrayde. The knyght
herde all but he ſpake no worde therof / bycauſe
he wolde ſhewe no abaſſhed corage / for he was
hardy to abyde all aduentures. This noyſe &amp;
tempeſt was in ſondrie places of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> caſtell / and
dured a longe ſpace / and at laſte ceſſed for that
nyght. Than the nexte mornynge / all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
of the houſe came to the lorde whan he
was ryſen and ſayd. Sir / haue you nat herde
this night that we haue done? The lorde dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſymuled
and ſayd no / I herde nothyng. What
haue you herde. Than they ſhewed him what
noyſe they <abbr>hadd</abbr> herde / and howe all the veſſell
in the kechyn was ouertourned. Than the lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
began to laughe and ſayde. yea ſirs / ye dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med / 
it was nothynge but the wynde. In the
name of god quod the ladye / I herde it well.
The nexte night there was as great noyſe and
greatter / and ſuche ſtrokes gyuen at his cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre
dore and wyndowes / as all ſhulde haue bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken
in peces. The knyght ſtarte vp out of his
bedde / and wolde nat lette to demaunde who
was at his chambre dore that tyme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night:
and anone he was aunſwered by a voyce that
ſayde / I am here. Quod the knyght / who ſent
the hyder? The clerke of Catelloygne ſent me
hyder quod the voyce / to whom thou doſt gret
wronge / for thou haſt taken fro hym the rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of his benefyce / I wyll nat leaue the in reſt
tyll thou haſte made hym a good accompte / ſo
that he be pleaſed. Quod the knyght / what is
thy name / that arte ſo good a meſſangere? ꝙ
be I ame called Orthone. Orthone quod the
knyght / the ſeruyce of a clerke is lytell profyte
for the / He wyll putte the to / to moche payne if
thou beleue hym. I pray the leaue hym &amp; come
and ſerue me / &amp; I ſhall gyue the good thanke.
Orthone was redy to aunſwere / for he was in
amouts with the knyght and ſayde. Woldeſt
thou fayne haue my ſeruyce? yea truely quod
the knyght / ſo thou do not hurte to any perſone
in this houſe. No more I wyll do quod Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon
for I haue no power to do any other yuel
but to awake the out of thy ſlepe or ſome other
Well quod the knyght do as I tell the / and we
ſhall ſoone agree / and leaue the yuell clerke for
there is no good thyng in him / but to put the to
payne / therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e and ſerue me. well ꝙ orthon
and ſythe thou wylte haue me we are agreed.</p>
            <p>SO this ſpyrite Orthone loued ſo the
knight / that often tymes he wolde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
and vyſite hym / whyle he laye in his
bedde a ſlepe / and outher pull hym by the care
or els ſtryke at his chambre dore or wyndowe / 
to awake hym. And whan the knyght awoke
than he wolde ſaye. Orthon let me ſlepe. Nay
quod Orthone that wyll I nat do / tyll I haue
ſhewed the ſuche tidynges as are fallen a late.
The lady the knyghtes wyfe wolde be ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:22067:53"/>
that her heer wolde ſtande vp / and hyde
her ſelfe vnder the clothes. Than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e the knight
wolde ſaye. Why / what tidynges haſte thou
brought me? Quod Orthone / I am come out
of Englande or out of Hungry / or ſome other
place / and yeſterdaye I came thens / and ſuche
thynges are fallen or ſuche other. So thus the
lorde of Coraſſe knewe by Orthon euery thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
that was done in any parte of the worlde.
And in this caſe he contynued a fyue yere and
coude nat kepe his owne counſayle / but at laſte
diſcouered it to the erle of Foiz / I ſhall ſhewe
you howe.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſte yere the lorde of Coraſſe
came on a daye to Orthayſe to the

or in any other countrey. and euer the erle
of Foiz founde his ſayeng true / and had great
marueyle howe he ſhulde knowe ſuche thyngꝭ
ſo ſhortly. And on a tyme therle of Foiz examy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
hym ſo ſtraitly / that the lorde of Coraſe ſhe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed
hym all toguyder howe he knewe it / and
howe he came to hym firſte. Whan the Erle of
Foiz herde that he was ioyfull and ſayd. Sir /

thriſe he wolde come and vyſite the lorde of Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raſſe /

any thyng that was fallen fro whens he came.
And euer the lorde of Coraſſe whan he knewe
any thynge / he wrote therof euer to the Erle of
Foiz / who had great ioy therof / for he was the
lorde of the worlde that mooſt deſyred to here
newes out of ſtraunge places. And on a tyme
the lorde of Coraſſe was with the erle of Foiz /

the nexte mornynge the lorde a roſe and yſſued
out of his chambre and went to a wyndowe / &amp;
loked downe in to the courte of the caſtell / and
caſte about his eyen. And the firſte thynge he
ſawe was a Sowe / the greatteſt that euer he
ſawe / and ſhe ſemed to be ſo leane and yuell fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured / 
that there was nothyng on her but the
ſkynne &amp; the bones / with long eares and a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge

of that leane Sowe / and was wery of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſight of her / and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his men to fetche
his houndes / and ſayd. Lette the dogges hunt
her to dethe / and deuoure her. His ſeruauntes
opyned the kenelles and lette out his houndes / 
and dyde ſette them on this ſowe. And at the
laſte the ſowe made a great crye / and loked vp
to the lorde of Coraſſe as he loked out at a wyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dowe / 
and ſo ſodaynely vanyſſhed awaye no
man wyſte howe. Than the lorde of Coraſſe
entred in to his chambre right penſyue: &amp; than
he remembred hym of Orthon his meſſangere

abydynge for the duke of Lancaſtre who

knewe ryght well the grete mayſter of ſaynt

            <p>TRewe it was that before theſe ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dours
were comen into Englonde the
duke of Lancaſtre / and the erle of Cambrydge
his broder had dyuers counſayles togyder for
the ryght they claymed by theyr wyſtes. The
Erle of Cambrydge as ye haue herde before / 
was not well contente with kynge Ferant of
Portyngale nor with the men of warre there / 
for they had lodged .xv. dayes in the feldes be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caſtellyans / and yet kynge Ferant nor
the Portyngales wolde neuer fyght with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
yet the erle the ſame tyme ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynge his

of poore Englyſſhe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a .C. ſperes &amp; a .M.
archers. And al we are wyllyng to fyght with
our enemyes / and to abyde the aduenture that
god wyll ſende vs / but kynge Ferant anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
euer that he was not counſayled to fyght / 
wherfore when the Erle ſaw that he departed
thens / and toke with hym agayne his ſone out
of Portyngale / and when he was departed / 
then the kynge of Portyngale accorded with
kynge Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Caſtell / &amp; maryed his dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
to hym to make the peas / and this treatye
was made by ſyr Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Audre a knyght of por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyngale.
The kynge there had all his truſt in
hym. The kynge of Portyngale demaunded
of his doughter whether ſhe had rather haue
the kynge of Caſtel / or the erle of Cambrydge
ſone. She anſwered and ſayd howe ſhe loued
better Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Englonde then Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Caſtel
The kynge demaunded why ſhe ſayd ſoo / ſhe
anſwered / bycauſe Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Englonde was a
goodly perſonage and of her age / &amp; that was
the cauſe ſhe wolde not haue the kynge of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell / 
howbeit her fader to haue peas with the
Spanyardes made that maryage. Alſo the
erle had ſayd to the duke of Lancaſtre his bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
that kynge Ferant ones deed / he doubted
that the comons of the royalme of Portyngale
wolde rebell agaynſt the lady Beautryce / for
the mooſt parte of the royalme (For al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr
kynge had maryed her moder the lady Elya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure
of Coygne.) yet they helde not the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
doughter to be borne in lawfull maryage
but reputed her as a baſtarde / and mermured
theron whyle the erle was there. Wherfore he
was the gladder to take away his ſone thens.
The duke of Lancaſtre to whom y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched
nerer then to the erle of Cambrydge by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had maryed the eldeſt ſyſter heyre to
Caſtell / and he had a fayre chylde by the lady
Conſtaunce his wyfe / wherfore he euer deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be truely and iuſtly enfourmed of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynes
in thoſe partyes / and dyd ſet his mynde
howe he myght exalte and further his tytle / &amp;
he ſawe clerely that as then he coulde not haue
ſo good an entre in to Caſtell as by the royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of Portyngale / ſpecyally ſeynge howe he
was deſyred and requyred of the kyng of Por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyngale / 
and of the barons and comons of the
royalme / &amp; alſo conſyderynge howe the kynge
of Portyngale that was then was a noble ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
prynce and valyaunt / ſeynge howe he had
dyſcomfyted the kynge of Caſtel in playne ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayle
and all his puyſſaunce / Wherby the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoner enclyned to go in to Portyngale.
And alſo the kynge of Englonde and his coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayle

to the crowne of Portyngale / and alſo of the

this entente on a daye the duke made a dyner
to theſe ambaſſadours of Portyngale in his

man to departe / &amp; called theſe ambaſſadours
to hym ryght amorouſly / and demaunded of

that Laurence Fougaſe coulde ſpeke / 
Frenſſhe the duke addreſſed his wordes vnto

ſhall do me a grete pleaſure / ſyr ſayd y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſquyer
I ſhall fulfyll your pleaſure / and then began

            <p>Syrſyth the departure of your broder the

ſtablyſſhed / but and god had not wrought
by his grace the matter had gone euyll / and
all thrughe the defaulte of kynge Ferrant laſt
dyſſeaſed. This is the oppynyon of the mooſt
parte of the royalme / for kynge Ferrant in his
dayes loued ſore a lady wyfe to a knyght of
his called ſyr Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Laurence of Coygne / and
bycauſe of her beautye he wolde haue her by
force. The lady withſtode the kynges deſyre
as longe as ſhe myght / but at the laſte he had
her and ſayd. Dame I ſhall make you quene
of Portyngale / for thoughe I loue you / it is
not for your hurte / but to exalte you / for I wyl
mary you. Then the lady on her knees wepyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
ſayd / ſyr ſauynge your dyſpleaſure. I can
haue none honour to be quene of Portyngale
for you knowe and ſo doth all the worlde that

this .v. yere / Elyanoure ſayd the kynge make
none eſcuſe / for I wyll haue none other wyfe
but you / but I ſhall quyte you from your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande
or I mary you. The lady coulde gete
none other wordes of the kynge / and ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
all the matter to her huſbande / and when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
knyght knewe therof / he was ſory and malen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eolyous / 
and regarded and ſtudyed what we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
beſt for hym to do / and ſayd to hymſelfe / I
wyll not thus leue my wyfe / howbeit he doub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
the kynge / and wente out of the royalme

who receyued hym / and reteyned hym to be of
his houſe as longe as he lyued / and ſoo dothe
kynge Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that nowe is. Thus the kynge
of Portyngale to accomplyſſhe his folyſſhe
pleaſure / ſente for the knyght and for the lady
but the knyght was goone. Then the kynge
ſente for the byſſhophe of Connymbres / who
was as then chauncelloure of Portyngale / 
and of the kynges counſayle / and the kynge
ſhewed hym his entent / how he wolde wedde
Elyanoure of Coygne / and the byſſhop fered

Cytees in Portyngale / and had as moche ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure
and reuerence as euer hadde ony other
quene in the royalme of Portyngale / and the
kynge had by her a doughter / who as nowe is
quene of Caſtell. True it was that whyle kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
Ferant lyued / he ſente on a day / to Lyxbone
for all the prelates and noble men of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey / 
and for the counſayles of the Cytees / por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes / 
and townes of Portyngale / and this was
or your broder the erle of Cambrydge came in
to Portyngale / and there the kynge made eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry

Beautryce / Who was as then but fyue ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

wolde neuer agree / but had rather dye then to
be vnder the ſubiectyon of the royalme of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell.
¶For as yet the royalme of Portyngale
and the royalme of Caſtell neuer loued parfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
togyder / But hathe often tymes haryed / 
and made warre eche with other / In lykewy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe

            <p>THen the duke of Lancaſtre demaunded

<pb facs="tcp:22067:65"/>
Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that nowe is broder to kynge Ferrant
was in kynge Ferrantes dayes. Syr ſayd the
ſquyer he was in the royalme of Portyngale
in a houſe of relygyon wherin be knyghtes of
an ordre in whyte habytes with a reed croſſe
and he was ſouerayne of that houſe / and was
called mayſter Deuyce. The kynge ſet lytell

of Denyce / nor alſo kynge Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that nowe

had thought ony thynge of that is fallen ſyth
he loued his lady Elyanoure &amp; the lady Beau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tryce
her doughter / he wolde haue ſlayne his

that he kepte his houſe with the bretherne
of his ordre ſo mekely and duely he had no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte

ſyr as for the dyſſencyon that is nowe bytwe-Portyngale
and Caſtell / ſurely ſyr to ſaye the
trouthe therin / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spanyardes are cauſe ther
of / Why ſo ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke / I ſhall ſhewe you ſayd
the ſquyer. The Caſtellyans when they ſawe
that kynge Ferrant had maryed his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to theyr kynge / then they began to be prow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de / 
and began to ſpeke grete wordes / whiche
ſore greueo the Portyngales / for the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
wolde ſay. Oye Portyngales rude peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
lyke beeſtes / The tyme nowe is come that
we ſhall haue a good market of you / for ye ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
ben and ſhall be ours / we ſhall deuyde and
ſet you in companyes as we do the Iues who
dwelleth by truage vnder vs / ye ſhall be our
ſubiectes with other venymous wordes / often
tymes they ſayd thus when they met the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyngales.
And whyle kynge Ferrant lyued / &amp;
had maryed his doughter in to Caſtell / they
engendred ſuche an hate that they murmured
and ſayd / it were better to be deed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
the daunger and ſubieccyon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caſtelly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans / 
and ſo kynge Ferrant fell ſyke whiche en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dured
a hole yere. And when he was deed and
buryed in the chyrche of ſaynt Fraunce a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygyous
houſe of freers in the cyte of Lyxbone
Then the cytees / good townes / and caſtelles
in Portyngale cloſed theyr gates / &amp; they ſente
for the kynge that nowe is to Lyxbone / who
knewe ryght well the ententes of the .iii. other
cytees / as Connymbres / Porte / and Eure.
Then they ſayd. Mayſter Deuyce (ſo he was
called as then) We wyll make you kynge of
this royalme thoughe ye be a baſtarde / but we
ſay that your coſyn the lady Beautryce quene
of Caſtell is borne rather a baſterde than you
for as yet lyueth her moders fyrſt huſbande. /
And ſyth it is ſo that the crowne of Portynga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le

the mooſt profytable / and alſo the mooſt parte
of the royalme enclyneth to make you our kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge / 
and that the crowne of Portyngale ſhall
not go to a woman / nor we wyll not be vnder
the ſubieccyon of the kynge of Caſtell / nor of

all that we haue / to ayde and to maynteyne vs

Denyce who is as nowe kynge wolde not

there were many fayre dedes of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
done / ſo that by force the Englyſſhe men
were fayne to recule backe / for they were ſoo
wel reſyſted that they coulde gete no grounde
on them / ſo that they were clene beten out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
baylles / and ſo as on that day they coulde not
wyn it agayne. And at another corner of theyr
baſtydes they had a towre of ſtone deſcendyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
downe from a rocke / whiche the Bretons
helde to theyr aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage for kepynge of theyr
baſtydes. Therat was made a grete aſſaulte
with archers and other in the meane ſeaſon
whyle the other men of armes were fyghtyng
at the barryers / and there the Englyſſhe men
paſſed ouer a lytell dyke that was there / and
ſo came to the foote of the towre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pycke axes

to myne ſore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towre / and ſuche as were with

but the Englyſſhe archers ſhotte ſoo hooly
togyder that none durſt appere at theyr defen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce

of the towre that it raue clene in ſondre / &amp;
the one parte fel downe / and they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were with

them all in to the parte that ſtode. Then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glyſſhe
men made a grete ſhowte / and by that
tyme it was late / then they ſowned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> retrayte
for they ſayd they had done ynoughe for that
daye. So then the Englyſſhe men departed &amp;
ſayd to the Bretons / ſyrs abyde there al nyght

            <p>THe entente of the Englyſſhe men was

all ſuche as were within them / whiche was ry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ght

So thus the Englyſſhe men paſſed the nyght

what thynge myght auayle them / &amp; what thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge

that they bare to hym was for the voyage that
the erle of Buckyngham hadde made thrughe
Fraunce to come in to Bretayne / wenynge to
haue founde the duke there and countrey open
agaynſt them / as the duke of Bretayne hadde
promyſed / whiche the Englyſſhe men founde
contrary. ¶Alſo he ſawe well howe the kynge
of Englande hadde not wryten vnto hym ſoo
amyably as he hadde done often tymes before.
And ſpecyally as he hadde done before the erle
of Buckynghams voyage. ¶And alſo he dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bted

Iohan of Bretayne to the entente to make
hym warre. ¶Thenne the duke caſt his yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynacyon

And to doo his entente ſoo ſecretly that the En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glyſſhe

not in commaundynge his men of Bretayne
on payne of leſynge of theyr herytage not to go
in to Englande / nor to ayde the frenſſhe partye
this he dyd not / but he ſhewed outwardly that
the warre was for hym / but he dyd his entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſe
more couertly / he caſte in his ymagyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon
that he myght not doo more honourably / 
nor more to his profyte / then to take the conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Fraunce pryſoner or elles to ſlee hym / 
therby he knewe well he ſholde pleaſe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyſſhe
men / for they hated hym / for he thought
yf he were out of the waye he cared not for the
reſydue of his lygnage / for he knewe well they
were not able to make hym warre / for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable

from the cyte of Angyers to Towres in Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne.
And I laye on a nyght at Beauforte in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Bretayne called ſyr Wyllyam Daucemys / he
was rydynge to ſe my lady of Mayll in Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne
his coſyne &amp; her chyldren / she was newly

and ſpecyally of the takynge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable / 
whiche matter I was glad to here and
to knowe the trouth therof / and he ſhewed me &amp;
ſayd howe he had ben at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parlyament at wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde of Aucemys his coſyne a grete

In lyke maner this knyght ſhewed me ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny

Mounte le herry and Premylly was .iiii. grete

he ſhewed me many thynges / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche I bare
well in my remembraunce / and ſpecyally of the

&amp; that we came nere to Premylly / we entred in

A god haue mercy of the ſoule of the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable

            <p>In the ſeaſon whan Charles the great rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted

as we rede and fynde in the auncyent cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

in the worlde is knowen by writyng / for
we haue nothyng to ſounde vpon trouthe nor

was in Spayne diuers tymes / and at one
tyme he was ſtyll there a .ix. yere / without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tournyng
in to Fraunce / but ſtyll went forthe
on his conqueſt. In the ſame ſeaſon the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was
a kyng ſarazyn called Aquyn / he was kyng of

for Spaygne is a great countrey / begyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyng

All theſe be incloſed within Spayne / &amp; other.
And this great kyng Charlemayne / co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querid
all theſe countreis. And in this ſeaſon that the
kyng taryed there ſo longe / this kyng Aquyn
of Bougy in Barbary / aſſembled his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and
came by ſee in to Bretaygne / and arryued at
the porte of Wannes / and he hadde there with
hym his wyfe and chyldren / and there he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
and went forwarde. Kynge Charles
was well enfourmed of this viage / and howe
kynge Aquyn proſpered in Bretayne / but for
all that he wolde nat breke his vyage / &amp; ſayd.
Lette hym alone in Bretaygne / it ſhalbe but
a ſmall mater to delyuer the countrey of hym
and of his. Whan we haue ones <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ubdued his
countrey here / and brought it in to the holy
faythe. This kynge Aquyn buylded a towre
by the See ſyde: nat farre of fro Wannes / a
goodly and a fayre towre / and it was called
Glaye / And there this kynge Aquyn lay mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.
And whan kyng Charles had accompliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
his vyage / and acquyted all Galyce and
Spaygne from all the myſcreantes / and the
kynges Sarazyns deed and ſlayne / and all
the lande tourned to the Chriſten faythe. than
he retourned in to Bretaygne / and on a daye
hadde a great batayle agaynſt this kynge A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quyne / 
and nyghe all the myſcreantes ſlayne.
And ſo this kynge Aquyne fledde in to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
of Glaye / and there he hadde redy at the
foote of the towre a ſhyppe / and therin he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred / 
and his wyfe and his chyldren. But he
and his wyfe made ſuche haſte he was ſo nere
chaſed / that they hadde no leyſar to take with
them a yong ſonne that laye and ſlepte in the
towre / of a yere olde. Thus the kynge and
his wyfe departed by the ſee / and this chylde
was founde in the towre of Glaye / and was
brought to kynge Charlemaygne / who was
right ioyouſe of hym and ſaid / howe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chylde
ſhulde be baptyſed / and ſo he was: and Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
&amp; Olyuer helde hym ouer the fonte / and
was named Olyuer. And the kyng gaue him
all the landes that his father Aquyn had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.
This chylde whan he came to the age
of a man was a good knight / and his men cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
hym ſir Olyuer de Glaye aquyn / bycauſe
he was founde in the towre of Glaye / &amp; ſome
to the kynge Aquyn.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue ſhewed you the firſte fouu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacyon
of ſir Bertram of Cleſquyn / who ſhul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
be called Glaye aquyne. And ſir Bertram
in his dayes / after the puttynge out of kynge
Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peter of Caſtyle / and had crowned kyng
Henry / ſayde howe he wolde go in to Bougy
to demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de his herytage / And without fayle
ſo he had done / for kyng Henry had lent hym
men and ſhyppes to go in to Bougye with a
great armye / if a great lette had nat broken
his voyage. And that was whan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e the prince
of Wales made warre vpon the ſayde kynge
Henry / and dyde put hym downe / and by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſaunce
dyde ſette in to Caſtyle agayne Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter.
And than at the batayle of Marres ſir
Bertram was taken priſonner by ſir Iohan
Chandos / and was ſette to raunſome at a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="civ" facs="tcp:22067:117"/>
thouſande frankes. And at another tyme
he was alſo taken at the batayle of Alroy / and
raunſomed agayne / at a hundred thouſande
Frankes. So thus ſir Bertrams purpoſe
was brokenne / for the warres bytwene En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande
and Fraunce was renewed / So that
they hadde ynoughe to do. Thus he was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially
diſcended fro the kynge of Bougy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Aquyne / whoſe kyngdome is in Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye.
Thus I haue ſhewed you the ryght diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente
of ſir Bertram of Cleſquyn / I thanked
hym / and ſo we came to the towne of Prinul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.

            <p>Theſe lordes of Fraunce thought ſurely to

Than wyne and ſpyces were brought in / and
ſo made collaſyon / and than toke their leaue
and departed to their lodgynge. The nexte
daye they were apoynted to come to the duke / 
and ſo they dyde / and the duke receyued them
ſwetely and at the laſte ſayd. Sirr / I knowe

done nothynge to ſir Olyuer of Cleſquyne /

thynge / and that is / That he hadde ſo good a

ſaued his lyfe / was for the loue of his offyce /

ſoo many diſpleaſures / that I ought to hate
hym deedly. And ſauynge the diſpleaſure of
the kyng and of his vncles / and his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle.
For all the takynge of ſir Olyuer / I haue nat
therby broken their voyage by the ſee. I wyll
well excuſe my ſelfe therin / for I thought non
yuell the daye that I toke hym / a man ought
to take his ennemy wherſoeuer he fynde hym
And if he were deed / I wolde thynke the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme
of Fraunce to be as well ruled or better / 
than it is by his counſayle. And as for his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelles
that I holde / the whiche he hath dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
me / I am in poſſeſſyon of them / and ſo
wyll be / withoute the puyſſaunce of a kynge
take them fro me. And as for rendringe of his
money / I aunſwere / I haue had ſo moche to
do in tyme paſte / by the meanes of this ſir O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer
of Clyſquyn / that I ranne in dette gret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
therby: and nowe I haue payde them that
I was bounde vnto / by reaſon of this dette.
This was the anſwere that the duke of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taygne
made to the kynges ambaſſadours / 
Than they layde forthe other reaſons / to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the duke to ſome reaſonable waye / but
all his anſweres tourned euer to one conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon.
And whan they ſawe none other waye / 
they toke their leaues to departe / and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke
gaue them leaue. Than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e they retourned and
dyd ſo moch by their iourneys that they came
to Parys / to the houſe of Beautie / beſyde
Wynſentes. There was the kyng &amp; the quene
and thyder came the duke of Berrey and the

and they ſayde / howe the duke was a

the mater ſhulde nat ſo reſte in peace / ſeynge
the matter ſo preiudyciall for the Crowne of

nat putte hym to dethe / whan he hadde hym

a longe ſeaſon / and the duke of Bretayne laye

thoughe he had had opyn warre / and was in
many imaginacions on the dede he had done
Somtyme he wolde ſay / he wolde he had nat

a man ſayd / that elles he wolde neuer haue

a lytell and ſayde. A Triuylen Triuylien / 
youre buſyneſſe is nouther fayre nor good. ye

power and with youre yuell counſayle / the
kyng / and dyuers other nobles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme.
Alſo ye haue moued certayne good townes
agaynſt vs. Nowe is the daye come that ye
ſhall haue your payment / for he that dothe
well by reaſon ſhulde fynde it. Thynke on
youre buſyneſſe / for I wyll nother eate nor

abaſſhed Triuylen / for gladlye there is no
man wolde here of his ende. He wolde fayne
haue excuſed hym ſelfe with fayre language / 
in lowly humblyng hym ſelf / for he coude do
nothyng to apeaſe the duke / for he was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fourmed
of hym / and of other of the duke of
Irelandes ſecte / that nothyng aueyled hym.
Where to ſhulde I make lengar the mater / 
ſir Robert Triuylien was delyuered to the

and there beheeded / and after ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged on a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.
Thus ended ſir Robert Triuylien.

to the duke that the kyng of Portugale apro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched

the kynge was within two leages / the duke
with his knyghtes mounted on their horſes

was / that they ſhulde ryde togyder and
enter in to the countrey of Campe and to go

they wyſt nat how to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ryuer of Derne
whiche was fell and orgulous at certayne ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes /

for whan the ſnowe and froſte melteth on
the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayns by reaſon of the ſonne / than is
the ryuer mooſt depeſt &amp; moſt dangerous to
paſſe / for in wynter it is froſyn / &amp; than the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

concluded to ryde in to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre of Campe / 
truſtyng at ſome place to fynde ſome paſſage
This concluſyon was publyſſhed throughe
all their hooſtes / wherof euery man was ioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full / 
for they had lyen along ſpace ſore oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
and in great daunger at Auranche &amp; ther
about / and many were ſore diſeaſed.</p>
            <p>Thus the kyng of Portugale and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> duke
of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>caſtre departed fro Auranche and rode
toguyder / but their hoſtes were ſeperated in

that myght haue fallen bytwene them / 
for portugales are hote &amp; haſtye / and in lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Englyſſhmen be diſpytefull and fierſe.
Thus they were apoynted by the man hals
of bothe hoſtes to lodge and to forrage in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
partes / and nat toguyder. Thus they
rode forthe and were of chat. puyſſaunce able
to fyght for a iourney with kynge Iohan of

they iourneyed that they came to they ryuer
of Derne / whiche was nat eaſy to paſſe / for it

who was conſtable of the Englyſſhe hooſt / 
and the marſhalles / ſir Richarde Butle and
ſir Thomas Moreaulx / and their forragers
as they rode before / they encountred a ſquier
of Caſtell / called Donnage Bangher. He
knewe well all the paſſages of the countrey / 
and he knewe where there was one paſſage / 
that bothe horſmen and fote men might eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
paſſe the riuer / &amp; he came ouer at the ſame
paſſage / and was taken and brought to the
ſayd lordes / of whom they were ryght glad.
And there he was ſo ſtreitly examyned / &amp; alſo
by the wordes of the conſtable / who ſayde to
hym / howe he wolde quyte his rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſome and
gyue hym a good rewarde if he wolde ſhewe
them where they myght paſſe ſurely the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer / 
for they ſayde they had herde howe there
was one ſure paſſage ouer the ryuer. The
ſquyer who toke but lyght aduyſement / and
was couetous of the conſtables offre / &amp; was
gladde to be delyuered out of their handes / 
ſayd. Sirs / I knowe well the paſſage / and
I ſhall ſhewe it you and ſhalbe your guyde
where as ye and all youre menne maye paſſe
without any daunger.</p>
            <p>Of this the conſtable and marſhalles had

<pb n="cxvi" facs="tcp:22067:129"/>
worde of this tydinges to the duke of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre /

Than the ſpanyſſhe ſquyer entred firſte in to
the ryuer / &amp; ſhewed them the way. And whan
they ſawe the paſſage ſo pleaſaunt they were
ryght ioyfull / and ſo euery man paſſed ouer.
And whan the vowarde was ouer / they lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
there to gyue knowledge to all other that
folowed after. Than the conſtable kepte his
promyſe with the ſquyer that was their gyde.
And ſo he departed fro them and rode to Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dena
del campo / where the kynge of Caſtyle
lay / a good towne in the countrey of Campe.
Than the kynge of Portugale and the duke
of Lancaſtre came to the paſſage / which was
called Plaſce ferarde / bycauſe the grauell and
ſande there was firme and ſtable / and without
parell. There they and their hooſtes paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer / 
and the next day the rerewarde / and than
they all lay in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of Campe. Tydin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
came to them of Ruelles / of Cateſeris / of

a right valyant man / called the lorde Fitz wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter:
He was greatly bemooned / but agaynſt

&amp; other places: &amp; in euery place they were
welcome and brought to their lodgynges / &amp;
their names preſented to the capitayne. The
greatteſt parte of the gentylmen went to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent / 
bycauſe in that towne there were many
ſtraungers / Bretons / frenchmen / normayns
<pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:22067:132"/>
and poicteuyns / ouer whome ſir Olyuer de

            <p>THus as I haue ſhewed you / the duke
of Lancaſtres army brake vp at that
tyme in Caſtyle / and euery man ſought the

taryed there four dayes: And than departed
with all his men / and retourned to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to his wyfe / who laye at Porte / a good
cytie in Portugale.</p>
            <p>NOwe ſhall I ſhewe you what befell
of dyuers knyghtes and ſquyers / ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
as were departed fro the duke and gone
in to Caſtile. Dyuers that were entecte with
ſickeneſſe / for all their chaungynge of newe
ayre and newe medycins / yet they coulde nat
ſcape the peryll of dethe. Dyuers dyed in Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pent / 
in the meane ſeaſon that the king of Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtyle
ſent to the kynge of Nauerre and to the
frenche kyng for their ſaueco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ductes / to paſſe
peſably (whiche was nat ſoone optaygned)
dyuers lordes / knyghtes / and ſquyers of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
dyed in their beddes whiche was gret
domage / and a great loſſe to their countrey.
In Arpent there dyed thre great barones of
Englande / and ryche men. The firſt was ſir
Richarde Burle who had ben marſhall of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
dukes hooſt / another the lorde Ponynges / &amp;
the thyrde the lorde Percy / coſyn germayne
to the erle of Northumberlande. And in the
towne of Noy dyed ſir Mauberyn of Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
a poyteuyn / a ryght noble and an expert
knyght. And in the towne of Ruelles there
dyed a great baron called the lorde Talbot:
So that there died here and there a .xii. gret
lordes / and a fourſcore knightes / and two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred

without any ſtroke ſtryken / and there
dyed of other meane men / mo than fyue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
And I herde it reported of a knyght of

(his name was ſir Thom<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Quynbery) that

            <p>THe duke of Lancaſtre fyll in a pery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

Iaques / and often tymes the brute
ranne in Caſtyle &amp; in Fraunce howe he was

of his lyfe. Thyrrey of Souuayne a ſquyer
of honour / and ſquyer for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dukes body was
taken with ſickeneſſe and dyed at Beſances / 
he was naturally borne of the countie of Hey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naulte.
And his brother Wyllyam of Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayn

and he was yonge &amp; luſty and tooke no hede

ſo that by gambaldyng of the horſe the impo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtume
brake in his body / and whan he was
retourned to his lodgynge he was layde on

            <p>This was the cauſe that ſuche as owed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

Guerles is no riche countre / nor ſo great as

and haunted iuſtes and tourneys to his gret
coſt / to gette hym renome. And euery yere he
ſpended four tymes as moche as the value of
the reuenewes of his landes. He borowed of
the lombardes in dyuers places / he was ſo
lyberall and outragious: He ran ſo in dette / 
that he coulde nat ayde hym ſelfe with any
thynge that he had / ſo that his parentes and
frendes greatly blamed hym / and ſpeciallye
an vncle of his by his mothers ſyde / He came
of the houſe of Orcle / and was archebyſſhop
of Coleygne / who ſayd to hym in maner of
gyueng hym counſayle. My fayre nephewe
Raynolde / ye haue ſo demeaned youre ſelfe / 
that nowe ye are become a poore manne / and
your la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des lyeth in pledge in dyuers places.
And throughe all the worlde there is but ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell

you that ſuche as haue hadde theſe great gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

I be byſſhoppe of Coleyne / that I ought to

Surely I wyll nat do it / nor my conſcy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence?

nat ſo moche as a poore lordſhyppe. This

The duke made no compte therof / for he had
nat wherwith to redeme them agayne. &amp; the
erle of Mors ſawe that he came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of
Brabant / &amp; treated with hym to haue agayn
his money for the ſayde caſtelles. The duke
herde hym well / bycauſe the caſtels marched

thre caſtelles. And in the firſt he ſet the lorde
of Kalle / to be as chefe ſouerayne. and whan
this duke of Guerles was deed / than ſir Ed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde
of Guerles toke on hym the herytage
and ſent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Brabant ambaſſadors / 
deſyring hym that he might haue agayne the
thre caſtelles / for the money that was payde
for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The duke wolde make no ſuche bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne / 
but denyed it. With whiche anſwere
ſir Edwarde of Guerles was nat content / &amp;
dalte hardely with the wydowe the lady Iſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bell
of Brabant / yonger ſuſter to the duches / 
whiche lady had wedded the duke Raynolde
of Guerles. but thus he troubled her for her
dowrie. The lady wente in to Brabant and
complayned her to the duke of Brabant her
brother and to the ducheſſe / howe that ſir Ed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde
of Guerles dyde her great wronge &amp;
iniury. And bycauſe there was a grudge by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
the Brabanſoys and the guerloys / for
the lande and towne of Grance / whiche was
in Brabant on that ſyde the ryuer of Mueſe
Therfore the duke and the brabanſoys were
more enclyned to ayde the lady. and on a day
there were aſſembled togyder at the callyng
of the duke of Brabant a great no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of men
of warre / a .xii. hundred ſpeares. And ſir Ed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde
of Guerles made his aſſemble on the

likely to haue had a batayle bytwene them.
But the duke Aubert / the duke of Mours / &amp;
the duke of Iullyers mette togyder by a trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie / 
and ſo this aſſemble departed a ſondre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

And the Emperour gaue hym a great

gaue hym the ſouerayntie of the good &amp;

Marques of the holy Empyre / to augment
therby his eſtate. And ſurely he coulde nat
gyue hym to moche / for this Duke Wynce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
was lyberall / ſwete / courteſſe / amyable / 
and noble in armes: &amp; was likely to atchyue
many thynges if he hadde lyued long / but he
dyed in the floure of his youthe. Wherof I
that haue written this hyſtorie make great

but tyll he was a .xxiiii. yere of age. Theſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſme
that was in the churche greatly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
hym / and that he ſhewed me often tymes
for I was priue of his acquayntau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. in that
in my dayes I traueyled a great parte of the

two princes were in my dayes / and wereful
of humilyte / larges / and bountie: without

They had therat indygnacion and

Almayne / by the landes and daungers of the
duke of Iulyers and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Guerles. And
ſoo it was / that certayne robbers were in the
wayes of Linfars. And it were they that had
done the vyolence and paſſynge through the
landes of the duke of Iuliers. It was ſhewed
me that the duke had lente them horſe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels.
Great complayntes came to duke Wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celant
of Brabant and of Luzenbourge / who
as than was at Bruſelles / howe that the Lan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guefryde
wherof he was ſouerayne regarder

they that dyde that vyolence / and robbed the

(who as than was yonge and luſty / and puyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunte

diſpyte the offences that his people had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned

offence / whiche greatly toucheth and is preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyciall

The duke of Iulyers fayntely excuſed hym

ſir / ye knowe beſt your ſelfe. Well quod
the duke / and I ſaye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is my entenſyon that
I wyll nat ſlepe ſo in this blame / nor that it
ſhall be said that for ſlouth or faynte hert / that
I ſhulde ſuffre vnder my ſauegarde robbers
to do vilaynes and robories vnpunyſſhed. I
ſhewe and wyll ſhewe to my coſyn of Iuliers
and to his aydes / that this mater toucheth me
nere. This duke cooled nat his entent / but in
contynent ſet clerkes a warke / and ſent to them
that he thought wolde ayde hym. Some he
prayed / and ſome he commaunded / and ſente
ſufficyent knoledge of his mynde to the duke
of Iuliers and to his alies. bothe theſe lordes
made great preparacion. The duke of Iuly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
had but lytell ayde / but of his brother ſyr
Edwarde of Guerles / he greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted him
with men and with frendes. Theſe two lordes
ſent priuely for men farre in to Almayne. And
bycauſe that almayns are couetous / deſyring
to wynne / and it had bene longe before or they
were in any place / where they myght get any
good aduenture. They wolde haue come in
more habundaunce and they had nat knowen
that they ſhulde haue had to do agaynſte the
duke of Brabante. The duke of Brabante in
great aray departed fro Bruſelles / and went
to Louayne / and fro thence to Treete on the
ryuer of Mueſe / and there he founde a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
ſpeares abydinge for hym / and always
there came menne to hym fro all partyes / fro
Fraunce / fro Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders / fro Haynalt / fro Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure / 
fro Lorayne &amp; other countreys / ſo that
he had two thouſande and fyue hundred ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of good men of warre. and alſo there came
to hym out of Burgoyne the lorde of Graunt / 
and with hym a foure hundred ſpeares / but
they came to late / for they knewe nat the daye
of the buſyneſſe that I ſhall ſhewe you / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they were ſore dyſpleaſed / whanne they
herde that the mater was done without them.
The duke of Brabant beinge at Trect / herde
but lytell newes of his enemyes. Than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
fro Trect the wednyſdaye / and wente
and lodged in the lande of his enemyes / and
there lay all that nyght / and the thurſday tyll
he herde certayne tydynges. It was ſhewed
hym by his corours that his enemyes were a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brode.
Than he rode forwarde / and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to burne in the duke of Iuliers <abbr>land</abbr>/and
the thurſday toke his lodginge betymes. And
the vowarde kept the erle Guy of Ligney / erle
of ſaynt Pole and ſir Valeran his ſonne / who
as than was but yong / of a ſixtene yere of age / 
and there he was made knyght. The duke of
Iuliers came the ſame thurſday / and lay nere
one to another. and by all lyklyhode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> almay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
knewe the demeanour of the brabanſoys / 
better than they dyd theirs / for on the fridaye
<pb facs="tcp:22067:141"/>
betymes whan the duke of Brabant had herd
maſſe / and that all were in the felde &amp; thought
nat to haue fought ſo ſoone. Than came redy
the duke of Iuliers and ſir Edwarde of Guer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les
well mounted with a great batayle. Than
one ſayd to the duke of Brabante. ſyr / beholde
yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der your enemys put your helmes on your
heedes / in the name of god and ſaynt George.
Of that worde the duke had great ioye. The
ſame day he had by him four ſquiers of great
price / worthy to ſerue an hyghe prince and to
be aboute hym / for they had ſene many dedes
of armes. they were called Iohan de Valcon / 
Baudwyn of Beauforde / Gyrarde of Byes / 
and Roulande of Colongne. Aboute the duke
were the bruſelloys / ſome a horſebacke with
their varlettes behynde them / with botelles of
wyne truſſed at their ſadelles / and paſtyes of
ſamonde / troutes / and elys wraped in towels.
Theſe horſemen greatly combred the place / ſo
that there was ſuch preaſe that no man coude
ſtyrre. Than Gyrarde of Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

they ſhall greatly let vs / we can nat ſe aboute
vs nor haue knoledge of your reregarde / nor
vowarde / nor of your marſhall ſir Roberte of
Namure. So let it be quod the duke / I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
ſo. Than Gyrarde toke his glayue in
his handes and ſo dyd his companyons / and
began to ſtryke on their helmes and on their
horſes / ſo that a none the place was voyded of
them / for no man was glad to haue his horſe
ſlaine or hurte. Than the duke of Iuliers and
ꝓ Edwarde of Guerles &amp; their company came
on theym / and founde the erle of ſaynt Poule
and his ſonne in the vowarde / and daſſhed in
ſo ferſely amonge them / that anone they were
broken and diſcomfited / and there were many
ſlayne / taken / and hurte. that was the batayle
that had moſte to do. There was ſlayne Guy
the erle of ſaynte Poule / and ſir Valeran his
ſonne taken. The batayle tourned to a herde
parte for the duke of Brabante / and for them
that were with him. for of men of honour there
were but a fewe ſaued / but outher they were
ſlayne or taken / The duke of Brabante was
taken / and ſyr Roberte of Namure / and ſyr
Loys of Namure his brother / and ſir Willy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
of Namure ſonne to the erle of Namure / 
and many other. Alſo on the duke of Iulyers
parte there were ſome ſlaine and hurte. but ye
know well it is a generall rule / the great loſſe
euer reſteth on them that be diſconfyted. howe
be it for all the domage the duke of Brabante
had in that iourney / yet they hadde one great
poynte of remedy &amp; comforte / for ſir Edwarde
of Guerles was wounded to dethe. And this
I ſaye bycauſe it was the opinyon of dyuerſe / 
that if he had lyued he wolde haue rydden ſo
forwarde / that with puyſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he wolde haue
come to Bruſelles and conquered all the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treye / 
for none wolde haue reſyſted hym. He
was hardy and fierſe / and hated the braban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoys / 
bycauſe of the thre caſtels that they helde
agaynſt hym. This iourney and victory had
the duke of Iulyers in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yere of our lorde god / 
a thouſande thre hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred and a leuen / on ſaynt
Bartylmewes euyn / on a fridaye.</p>
            <p>THe duches of Brabant purchaſed her
frendes / and had counſayle of Charles
the frenche kyng / who was nephue to the duke
of Braba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an all his bretherne / for they were
chyldren of his ſuſter. ſhe was counſayled by
the kynge to go to the kynge of Almayne em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure / 
brother to the duke of Brabante / for
whoſe ſake the duke her huſbande had taken
all that domage. The lady dyd ſo and came to
Conualence on the ryuer of the Ryne / &amp; there
founde the Emperoure / And there wyſely ſhe
made her complaynte. The emperoure herde
her well / the whiche he was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vnto by dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſe
reaſons. The one bycauſe the duke was
his brother / and another bycauſe he had inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
hym to be his vycare / and ſouerayne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garder
of the Languefryde. he comforted the
lady and ſayd / that at the next ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer he wolde
fynde ſome remedy. The lady retourned into
Brabante well comforted. And the emperour
ſir Charles of Boeſme ſlept nat his buſynes / 
but waked the mater / as ye ſhall here. For as
ſoone as wynter was paſt he aproched to the
noble cytie of Coloyne / &amp; there made his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſion / 
in ſuche wyſe as though he wolde go
to conquere a realme of defence / and wrote to
his dukes &amp; erles that helde of hym / and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
them at the thyrde day of Iune they
ſhulde be with hym at Ayes / with fyfty horſe
a pece / on payne of leſyng of their landes. and
ſpecially he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded thre / as duke Auberte
erle of Haynalte / that he ſhulde come to Ayes
with fyfty horſe / and ſo he dyd. Whanne theſe
lordes were come / there was moche people.
And than ſyr Charles his ſonne ſayde that he
<pb n="cxxviii" facs="tcp:22067:141"/>
wolde go and entre in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> landes of duke Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyers
&amp; deſtroy it / bycauſe of the great outrage
that he had done / as in enteryng in to the felde
with an army againſt the emperours vycaire
his brother. this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was gyuen by playne
iudgement in the emperours chambre. Than
to that mater regarded the archebyſſhoppe of
Treues / the archbyſſhoppe of Coloyne / the
byſſop of Marauce / the byſſhoppe of Liege / 
the duke Aubert of Bauier / the duke Oſte his
brother / and diuerſe other barons of Almayne
(that thought) to dyſtroy the landes of ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyaunt
a knyght as was the duke of Iulyers / 
ſhulde be yuell done / and alſo he was nere of
their kynne. They ſayde it were better fyrſte
to ſende for hym / that he myght come to obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunce.
That apoyntment was holden for the
beſt / for the loue of bothe partyes. Than duke
Auberte and his brother came to Iuliers / and
<abbr>found</abbr> there the duke / who was abaſſhed / and
wyſte nat what counſayle to beleue / for it had
ben ſhewed him that the aſſemble that the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
had made was to come on hym / with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his frendes dyd ſtoppe it. Whan theſe lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
were come to the duke he was <abbr>gladd</abbr> / ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyally
by the comynge of his two coſyns ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns / 
the duke Aubert of Bauiers and the
duke Oſte his brother / for he knewe well that
they wolde nat his dyſhonoure / but rather to
gyue hym good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle / as they dyd. Their
counſayle was to ſhewe you breuely / that he
ſhulde ſende ſome honorable perſones for the
duke of Luſenburge and of Brabant / whome
he helde in curtoyſe priſon in his caſtell of Ni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deque / 
and ſo he dyd. And whan he was come
all thoſe lordes dyd hym great honour / as rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon
was. And than they all departed togyder / 
and came to Ayes and toke their lodgynges.
Than the duke Auberte and his brother / and
the foreſayd prelates / who were the meanes of
this treatye. they ſore entreated the emperour
and his counſayle / and ſhewed the emperoure
howe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Iuliers his coſyn / of his owne
free wyll was come to ſe hym / and to put hym
ſelfe poorely with out any reſeruacyon / into
his obeyſaunce and commaundement / and to
knowledge hym for his ſoueraygne and liege
lorde. Theſe ſwete and amyable wordes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefyed
greatly the emperours ire that he had
before. Than the emperoure ſayd. Lette the
duke come to me? and ſo he dyde / and kneled
downe before the emperoure and ſayde. My
ryght redoubted ſouerayne / I beleue well ye
are dyſpleaſed with me / bycauſe of your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in lawe the duke of Brabante / whome I
haue helde longe in priſon / for the which cauſe
I ſubmytte my ſelfe to abyde your ordre and
your counſayles. To that worde themperour
gaue none aunſwere / but his ſonne ſir Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les / 
who was called kynge of Boeſme / aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
and ſayde. Duke of Iulyers / ye haue
ben to outragyous to kepe our vncle ſo longe

duke Oſte of Bauyers / this buſyneſſe wolde
haue ben ſoer layd to your charge than it is / 
for ye haue well deſerued to be hyghly punyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
but chaunge your copye ſo that we haue
no cauſe to renew our yuell wylles agaynſte
you / for &amp; ye do it wyll be coſtly to you. Than
the duke of Iulyers beynge on his kne before
the emperoure (where as he ſate in his chayre
imperiall) ſayde. My ryght redoughted ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerayne
lorde / by your puyſſaunt hyghnes / I
knowledge my ſelfe to haue treſpaſſed youre
maieſte / in that I with an army came againſt
my coſyn your vycaire of the empyre / and in
that I haue helde hym as my priſoner / I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer
hym vnto you freely and quyte / and I
requyre your grace that you nor he beare me
any yuell wyll fro hence forthe. Than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
and the princes there beynge preſente / to
helpe forwarde his wordes ſayde. Ryght no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
prince this ſuffyſeth that your coſyn of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyers
hath ſayd. Well quod the emperour / we
are content / and ſo toke hym vp by the hande.
And as it was ſhewed me for the confyrmaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of more loue / he kyſt the duke on the mouth
and alſo his ſonne the kynge of Boeſme. And
than the duke of Brabante was delyuered out
of priſon / and all ſuche as were priſoners vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the duke of Iulyers / and were nat raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed
before / were delyuered quyte / by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the compoſycion of the treatie. and this
done euery manne retourned to their owne.
The emperour wente to Prage in Almayne / 
and the duke of Brabant in to Brabante / 
and whanne the duke of Brabante
was retourned / than he reyſed
a newe tayle in his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey
to reſtore to his knigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am yet wyllynge to
treate of this matter more
at lengthe / to renforce this
hyſtorye / and to brynge it
to the poynte that I wolde
come vnto. &amp; to declare the
trouthe / why Charles the
frenche kyng came with a great puyſſaunce in
to Almayne. I might haue ſhewed this before
but I haue prolonged it (for all thingꝭ though
the date and ſeaſon be paſte yet they ought to
be ſhewed in this hyſtory) for whan I knowe
that the frenche kynge and the kynge of <abbr>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</abbr>
began to be beſy / than I began to wake
to procede this hyſtory / more than I dyd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Therfore I ſaye thus. Whan duke Wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celant
was returned in to the countrey / &amp; clere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
delyuered out of perſon (as ye haue herde be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore)
Than he was in wyll to vyſyte his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
and caſtels / as well in the duchy of Luzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourge / 
as elſe where. and toke his iourney to
the good cytie of Straweſbourge / throughe
the lande of Fauquemount and behelde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thre
caſtels whiche were the occaſion of the duke of
Guerles yuell wyll. He founde theym ſtronge
and fayre / if he loued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before / he loued them
moche better than: and cauſed them to be new<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
fortyfied / and ſet workemen a worke / as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons / 
carpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters / and dykemakers / to amende
euery place. and at his departynge he ſet a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyaunt
knyght to be ſoueraygne keper of theſe
thre caſteles. This knyght was called ſir Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han
Groſſet / who at the dukes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
toke on hym the charge / at his parell.
The duke paſſed further and vyſited his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey / 
and at his pleaſure retourned agayne in
to Brabante / for there was his abydynge. In
this ſeaſon ſyr Iohan of Blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by right came to hym / by the deth of ſir
Edwarde of Guerles his brother / who was
ſlayne (as ye haue herde / in the batayle of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyers)
But his ſuſter the duches of Iulyers
ſtroue with hym and made chalenge / and the
moſte parte of the knightes and good townes

had a fayre ſonne / who was able than to ryde.
and that was well ſene / for always he was in
the warres / ſo that ſir Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de Bloyſe nor his

But the chalenge of the ryght of his wyfe and
the purſute therof / coſte hym aboue a hundred
thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de frankes. For the ſonne of duke Wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyam
of Iuliers ſhewed well in his youth that
he was noble and hardy / and loued dedes of

was duke of Guerles / and had in mariage the
eldeſt doughter of duke Auberte / who had ben
wedded before to ſir <abbr>Edward</abbr> of Guerles / but
he had neuer carnally coupyled with her / for
ſhe was to yonge. Thus ſhe was maryed to
the lorde Willyam of Iulyers / and he and ſhe
were moche of one age. And ſoo ſhe was ſtyll

increaſed in honour / wytte / and prowes / and
in great wyll to hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te dedes of armes / and to

               </gap>e was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

dyed duke of Boeſme / duke of Luſenbourge /

and thought than to get and recouer agayne
his thre caſtelles / bycauſe of the debate that
was and had ben bytwene Brabante and his

he ſente to treate with the duches of Brabant / 
<pb n="cxxix" facs="tcp:22067:142"/>
to delyuer his caſtelles / for the ſomme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
that they laye in pledge for / always af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmynge
howe they laye but in guage. The
lady anſwered the meſſangers how ſhe was
in poſſeſſyon of them / and helde them as her
owne ryght and enherytaunce. But bycauſe
ſhe wolde the duke ſhulde be a good neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to Brabaunte / that he ſhulde leaue and
gyue vp the towne of Graue / the whiche he
helde in the duchy of Brabant. Whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke
of Guerles had herde this aunſwere / he was
nothynge well contente: and thought great
diſpyte therof. And thought and ymagined
many thynges / and couertly he treated with
the knyght / called ſir Iohan of Groſſelotte / 
chiefe capitayne of the ſayde caſtelles / to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaye
if he coude gette them of hym / by byeng
for money / or otherwyſe. The knyght who
was trewe and ſage / wolde in no wyſe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
therto. And ſente to the duke / deſyringe
hym to ſpeke no more therof: For to dye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there ſhuld neuer faut be founde in hym
nor that he wolde conſente to do any trayſon
to his naturall lady. And whan the duke of
Guerles ſawe that (as I was enfourmed)
he dyde ſo moche to ſir Raynolde of Dyſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorte / 
that he toke for a ſmall occaſyon a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
agaynſt the knyght: So that on a
daye he was mette with all in the feldes / and
there ſlayne / wherwith the ducheſſe of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bante
was ſore diſpleaſed and ſo was all the
countre / and the caſtelles were putte in other
kepynge / by the agrement of the duches and
of the counſayle of Brabant.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus the matters ſtode certayne
yeres / and euer there noriſſhed
couert hate / what for the towne
of Graue on the one parte / and
for the thre caſtelles on the other
parte: Bytwene the duke of Guerles and the
duches of Brabant / and their countreis. and
they of the fronter of Guerles bare alwayes
yuell wyll couerlly againſt them of Brabant
ſuche as marched nere to them: and dyd euer
to them as moche dyſpleaſure as they coude
do / and ſpecially ſuche as were in the towne
of Graue. And bytwene the dukes woode
and the towne of Graue / there was but four
leages and a playne countrey / and fayre fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
to ryde in. And they of Guerles dyde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
there as great diſpyte to the braban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoys / 
as they myght. And the mater went ſo
forwarde / that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Guerles paſſed the
ſee / and went in to Englande to ſekyng Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde
his coſyn / and his other coſins: as the
duke of Lancaſtre / the duke of yorke / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke
of Gloceſtre / and other great barons of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande.
He had there good chere for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred
to ſe hym / &amp; to haue his acquayntaunce
for the Englyſſhe men knewe well that this
dukes herte / corage / ymaginacion / and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction / 
was rather Englyſſhe than Frenche.
In this vyage he made great alyaunce with
the kynge of Englande / and bycauſe at that
tyme he helde nothynge of the kynge of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande / 
wherby he ſhulde beare hym faythe / 
homage / or ſeruyce. Therfore kyng Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
gaue hym in pencyon out of his coffers / a
thouſande marke by yere: And was counſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
to aſſaye to gette his right fro the duches
of Brabant / and was promyſed to haue aide
of the Englyſſhe men / in ſuche wyſe / that he
ſhulde take no domage. And by this meanes
he ſware to be true and faithfull to the kyng / 
and to the realme of Englande. And whan
this alyaunce was made / he tooke his leaue
of the kynge and of his coſyns / and other ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rons
of Englande / And retourned in to his
owne countrey of Guerles: and ſhewed the
duke of Iulyers all that he hadde done / and
howe he ſhulde haue ayde and helpe of the
Englyſſhe men. And the duke of Iulyers / 
who by experyence of his age knewe farther
than the duke his ſonne dyde / made no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynaunce
of no great ioye: but ſayd. Sonne
Wyllyam / ye haue done ſo moche / that bothe
you and I maye fortune to repent youre go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng

For one Buffet that I ſhall receyue
I wyll gyue ſire. And alſo the kynge of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne

If nede be I ſhalle haue ayde of hym. Well

quod the duke of Iuliers. Wylliam my fayre
ſonne / I feare me ye wyll playe the fole / your

            <p>I ſhall ſhewe you why the duke of Iuly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſpake ſomwhat agaynſte the wyll of his

laſte diſceſſed before this ſeaſon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſpeke of
he dyde as moche as he coulde alwayes to
gette hym frendes on all partes / for it ſtode
hym in hande ſo to do / &amp; for all that he coude
nat do ſo moche as to make reſyſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt
his ennemyes. Howe be it he dyde as moche
as he coude by gyftes and fayre promyſes / to
ſytte in reſt and to haue ayde / ſo that he gate
hym ſelfe many frendes / in the Empyre and
other places. So that whan the duke of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyers
was quyte delyuered oute of priſone / 
and was come to the duke of Brabant. The
kynge and he were great frendes toguyder / 
and by the ordynau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Emperour of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
dyde ſette. The duke of Iulyers wente
to Parys to ſe the kynge / and there he was
nobly receyued / and great gyftes gyuen to
hym and to his knyghtes. And than he made
relefe to the kynge for the ſignorie of Vyer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon / 
whiche parteyned to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of Bloys
whiche lande laye bytwene Bloys and Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey / 
and was worthe by yere a fyue hundred

there the duke of Iulyers ſware y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhulde
neuer beare armure agaynſt the Crowne of

he kept his othe: For ſurely as long as kyng
Charles lyued he dyde hym no maner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage / 
nor conſented to none to be done to the
crowne of Fraunce. But whan kyng Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
was deed / &amp; that Charles his ſonne was
kynge. By reaſon of the warres of Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
(as it hath been ſhewed before in this
hyſtorie) And after he tooke his Creacyon
at Parys / He hadde ſo moche to do that he
coude nat take hede in euery place. The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Iulyers than came nat in to Fraunce / nor
made no relyefe for the landes of Vierſone.
Wherfore the duke of Berrey who toke hym
ſelfe as ſoueraygne / ſayde. Howe the relefes
parteyned to hym: And ſo ceaſed the landes
and toke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> profytes therof / and by puyſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
putte out fro his ryght the Erle of Bloyes:
Howe be it the ſame tyme I ſawe them bothe
oftentymes togyder / and neuer debate made
bytwene them for any of the ſayd landes / nor
any yuell wyll ſhewed. There was good
cauſe for theym to be frendes toguyder / for
Loyes ſonne to the erle of Bloyes had in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryage
the lady Mary doughter to the duke
of Berrey. The duke of Iuliers wolde glad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
haue entred in to his herytage / but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
his ſonne / who ſhulde be his heyre.
Therfore he made but lytell counte of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyaunce
that his ſonne the duke of Guerles
hadde made in Englande. And by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he ſpake the wordes (that ye haue herde
here before) to the duke of Guerles / whan he
was retourned out of Englande. Howe be it
the duke of Guerles who was yonge and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragyous / 
toke lytell regarde to his fathers
wordes / and ſayde. Sir / that I haue done
I wyll vpholde: for I had rather haue warr<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

lyued fyftene dayes after in great payne and
myſery / inſo moche that phyſyke nor ſurgery

the ende of the kynge of Nauerre. And ſo the

            <p>yE haue well herde here before of the

counties of Armynake and dolphen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty / 
in Auuergne and Lymozyn / who were ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myes
to all their neyghbours. Many of them
were well content to departe / for they thought
they had warred and trauelled the realme of
Fraunce longe ynoughe / thynkynge than to
goo and robbe and pyll in other places. The
duke of Armynake promyſed theym to leade
them in to Lumbardy / But the erle of Foyze
who wolde nat lyghtly be dyſceyued thought
the contrary. He helde hym ſelfe ſtyll to ſe the

enquyred / howe the treatyes wente forwarde

ſhulde departe / and whyder they ſhuld drawe.
And the men of his countrey ſayde / that the

a bowfe a robbynge and pyllynge. Thanne
the Erle caſte downe his heed and ſayde. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

            <p>yE haue herde here before reherſed /

in no wyſe departe out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſtell / for he helde
it as his owne propre enherytaunce / and had
patyſed all the countrey there aboute / and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their pateſyng the people labored in peaſe
and reſte. Thus this Geffrey kepte the eſtate
of a greate lorde. He was a cruell man in his
dyſpleaſure / he hadde no more pytye to ſlee a
man than a beeſt. Nowe to come to purpoſe.
whan the tydinges ſpred abrode in Auuergne
and Lymozyn / of the tayle that was gathered
in the countreys / to the entente to a voyde out
of the countrey theſe men of warre. Than it
was brewted that the men of warre in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe
of Vandachor ſhulde departe / &amp; to gyue
vp the fortreſſe to the duke of Berrey. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that tydynges the people were contente
to pay this tayle. But whan they ſawe the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary
(for the moſt hurte that they had / was by
them of the garyſon of Vandachor) thought
the money that they had payed at the firſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therynge
but loſte / and ſayd howe they wolde
paye no more croſſe nor mayle / without they
of Vandachor were conſtreyned to departe
out of the countrey. Theſe tydynges came to
the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yng of the duke of Berrey / who had all
the ſoueraygne charge of the countrey of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerge / 
Lymozyn / and Gelnadan. Than the
duke and his counſayle ſayde. Surely theſe
poore men haue good cauſe to ſaye ſo / and to
be lothe to pay their money for nothinge / and
more ouer ſayde / howe he hym ſelfe and his
counſayle were to blame / that they layde nat a
ſiege aboute that fortreſſe / to kepe them of that
garyſon fro iſſuyng out. Thanne the duke of
Berrey ordeyned at the coſt and charge of the
countrey foure hundred ſpeares of good men
of armes / to beſiege Vandachor by baſtydes.
And ſoueraigne capytaynes of that company
was ſyr Willyam of Lygnac and ſyr Iohan

Theſe men of armes and knyghtes /

by men of the countrey they made great tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and defence vpon the ſtraytes, to ſtoppe
their iſſuinge out. But the capytayne Geffrey
ſet lytell therby / for he knewe well his gariſon
was well furnyſſhed with all maner of thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / 
thoughe there came no newe vytayle to
them in ſeuen yere. Alſo the caſtell ſtode in ſo
ſtrong a place vpon a rocke / that it coude take
no domage for any aſſawte. And for all this
ſiege and baſtydes / they within <abbr>wold</abbr> often ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes
iſſue out by a preuy poſterne / whiche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
bytwene two rockes / ſo that they wolde

countrey / and toke priſoners. Other thynge
they wolde bringe none to their fortreſſe / they
coulde nat bycauſe of the ſtrayte wayes / and
ſtronge mountaynes that they muſt paſſe by.
And this iſſue coulde nat be ſtopped fro them
for the aley vnder couert endured fro their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſon
a ſeuen or eight leages / or they came out
in to the feldes / and whanne they retourned a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gayne / 
by that tyme they were entered a thre
leages / they were as ſure there as within their

The ſiege laye more than a yere before the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell.

            <p>THe duke of Burgoyne forgate nat the
promiſe that he had made to his aunte

hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred men of armes / burgonyons and other / 
and made two knyghtes capytayns / the one
ſir Guylliam of Tremoyle burgonyon / the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſir Geruays of Merande almayne. And
the duke ſayd to them. ſirs / ye ſhall go to your

there as the duches of Brabante wyll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt

They made them redy and gadred

myght / and drewe in to Brabante / and ſente
worde of their comynge to the duches of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bante / 
and ſo paſſed through the lande of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenburge.
And than by the ordynaunce of the

and wolde haue againe / bycauſe they had ben

and made good fronter warre / &amp; ſomtyme
<pb n="cxxxii" facs="tcp:22067:145"/>
rode abrode to encountre their enemyes. The
duke of Guerles fortefyed hym ſelfe agaynſte
them / and furnyſſhed his townes and caſtels
agaynſt them / for he ſawe well the warre was
as than open. So it fortuned that ſyr Willy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
of Tremoyle / deſyringe to auaunce hym
ſelfe to do ſome thynge that myght ſownde to
his honoure. He ſet his imagyncion on a day
on a towne in Guerles / a foure leages fro his

he ſhewed ſecretely his entenſyon to ſyr Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uays
of Merande his companyon / who light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accorded to his mynde. So they gathered
their company togyder and departed aboute
mydnyght / and rode a rounde paſe too this
towne / and had guydes that brought them to
Seaule / by that tyme it was daylight. Than
they reſted them &amp; apoynted what they wolde

with .xxx. ſpeares / went on before for to wyn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e

by the duke of Guerles to refreſſhe the gary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Thus this knyght ſir Geruays with .xxx.
ſpeares rode before to the towne of Seaulle.
In the mornynge they founde men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
goynge to the towne / for it was markette

and founde it open with a ſmall warde / it was
ſo erly that the moſte parte of the people were

bretons are yuell people / they wyll burne and

Than the englyſſhe knyght cloſed the caſtell /

abaſſhed that they fled hyther &amp; thyder. The

ſette fyre in the towne in dyuerſe places /

douted the fyre / whan he ſawe the flames and

<pb facs="tcp:22067:146"/>
Thus the duke of Guerles had the firſt buffet

This fortreſſe ſtode in Lymozyn. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panyons
rode forthe at aduenture in to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergne / 
and a Gaſcoyne ſquyer was their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pytayne / 
called Geronet Durante / an experte
man of armes. And bycauſe the countrey was
alwayes in doute of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men of warre that were
on the fronters of Burbonoys / there was a
knyght of the duke of Burgoynes / called ſyr
Iohan Boeſme Launce / a gracyouſe and an

were of. And it was ſhewed hym howe they
were aboute a .xl. ſpeares. What quod he / it is
lytell to regarde for .xl. ſpeares / I wyll ſet as
many againſt them. and ſo departe fro thence
as he was as than / and went there as his chefe
charge was / and that was before Vandachor
He gate togyder. a .xl. or a fifty ſpeares of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozyn
and Auuergne / and Burbonoyſe / and
with hym there was a knyght called ſir Loys
Dambter / and alſo ſir Loys Dabton / and the
lorde of ſaynte Obyſe. And ſo toke the feldes
without kepyng of any high way / they knewe
the countrey / &amp; came to a paſſage where their
enemyes muſte nedes paſſe / by reaſone of the
mountaynes and ryuers whiche were greate
and depe / by occaſion of the ſnowe fallyng fro

and was nat ware of that rencountre. Than
Boeſme launce and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany / cauched their
ſpeares and came agaynſt their enemyes and
cryed their cryes. whan the engliſſhment ſawe

There was a ſore rencountre / and certayne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
throwen on bothe partyes. But to ſay the
trouth the frenchmen were better expert men
of armes than the auenturers / and that ſemed
well / for there were none of the aduenturers
that returned agayne without it were the var<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lettes /

            <p>WHan the capytayne of Galuſet was

well ſirs quod he / as for me I nother care

This was the fynall anſwere that they
coulde gette for Geronet. Than they ſayde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
themſelfe / it were beſt that two or thre
of vs retourne agayne to Geronet / and ſhewe
him all the caſe. So thre of them retourned to

Mountferante / and as they rode they paſſed
by Cleremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t / and ſawe well the walles were

another. this towne is prignable / if we come

great watche kepte. We muſte one tyme bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
and another tyme bye / we can nat both
bargayne and bye all in one daye. Thus they
rode forthe and rode to Mountferante / and
there founde Geronet and his companyons / 
and there ſhewed him all the anſwere that they
had of Perot of Bernoys / wherof they were a
baſſhed / for they wyſte nat howe nor where to
gette their raunſome. Thus all a daye and a
nyght they were in great dyſpleaſure. the next
daye Geronet ſayde to them that had brought
thoſe newes. Syrs / I requyre you retourne
agayne to our capytayne / and ſhewe hym fro
me y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue to my power whyle I was with
hym / ſerued him truely / and wyll do yet if it be
his pleaſure. And ſhewe hym if I tourne and
become Frenche to delyuer my ſelfe / he ſhall
wyn but lytell therby. And if I do it god kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
it ſhall be full ſore agaynſt my wyll / and
I ſhall forbeare it as longe as I canne. And
ſhewe hym that if he wyll nowe delyuer vs fro
hence / that within a moneth after I ſhal bring
hym to ſuche a botye / that he and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſhall wynne a hundred thouſande frankes.
With that meſſage the thre companyons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned
agayne to Galuſet / and ſhewed Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot
their meſſage. Thanne he ſtudyed a lytell
and ſayd. It maye well be as he ſayeth / at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
I ſhall delyuer him incontyuent. and
ſo opened a cofer wherin was more than thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
thouſande frankes / nat gathered of his
rentes that he hadde in Byerne / but the moſte
parte of pyllage. For the towne he dwelte in be
fore the warres was but of twelue houſes / and
the erle of Foiz was chefe lorde therof / and the
towne was called Dadam / within thre leages
of Ortays. Than he tolde oute .xxii. hundred
frankes / at a pynch a frende is knowen / I ſhall
put them in aduenture / he is well able to wyn
them agayne and mo / and he wyll. Thus they
departed fro Galuſet &amp; retourned to Mount
ferante / it was a .xiiii. great leages bytwene / 
but they had a good ſaueco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct / wherby they
paſſed in and out without daunger.</p>
            <p>Whan Geronet knewe howe he and his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany
<abbr>ſhuld</abbr> be delyuered / he was right ioyfull
and ſente for them that ſhulde receyue the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and ſayde. Syrs / holde tell your money / 
here is all that we owe you. So they tolde out
xxii. hundred frankes. Than they rekened for
their expenſes in their lodgynges / and payed
euery thynge with the largeſte / ſo that euery
man was contente. And whan all was payed / 
than Gerenot hyred men and horſes to bringe
theym to Galuſet. Whan ſyr Iohan Boeſme
launce was certifyed of the receyte of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney / 
I thynke he dyd ſende for it / or els lefte it

he wente out of his howſe and wente vpon the

without thou do this meſſage well and wyſely

I ſhall do that ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde / to the vttermeſt

ſayd / ſirs helpe your ſelfe / auaunce forth
for I can in no wyſe open this ſeconde gate / 
breke it vp with your axes / otherwyſe ye can

the caſtell whanne he vnderſtode that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyſſhe

leſynge of more / he wolde nat lette downe his

he lette them come in by meanes of a planke / 
And whanne he herde the great brewte in the
towne / than he drewe in a gayne the planke / 
and after that he wolde no more put it forthe / 
but wente aboute to ſe what defence he ſhulde
make if the caſtell were aſſayled. thus I haue
ſhewed you howe the fyrſte gate was opened / 
and the <abbr>ſecond</abbr> broken with axes and wedges / 
and than they entred fayre and eaſely. Theſe
capytayns and their companyons or they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in to any houſe / they rode all the ſtreates
in the towne togyther / to ſe if there were any
aſſemble to make any defence. And whan they
had ſertched euery place / and founde no man
to make any reſiſtence / but a certayne ſuche as
were gone to haue entred into the caſtell made
a lytell defence / but ſoone they were taken and
ſlayne. What ſhulde I make longe proceſſe / 
Thus the towne of Mounte Ferante in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergne
was taken on a thurſday at nyght / the
thyrtenth day of February / by Perot le Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noys
and his company? And whan they ſawe
howe they were lordes of the towne they toke
vp their lodgynges at their eaſe / without ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
of any houſe a fyre / or doynge of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vyolence. For Perot le Bernois had char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged
on payne of dethe no man to vyolate any
maner of woman or mayden / nor to ſette any
houſe a fyre / nor to take no good nor priſoner
lytell nor greate / tyll he had fyrſte knowledge
therof. And alſo / that no man ſhulde be ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to hurte any churche or trouble any man of
the churche / nor to take any thynge out therof.
This maner euer Perot vſed whan ſo euer he
wanne any towne or fortreſſe. But Geffary
Tele noyre dyd always the contrarye / for he
neuer cared for churche nor for nothynge els / 
ſo that he myght haue it and get good / he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
nat howe.</p>
            <p>THe ſame mornynge whanne tydinges
of this dede came to the knowledge of
them of Cleremounte / whiche was but a ſmall
leage thens / they were ſore abaſſhed and good
cauſe why / for their enemyes were nere them.
They wyſte nat what to ſaye or do / but toke
good bede to defende their towne. Theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
ſpredde a brode to the caſtell Neuffe / to
Thyon / to Vyc / to Iſſoire / to Ryon / and fro
thence to Auige Perſe / &amp; to caſtell of Mounte
Pencyer. And all theſe townes and countreys
that I haue named / the moſte parte pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the duke of Berrey. In farre countreys
theſe tydynges ſpred a brode / howe theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyſſhe
men and gaſcoyns had wonne and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the good towne of Mount ferante in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergne.
As many as herde therof meruayled
greatly / and were in doute / and the countreys
adioyning were halfe a frayde / as Auuergne / 
Burbonoys / Foreſtes / and to Berrey. Whan
theſe newes came to Parys the kyng and his
vncles were ſore diſpleaſed / whiche was good
reaſon / for the ſame tyme the erle Dolphyn
was at Parys for the orderynge of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey / 
for he hadde the ſoueraygne charge of
<pb n="cxxxvi" facs="tcp:22067:149"/>
kepynge therof / with the erle of Armynake.
Therfore this dede was greatly to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure / 
for they thought they ſhulde beare
ſome blame for that dede / bycauſe it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their rule: But their excuſe was reaſona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble / 
for it was well knowen howe they were
in treatie with all the companions / wherfore
they thought the countre at that tyme hadde
ben in good ſuretie. Than incontynent the
erle Dolphyn departed fro Parys to go in
to Auuergne / to ſette an order in the countre
and lefte all his trayne behynde hym: And ſo
rode but alonely with his page / and toke his
waye by Moulyns in Burbonoyes to go to
Auuergne / and chaunged euery daye freſſhe
horſes. And as he rode in this haſte at ſaynt
Pier the mynſter he herde other tidynges / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

And in her company her two fayre ſon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes

The erle of Stampes who right well coude
acquyte hymſelfe amonge great princes and
ladyes (for he had been brought vp amonge
theym in his youthe) acquytedde hym ſelfe
right ſagely with the duke. And ſhewed nat
the princypall affectyon of his corage at his

dayes / and whan he ſawe his tyme he humy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
hym ſelfe greatlye to the duke / the rather
therby to drawe hym to his entent / and than
ſayd. Sir and my right dere coſyn / ye ought
nat to marueyle thoughe I am come ſo farre

And than notably he ſhewed hym the charge
that he hadde to ſaye to hym / on the behalfe
of the duke of Berrey / of the whiche wordes
<pb facs="tcp:22067:152"/>
the duke made light. And for reſolucion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere

I ſhall remembre me and ye ſhall abyde here

the erle coulde nat haue / as at that tyme.
The erle taryed there a fyftene dayes / and the
duke ſhewed hym gret loue / and ſhewed hym
the fayre caſtell of Ermyn / whiche was nere
to Wannes the whiche the duke had newely
made / and there he toke parte of his paſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
And alwayes whanne he ſawe a conuenyente
tyme / he ſhewed ſwetely and ſagely the cauſe
of his comyng. And euer the duke aunſwered
hym ſo couertly / that the erle coulde haue no
ſuretie in any aunſwere / to make any reſtytu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of a hundred <abbr>thouſand</abbr> frankes nor of the
caſtels that he helde of the conſtables / the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
yet at the ende he dyd / and that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
requeſt of any perſone / whan it was leſte
loked for (as I ſhall ſhewe you hereafter as I
was enfourmed) Whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erle Stampes ſawe
that he laye there in vayne / than he thought to
take his leaue / and to retourne in to Fraunce / 
and ſo he dyd. The duke gaue hym leaue / and
at his departynge gaue hym a fayre whyte
palfrey / aparelled and it had ben for a kynge / 
and gaue hym a fayre rynge with a ſtone / well
worthe a thouſande frankes. Thus the erle de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parted
and retourned by Angers / and there
founde the quene of Napoles / and Iohan of
Bretayne / who greatly deſyred to here tydyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and ſayd. Fayre coſyn / I thynke ye haue
ſped well / for ye haue taryed longe out. Than
the erle ſhewed parte of his buſyneſſe but fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
howe he had ſpedde nothynge. Whan he
had taryed there a day / he departed and went
to Towrs / and at laſt came in to Berrey / and
founde the duke at Mehyn / a caſtell of his / 
whiche he had newly made / and had worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
dayly theron. Whan the duke of Berrey
ſawe the erle of Stampes he made hym good
chere / and demaunded tydinges of Bretayne.
There he declared fro poynt to poynte all that
he had ſente and herde / and ſayde: howe in no
wyſe he coulde breke the duke of Bretayne fro
his purpoſe. The duke of Berrey paſſed the
mater lyghtly / whan he ſawe it wolde be none
otherwyſe. And ſo retourned in to Fraunce to
the king and to the duke of Burgoyne his bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther / 
and ſhewed theym howe he had ſente in

tymes (and bare out a good face) If we haue
loſt this yere / by the grace of god a nother ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſhall be for vs. the fortunes of this worlde
are meruaylous / they can nat be always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manente.
Alſo the kynge of Portugale gaue
hym alwayes good comforte / and ſayde. Syr
ye may abyde here and kepe your aſtate / and

that they maye ſende you this nexte
Marche a fyue or ſyre hundred ſpeares / and

myndes to make warre into Caſtyle / &amp; ſo we
ſhall make a good warre. ſomtyme one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
wynneth and a nother leſeth. The duke of
Lancaſtre thanked the kynge of Portugale of
his good comforte and offre. Howe beit for all
that the kyng was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dukes ſonne in lawe / and
had maryed his doughter / and that he ſayde
was of a good wyll. yet for all that the duke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouered
nat all his corage / for he knewe well
Englande was in trouble / and great debate a
monge the lordes / and howe the lordes hadde
maters yno we to attende vnto / as well for the
kepynge of the fronters agaynſt Scotlande / 
as for to treate with the duke of Bretaygne.
And the kyng knewe well that whan the duke
came out of Englande / there was a do to ſette
forwarde his armye / wherfore he thought it
ſhulde be harde to get any newe ayde thence / 
ſeinge the realme at ſo many great charges all
redy / and alſo he thought well that ſuche en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyſſhmen
as were retourned wolde no more
come thyder agayne / but thought rather that
they ſhulde dyſcorage other to come. the duke
conſidered all theſe maters in his mynde / and
whan he had ben a ſeaſon at the cytie of Porte
with the kynge of Portugale / than on a daye
he ſayd. Syr / it ſhulde be for my profyte to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne
to Bayon / and to the marches of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaulx
for dyuerſe reaſons. He ſawe well his
beynge in Portugale coulde do him lytell ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage / 
for there he was nat on his herytage
that he deſyred / but he ſayde his goynge in to
the archebyſſhoppriche of Burdeaux and of
Auloſe / and ſo to retourne by Bygore / and ſo
by the lande of the lombriſience / of the countie
of Foyze / and countie of Armynake / and ſo by

Criſtynge / Poictou / Auuergne and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſyn / 
wherin were many garyſons and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels
holden of the engliſſhe parte / who wolde
all make warre for his ſake. Wherfore he ſayd
it were better for hym to be amonge theym to
counſaile and encorage them / than to be in any
other place. And alſo he ſayde howe Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale
was farre of to here any newes out of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande / 
and alſo he knewe well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the englyſſh
men wolde be lothe to come thyder bycauſe of
the long voyage by ſee / and alſo he knewe well
that ſhyppes of Spaygne / of Galyce / and of
Caſtyle were goynge and comynge on the ſee
in and out to Flaunders with their marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſes / 
whiche was alſo great daunger for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countrynge
of them. All theſe thynges conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred / 
the duke of Lancaſtre prepared for his
departynge / and had ſhyppes apoynted hym
by the kynge / and a patrone called Alphons
Bretat. Whan theſe galyes were redy and the
wynde good / the duke and the duches and her

and entred on the ſee / abydynge goddes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

at pleaſure / ſo that they aryued at Bayon
of whoſe comynge they of the countrey were
ioyfull / deſyringe ſore to ſe them.</p>
            <p>Whan the duke and the duches and their
doughter were aryued at Bayon. Tydynges
<pb facs="tcp:22067:153"/>
therof ſpredde abrode / and they of Burdeloys
were ryght ioyfull therof. Than ſir Iohan of
Harpdame ſeneſſhall of Burdeaux / and the
ſeneſſhall of the landes came thyder to ſe the
duke / and ſo dyd other gentlemen of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey / 
as the lorde of Mucydente / the lorde of
Duras / the lorde of Roſem / the lorde of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duras / 
the lorde Leſpare / the lorde of Newe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſteaur / 
and other knyghtes and ſquyers of
the countrey. Thus they came dayly / ſome at
one tyme ſome at another / all they offred hym
their ſeruyce / as they ought to do to their <abbr>lord.</abbr>
Thus the duke taryed at Bayon / and often ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes
ſente in to Englande to the kynge his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe / 
and to his other bretherne. But for all
his writynge he was nothynge comforted / no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with men of armes nor archers / for as the
worlde wente than / the dukes buſyneſſe was
lytell taken hede vnto / nor lorde / knyght / nor
ſquyer to make any haſt to auaunce forwarde
to the ayde of the duke of Lancaſtre. for ſuche
as had ben in Portugale made ſuche reporte
through the realme of Englande / that no man
had corage to auaunce thyder / but euery man
ſaid. the voyage in to Caſtyle is to farre of fro
vs. It is more profytable for vs to haue warre
with Fraunce / for that is a good ſwete coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
and temperate / and good lodgynges and
fayre ſwete ryuers. And in Caſtyle there is no
thynge but harde rockes and Mountaynes / 
whiche are nat good to eate / and an vntempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ayre / and troubled ryuers / and dyuerſe
meates / and ſtronge wynes &amp; hote / and poore
people / rude / and yuell arayed / farre of fro our
maner. wherfore it were folly to go thyder / for
if we entre in to any great cytie or towne there
wenynge to fynde maruayles / we ſhall fynde
nothynge but wyne / larde / and empty cofers.
This is contrarye to the realme of Fraunce / 
for there whan it is fortune to wyn any towne
or cytie / we fynde ſuche rycheſſe that we be a
baſſhed therof / and it is good to make warre
where we may haue profyte. let vs aduenture
there / and leaue the vnhappy warre of Caſtyle
and Portugale / where is no thynge but pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertye
and domage. Thus the englyſſhe men
ſayde in Englande / ſuche as had been in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyle / 
ſo that the lordes perceyued well howe
that voyage was out of the fauoure of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyſſhe
men. Alſo the realme was in trouble / 
and the iuſtyce of Triuylyen and outher but
newly done / and the duke of Irelande depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of the Realme / and kynge Rycharde
came to the guydynge of newe counſayle / the
whiche he hadde nat well lerned. So by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſuche inſydentes the matters abode in
harde caſe for the duke of Lancaſtre / beynge
in the cytie of Bayon / where he helde all that
ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>ALl theſe buſyneſſes as well in Caſtyle
and Portugale / as in Englande (and
of the departyng of the duke of Irelande) was
well knowen with the frenche kynge and his
counſayle. Than to haue more parfyte know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge / 
it was ordayned by the frenche kynge
and by his vncles to ſende to Trecte to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke
of Irelande / where as he was / and to gyue
hym a ſure ſaueconduct to come into Fraunce
and to tarye there as longe as bothe partyes
were pleaſed. It was behouable to ſende for
hym by ſpecyall meſſangers / and ſure wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
fro the kyng / or els the duke of Irelande
wolde nat haue come there / for he knewe well
that he was out of the loue and fauoure of the
lorde Coucy / who was a great baron in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme
of Fraunce / and was of a great lynage.
He had no cauſe to loue hym (as ye haue herde
before) for acordynge to the trouthe the duke
had nat well acquyted hymſelfe to his wyfe / 
who was doughter to the lorde Coucy. And
certaynly it was the principall thing that toke
awaye the good renome of his honour / bothe
in Fraunce and in other places. And in lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe
he was blamed / defamed / and hated in
Englande / as well as in Fraunce. Whan the
frenche kynge had concluded to ſende for the
duke of Irelande / the lorde of Coucy ſpake as
moche agaynſt it as he myght / but there were
ſo many reaſons layde to hym (and alſo by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the kyng wolde haue it) that he was con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tente
to ſuffre it. The frenche kynge who was
but yong deſyred greatly to ſe the duke of Ire<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lande / 
bycauſe he was reputed to be a good
knyght / and alſo bycauſe it was ſayd howe he
was ſo well beloued with the kynge of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande.
Thanne he was ſente for by a knyght
and a clerke / a notary of the kynges. Whan
the Duke of Irelande herde fyrſte howe the
frenche kynge had ſente for hym / he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
therof / and hadde dyuerſe imagynacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for what entente he ſhulde be ſente for in
to Fraunce / howe be it fynally he thought the
<pb n="cxl" facs="tcp:22067:153"/>
myght go ſurely in to Fraunce to ſe the kynge
by reaſon of his ſaueconducte / and to returne
agayne at his pleaſure. Than he departed fro
Trecte / and rode forthe with theym that the
kynge had ſent to hym / and rode ſo longe that
they came to Paris / for as than the kyng was
there in his caſtell of Lowre. There the duke
was well receyued of the kynge and of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
The frenche kynge deſyred him to abyde
there ſtyll and apoynted hym a place to kepe
his houſe &amp; aſtate in / for the duke had ynough
ſo to do / for he had conueyed out of Englande
good ynough. And alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſtable of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
ought hym certayne money for the raunſome
of Iohan of Bretayne / the whiche was nat all
payed as than. Thus the duke wente whan it
pleaſed hym to ſe the kynge / and hadde good
chere. and at all feaſtes / iuſtes / and triumphes
the duke was alwayes ſente for.

howe the duke of Bretayne wolde in no wyſe

for hym to take the conſtable of Fraunce / and
to ſette hym at raunſome at a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande

hym / where ſo euer he fynde hym / or
els to make hym flye or yelde hym in the felde / 
and therby the kynge ſhall haue more honour
and leſſe charge than to go in to Guerles / for
ſuche as knowe the countrey ſaye / that or we

duke had a baſtarde doughter / maryed to the
ſonne of the <abbr>lord</abbr> Bruke / who was enherytour
to the towne of Graue. So there was an amy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able
treatye bytwene them / as bytwene the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and the ſonne. and there the lorde of Bruke
gaue the towne and ſygnory of Graue to the
duke of Guerles / in preſence of the knyghtes
of Guerles and Iuliers. and for that cauſe the
duke of Guerles dyd recompence the lorde of
Bruke with the landes of Breſde / on the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of Lighen in the duchy of Guerles / mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng
on the countrey of Holande aboue Bra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baunte.
At this towne of Breſde there was a
fayre caſtell / and the towne great and profyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble / 
how be it the towne of Graue was better.
This the duke of Guerles dyd to the entent to
haue a iuſte tytle to kepe the towne of Graue
agaynſt the brabanſoys. The duches of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant
and the brabanſoys ſaid / howe the lorde
of Bruke had it but to pledge / and that they
myght quyte it out whan they wolde / but the
duke of Guerles ſayd nayetherto. By reaſon
wherof the warre moued. So that in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

ſyege to the towne of Graue / with many lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / 
knyghtes / and ſquyers / and with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſſaunce
of other good townes in Brabante.
And thyder they brought engyns / ſpringals / 
and other habylimentes of warre. They were
a .xl. thouſande one and other / there was ſkry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſſhynge
dayly. The towne of Graue ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
on the ryuer of Mueſe on the ſyde of Bra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bante / 
and there is a bridge ouer the ryuer to
go in to the countrey of Guerles. At this ſiege
euery thynge was plenty / and as good chepe
of euery thynge / as though they had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Bruſels. Euery day there was ſkrymyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhynge

wolde aduenture them ſelfe. Sometyme they
were put a backe / and ſome tyme they droue
their enemyes in to their towne / as chaunce
of aduenture fell. The duke of Guerles was
well infourmed of this ſiege. He laye a foure
leages fro Nymarſe / and wrote often tymes
in to Englande / where he truſted to haue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coure
by reaſon of the englyſſhe army / wherof
the erle of Arundell was capytayne on the ſee /

to come to Guerles to reyſe the ſyege before
Graue. The duke of Guerles knewe well that
the towne of Graue was ſtrong and well forty
fyed / ſo that he thought it coulde nat be wonne
by none aſſaute / but outher by trayſon or by
treatye. He truſted theym of Gruae to be ſure
and faythfull to hym. Thus the ſiege endured
longe before Grane. And the erle of Arundels
army was on the ſee / and tooke no lande / but
ſtyll kepte on the fronters of Normandy / So
that the normans fro agaynſt Mounte ſaynte
Mychell / and downe alonge to Depe to ſaynt

wherto they <abbr>ſhuld</abbr> take hede. The portes and
hauens of Normandy were refreſſhed by the

And by the marſhall of Blankewyll was ſette

the towne of ſaynte Mathews / and as ſoone
as they knewe that the englyſſhe men were on

The apparaunce herof is great / for there

Naye ſirs nat ſo ꝙ maiſter yues / who was

agayne / ye can not ſende one more agreable

            <p>THis mater wente ſo forwarde that

ſent for his men that was in them / and rydde
his handes clene of them: and there were ſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blyſſhed

ſhulde iudge by good delyberacion.
And whan the knowledge of the reſtytucion
of theſe caſtels was come to the lorde of Cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cye /

Sirs / we haue the leſſe to do / I beleue the

we ſhall mete with hym and ſpeke toguyder
Theſe thre lordes ſaid they wolde do as they

they rode tyhder. Their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mynge was anon
knowen in the dukes court / for they had ſent
before their herbygers to take vp their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynges.
The duke had about hym his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle
<pb facs="tcp:22067:158"/>
&amp; greate lordes / ſuche as he truſted moſt
the more honourably to receyue theſe lordes.
Whan they entred in to the towne of Wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes
they had good chere / and lordes and knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of the dukes mette them / and ſpecially the
lorde de la Wall. there they a lyghted at their
lodgynges &amp; refreſſhed them ſelfe / and after
mounted on their horſes and rode to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
caſtell called la Mote / where they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
the duke who came agaynſt them / and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> right ioyouſly and ſayd: Howe they

Sir quod the lorde of Coucy I thanke you / 
I and my company ſhall be gladde to ſe it.
There was ſhewed bytwene them great ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelyhode
of loue: and the duke brought hym
to his chambre / ſportyng and talkyng of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
ydell matters / as lordes do often tymes
whan they mete / and haue nat ſene toguyder
longe before / they wyll fynde many ſondrie
paſtymes. and ſpecially I knewe four lordes
the beſt entertayners of all other that euer I
knewe / That was the duke of Brabant / the
erle of Foiz / the erle of Sauoy / and in eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
the lorde of Coucy: For accordynge to
myne aduyſe in all goodly paſtymes he was
a ſouerayne maiſter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all lordes and ladyes / in Fraunce / in
Englande / in Almaygne in Lombardy / and
in all places where as he had ben conuerſant
And in his tyme he had been ſore traueyled &amp;
ſene moche in the worlde: and alſo he was na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turally
enclyned to be gentyll. &amp; thus whyle
theſe lordes were mery talkynge toguyder / 
there was brought ſpyces and wyne and ſo
they dranke / and than toke their leaues and
retourned to their lodgynges. Thus the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
went for the y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſt day / without makyng
of any mencyon of any thyng that they were

            <p>NOwe let vs ſomwhat ſpeke of ſir He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon
of Lygnacke / whom the duke of
Berrey hadde ſent to the duke of Lancaſtre.
The knyght came to Bayon and a lyghted

knewe well of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng / and ſent right ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nourably
two of his knyghtes to mete with
hym / and they brought hym to the duke. And
whan ſir Helyon was in the dukes preſens
he kneled downe / and ſaluted hym as it aper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyned.
The duke receyued hym right hono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rably
and tooke hym vp in his armes / &amp; toke
hym by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hande and ledde hym in to his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre / 
for he mette hym in the hall. Thanne the
knyght delyuered his letters fro the duke of
Berry. The duke reed them and thanne he
drewe to ſir Helyon / and the knight declared
to him the cauſe of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng. Than the du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
anſwered right courteſly and ſayd. Sir /

was weyghtie that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e for / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Thus ſir Helyon taryed at Bayon with the
duke of Lancaſtre more than a moneth / and
alwayes he was ſerued with fayre wordes:
And the duke alwayes foded hym forthe and
made ſemblant that he had great affection to

Howe be it the trouthe was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary / for
all that he ſhewed was but diſſymulacion.
and the cauſe that he was helde there ſo long
with hym / was for none other thing / but that
the brute therof myght ronne abrode / and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially
in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme of Caſtyle / for there lay
all his affection: The duke ſayde to ſir He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon.
Sir / if I treat with the duke of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey

brabanſoys were ouer the ryuer. Thanne ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynges
came to the Seneſchall of Brabante /

ſurely that for euery man that the duke
of Guerles had / that he had been ſyre. Than
they reſted to ſette them ſelfe in ordre / but they
had no leyſar. For ther with came on them the
duke of Guerles with his route cloſe togyder / 
as faſte as ſpurres wolde dryue their horſes / 
cryenge their cryes / our lady of Guerles / with
their ſpeares in the reſtes. There was a ſquier
of Guerles greatly to be prayſed / for the great
deſyre that he had to exalte his renome. he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped
before all the batayls / and was the firſte
that iuſted / and entred in amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge his enemies.
the ſquier was called Arnolde Morber. With
that courſe he bare one to the erthe rudely / I
canne nat tell if euer he was releued or nat / for
the preaſe was ſo greate / that harde it was / if
one were downe to be releued agayn / without
it were by great helpe. At this firſt rencountre
there were of the brabanſoys a ſire ſcore borne
to the erthe. There were many beaten downe / 
and ſmall defence made by the Brabanſoys / 
for they were ſodenly taken. and ſo ſhulde men
of warre do / that thinke to do domage to their
enemyes. For the brabanſoys for all that they
were ſo greate a nombre / and ſo many great
men / yet they were ſo farre a ſonder / and out of
araye / that they coulde nat gette togyther in
ordre of batayle / but their batayle was pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
throughe and ſparkled a brode / ſome here
and ſome there / ſo that the lordes of Brabante
coulde nat come to their owne men / nor their
menne to theym. And ſuche as were behynde / 
whanne they herde the noyſe and brewte / and
ſawe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duſt and powder ryſe / it ſemed to them
properly that the voyce of the dyſcomfetture
came on theym / and howe all their company
were ouercome. So that the feare therof cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them to tourne and to flye towardes Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſten
agayne / and ſome toke the ryuer at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
bothe a foote and a horſebacke / with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſerrchyng of the depeneſſe / or without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge
of any guyde. And as they fledde they
thought euer their enemyes had been at their
backes. By this dyſcomfettynge of them ſelfe
there were drowned and in parell / moo than
twelue hundred in the ryuer of Meuſe / for they
lepte in one vpon a nother lyke beeſtes / with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ordre or reaſon And ſome of the great lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
and barones of Brabante / whome I wyll
nat name / for it ſhulde be blame to them and to
their heyres / to be noted to flye away ſo ſhame
fully / and to ſeke for their ſauegarde nother
the right paſſage of the ryuer / nor yet the hygh
way to the towne of Raueſten / but rather other
ſtraunge wayes to flye fro their enemyes. In
this myſchyefe fell that daye the chyualrye of
Brabante / bytwene the towne of Graue and
Raueſten many were ſlayne and taken / For
ſuche as came to raunſome yelded lightly / and
the almayns were gladde to take them / for the
profyte that they thought to haue by theym.
And ſuche as retourned to the lodgynges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Graue abaſſhed them that were there ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge
at the ſyege / for they came lyke men clene
diſcomfyted. They came flyenge ſo faſte that
they lacked brethe / ſo that they coulde ſkante
ſpeke any worde (that they ſayd / was) Syrs
gette vs all hence for we be all dyſcomfyted / 
there is no comeforte. Whan they in the hooſt
vnderſtode the trouthe of the mater / and ſawe
their company in that caſe / they were than ſo a
baſſhed &amp; a frayed / that they had no leyſar nor
puyſſaunce to take their owne goodes / nor to
take downe their tentes nor pauylyons / nor to
truſſe horſe / carte / nor wagon / but ſodaynely
departed without byddynge adewe / and lefte
all behynde. They were ſo a frayde that they
made no countenaunce of a bydynge. They
toke with theym nother vytayle nor caryage / 
but ſuche as hadde horſes lepte on them / and
fledde a waye towardes the dukes wodde / or
els towardes Hondan / or to the mount ſaynte
Geruays / or to Gertras / and Dordec. They
had none other care but to ſaue them ſelfe fro
their enemyes. And if they within the garyſon
of Graue had ſoner knowen of the dyſcomfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture / 
it had been greatly for their profyte / and
had ſlayne or taken many of their enemyes in
their flyenge / but they knewe it nat tyll it was
late / howbeit whan they iſſued out they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
great plentye of Tentes and pauylyons / and
prouyſion of engyns / gonnes / and artyllery / 
which they brought in to their towne at good
leyſar / for there were none to ſaye them naye.
Thus brake vp the ſiege of Graue to the gret
domage of all the brabanſoys / wherof great
brute ranne in dyuers countreys / howe that a
<pb n="clii" facs="tcp:22067:165"/>
handefull of men dyſcomfyted .xl. thouſande / 
and reyſed the ſiege. there was taken the lorde
of Bourguenall / and the lorde of Linyer / and
other to the nombre of ſeuentene baners / they
were hanged before the ymage of our lady of
Nymay / for a perpetuall memory.

there was ſette in his ſtede the lorde Henry

lordes of his lygnage / thoughe they were of

all this knewe ryght well the ſcottes. Than
the lordes and knyghtes of Scotlande de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyned

We maye go where we lyſt / and our countre

the Engliſſhe ſquyer went ſo forwarde / that
without eſpyeng he came to the churche of ze<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don /

he encred in amonge them lyke one of their

And whan he was gone fro the churche

He began to varry in his ſayeng / and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red

to the erle Duglas and to other lordes: they
examyned hym and parceyued well he was

He was yuell wyllynge to ſhewe the

drawe. Herof the ſcottes were right ioyous /

            <p>Whan I departed from them fro Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell

and if ye take nat that waye than they wyll
go by Carlyle / and in to the mountayns of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

THe lordes of Scotlande were ryght

counſayle what waye was beſt for

in warre ſpake fyrſt / and that was ſir
Archanbas Duglas and therle of Fenne / ſir
Alyſander Ramſey / ſir Iohan Saynt clere /

of faylynge of our entent / we counſayle that
we make two armyes / to the entente that our

And lette the mooſt parte of our hooſt

Than they ordeyned to aſſayle the caſtell and

the towne and caſtell was brent / and fro thens
the Scottes wente to the towne and caſtell of

this was their entenſyon.</p>
            <p>NOwe lette vs ſpeke of ſir Henry Percy

that therle Duglas had wonne the pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>non

that he ſhulde nat cary his penon out of

Knyghtes and ſquiers that herde him agreed

ſhulde fight with the ſcottes. Therfore the

comynge to Newcaſtell. But ſir Henry Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
wolde nat abyde his comynge / for he had

thought that ſufficyent nombre to fyght with

ſpeares / &amp; thre thouſande of other. Thus they
departed fro Newcaſtell after dyner / and ſet

Therwith ſodenly the englyſſhmen came on

at the entre of the lodgynges / and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane

bycauſe the engliſſhmen were a great nombre

            <p>THus on this poynte departed the duke
of Iulyers from his ſonne the duke of
Guerles / and with him the archebyſſhoppe of
Coloygne / and ſo they returned in to Iulyers
and came to Endeſker. And whan tyme was
they wente to the frenche kynge / and ſhewed
him all the poyntes and artycles before reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed / 
and ſayd. Syr / loke what ye wyll do with
the duke of guerles / for other than this ye ſhall
nat haue of hym. The frenche kynge greatly
deſyred to ſe the duke of Guerles his coſyn / by
cauſe he had put hym to ſomoche payne / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſoner he enclyned to this treatye. And
the duke of Burgoyn who wolde alſo that the
duches of Brabant and her countrey ſhulde a
byde in reſt and peace / he toke payne to bringe
this creatie to effecte / and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the duke of Guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
myght come to ſpeke with the kynge. And
alſo there was one thynge that made them the
ſoner agre / wynter aproched and the nyghtes
began to be longe and colde / and alſo the lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of Fraunce were enfourmed that Guerles
was no countrey to reſt in / in the tyme of wyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter.
and alſo dayly they had reporte howe they
loſte of their men / bothe knyghtes and ſquy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by the ſynſars almayns / who dayly lay in
wayte for them. So many reaſons and conſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deracyons
were layde and alledged that they
fell to acorde / and the duke of Guerles apro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and the duke of Iulyers his father / &amp; the
duke of Lorayne and the byſſhop of Coloigne
brought hym in to the kynges tente / where
there was with the kynge his thre vncles / and
his brother the duke of Tourayne &amp; the duke
of Bare / the erle of Marche / the erle of ſaynte
Pole / the erle dolphyn of Auuergne / the lorde
Coucy / and the conſtable of Fraunce. There
the duke of Guerles kneled downe before the
kynge / and as it was infourmed me / the kyng
toke hym vp / and there valyauntly and wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he exſcuſed hym ſelfe of the defyaunce that
he had made to the kynge. And moreouer he
ſware / that if euer he wolde defye the kynge or
make warre to the realme of Fraunce / that he
wolde gyue the kynge knowlege therof a yere
before / and the countreys of Guerles and Bra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bante
to be ſtyll in the ſame caſe / as they be in
at that ſame preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tyme. Thus the mater con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluded
bytwene them. and the duke of Guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
ſupped with the kynge the ſame nyghte at
his table / he was greatly regarded / bycauſe
he had put the kynge to ſo moche payne and
coſte. This treatie and concluſyon was put in
writynge and ſealed / and whan all was done
the lordes toke leaue to departe. but or they de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parted
the duke of Guerles demaunded of the
kynge / that all ſuche priſoners as the Frenche
men had taken in that warre / that he myght
haue them delyuered franke and free. He had
his deſyre / they were delyuered. Thanne the
kynge demaunded of the duke / that all ſuche
pryſoners as his men had taken in that voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
ſhulde be delyuered and rendred agayne.
Than the duke of Guerles excuſed hym ſelfe / 
and ſayde. Syr that I can not do / I am but a
poore man / and whan I knewe of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge
I fortifyed my ſelfe the beſt I myght
with men of warre / knyghtes and ſquyes fro
beyonde the ryuer of Ryne / and other places / 
and I promyſed them that what ſo euer they
wanne in this warre / it ſhulde be their owne.
wherfore I can take nothinge fro them of that
they haue wonne / if I wolde / I haue nouther
puyſſaunce nor power to do it / for if I wolde
ſhewe rygoure to theym / they wolde make
warre agaynſt me. wherfore ſir / may it pleaſe
you to lette it paſſe / for I canne nat remedy it.
The kynge ſawe he coulde haue nothyng els / 
he ſuffred it to paſſe / and imagyned that he
and his realme were riche ynough to encreaſe
poore men / wherfore he let it paſſe / and ſpake
no mo wordes / and at their departure eche of
theym well contented other. Than it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
to dyſlodge and to retourne the ſame
way they came / and than it was ſayd that the
frenche kynge ſhulde be at the cytie of Reynes
at the feeſt of all ſayntes / and there to holde a
<pb n="clxv" facs="tcp:22067:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great feeſt. Thus euery man dyſlodged and
retourned. ¶Nowe lette vs ſpeke of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyſſhe

ſayde. Syr I ſaye nothynge but well / if

thre realmes / what by ſee and by lande / they
maye make warre to the realme of Fraunce.
Wherfore they ſayde / it were good that the

of Caſtyle hath made alyau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in maner with

of Vandachore. But fyrſte we wyll ſpeke of
the duke of Berrey who had great deſyre to
mary / as he well ſhewed within that yere.
Whan he ſawe that he had fayled of the duke
of Lancaſters doughter. he was enfourmed
that the erle of Boulonge had a fayre dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
named Iane / doughter to the lady Elya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Comynges / howe be it ſhe was nat
with her father nor with her moder / ſhe was
in the countrey of Bierne with the Erle of
Foiz her great frende and coſyn. She hadde
ben there brought vp and nouryſſhed &amp; well
entreated the ſpace of nyne yeres / in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
of Ortayes / without coſt or charge to fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
or mother. The erle often tymes hadde
been deſyred to haue had her maryed: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the erle aunſwered that the damoſell
was to yonge. Specially ſir Bernarde bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the erle of Armynacke hadde deſyred
to haue her / and promyſed that if he myght
haue her in maryage / the warre ſhulde ende
bytwene them / for the chalenge of the lande
of Byerne. But for all thoſe promyſes / the
erle wolde nat agree therto / but aunſwered
euer / howe that his coſyn was to yonge. but
amonge his owne men he wolde ſaye other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe.
For as ſir Eſpaygne du Lyon ſhewed
me / he wolde ſaye / howe they of Armynacke
myght well repute hym for a beeſt / if he ſhul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
graunt their deſyre / ſeynge it was to his
do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage. For if he ſhulde graunt theym his
coſyn in maryage / he ſhulde ſtrength them / 
and enfeble hym ſelfe. Sayeng / howe they
of Armynake helde by force and nat of right
the countie of Comynges / the whiche hery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
is by his mother and aunte to my coſyn
of Boloyne. I wyll well they knowe I ſhall
mary her in ſo ſtronge a place and puiſſaunt
to make warre with them for the herytage of
Comynges. For as nowe there is none to an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwere
but a deed man.</p>
            <p>THus whan the erle of Armynacke &amp;
ſir Bernarde his brother / ſawe that
they coulde nat come to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe / 
as long as her aunte lyued. Than they
ſayde to the duke of Berrey / that this lady
ſhulde be a fayre maryage for Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey
his ſonne. And by their ſettynge on / the
duke ſente ſuffycient and noble meſſangers
in to Byerne to the erle of Foiz. Deſyringe
hym that all yuell wyll might be ſette aparte
and euery thynge pardoned of tymes paſte / 
and that he myght haue the damoſell of Bou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>longe / 
for Iohan his ſonne in maryage. So
that the erle of Boulonge / father to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell
dyde therto agree and aſſent. Therle
of Foiz made good chere to theſe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>baſſadors
but he excuſed hym for that maryage / &amp; ſayd
howe the lady his coſyn was to yonge: And
alſo he ſayde / howe that whan the counteſſe
of Boulonge her mother delyuered her in to
his charge / She cauſed hym to ſwere / that
he ſhulde neuer mary her in no place / with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
knowledge and conſent. And in no wyſe
he ſayde he myght / nor wolde nat breake his
promyſe nor othe / and he ſayd none ought to
deſyre hym thervnto. This excuſe the Erle
made / for he knewe well that his coſyn of Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mynges / 
who was with the erle of Vrgell
her brother in the realme of Arragon / wolde
nat agree thervnto. Thus the ambaſſadors
of the duke of Berrey retourned without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thyng doyng to their purpoſe. And whan
they were gone (as ſir Eſpaygne du Lyon
ſhewed me) the erle ſayde ah. The duke of
Berrey and his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle myght well repute
me for an ignorant / whan he wolde haue me
to enforce myne ennemyes. Iohan of Berry
is coſyn germayn to myne aduerſaries of Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mynake.
that bargayne ſhall I neuer make / 
I ſhall rather mary her in to Englande. It
hath been ſpoken of to ſir Henry of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
erle of Derby / ſonne to the duke of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtre.
If I thought nat greatly to diſpleaſe
the Frenche kynge / there ſhulde none other
haue her but he. &amp; as yet I knowe nat what
I wyll do / for I ſhall rather mary her at my
pleaſure / than they of Armynake ſhulde ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue

do or to leaue. I nede nat to trouble my ſelfe

maye recouer another / as great and as good
(as ſhe is) howe be it ſhe is very yonge for

that is the doughter of the Erle of Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe / 
the erle of Foiz hath refuſed Iohan of

and deſyred the erle to ſende hym an anſwere

that his meſſangers ſhulde nat traueyle in

receyued the meſſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers that brought the writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynge

            <p>NOwe lette vs retourne to the duke

other nobles of Fraunce came to the entre of
the countrey of Guerles: and the kyng deꝑ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thens and the duke / hauyng no great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
And whan the duke of Guerles ſawe
that all the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warre were departed / and
that he was apeaſed with the duches of Bra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bant

tent to employ his ſeaſon) to go in to Pruce / 
He made hym redy / and gate hym company
of knyghtes and ſquyers of his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey / 
and other places. And about the vtas of
ſaynt Martyn he rode forthe throughe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maygne / 
and in euery place where as he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

that he came to the lande of Pruce / I knowe

or he was ware / and ouerthewe hym and all

faythe and trouthe to paye their ran<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſomes / 
and ſpecially y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Guerles became pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner

and came with a great ſtrength of
men towardes the towne and caſtell / where
as the duke of Guerles was in priſon. Whan
the ſquyer that had taken the duke was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of the great mayſter
of Pruce with ſuche a puyſſaunce doughted
greatly / and determyned nat to abyde their
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng to the caſtell / but thought to departe
But or his departure he came to the duke of
Guerles and ſayd to hym. Sir duke / ye are
my priſoner and I am your mayſter. ye are
a ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tylman and a true knight: ye haue ſwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and gyuen me your faithe where ſoeuer I
go and wyll go / ye ought to folowe me: I
can nat tell if ye haue ſente for the great may<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter

great puyſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: I thynke nat to abyde hym
tary you here if ye lyſt / I wyll cary with me
your faythe and promyſe. The duke to thoſe
wordes gaue none anſwere: and the ſquyer
toke his horſe and departed / and wente to a
place ſtronge ynoughe: And at his deꝑtyng
he ſayde agayne to the duke. Sir / ye ſhall
fynde me in ſuche a place / he named hym a
ſtronge caſtell and oute of all hyghe wayes.
And whan he was gone the great mayſter of
Pruce came to the duke of Guerles where
as he was / for there was none to lette hym / 
and ſo delyuered the duke out of priſon: and
if he hadde founde the ſquyer there / ſurely he
had been ſlayne. Than the great mayſter of
Pruce retourned to Connyſbredge / and the
duke of Guerles with hym.</p>

I Shall ſhewe you what fell of this

ran in dyuers countreis / and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in Almaygne of the takyng of the duke

great marueile therof. Thus whan the duke
of Guerles was come to Conniſbredge and
was delyuered / as ye haue herde: than he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
hymſelfe / howe he was bounde by
his faythe to the ſquyer that tooke hym / and
remembred the wordes that the ſquier ſpake
at his deꝑtyng. than he thought in hym ſelfe
that in no wyſe he wolde breke his promyſe / 
but truely acquyte his faythe / and ſayd to the
great maiſter of Pruce / that he wolde no len<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gar
tary there / but go to the ſquyer that had
his faythe. And ſo determyned to do for any
thynge that the great mayſter coulde ſaye or
do: Nouther diſpenſacyon / abſolucyon / nor
other thyng / coude nat cauſe the duke to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyne / 
but that he wolde nedes go to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town

it for a great valyauntneſſe. Whan this
came to knowledge of his frendes and kynſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men / 
than they treated for his delyueraunce.
and ſo he was delyuered by the helpe &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the duke of Stulpe / who toke great
payne in the mater: Howe be it the duke of
Stulpe or he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented that the duke of guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
ſhulde be delyuered out of daunger / and
out of his lande / wolde in any wyſe that the

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce

And there began to treate for this maryage /

Erle of Foyze was colde / bycauſe the duke of

By reaſon of this longe taryenge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeng

that the maryage ſhulde nat be. And all their

As long as we holde to guyder / there is none

Do the lordes of Fraunce and the maner

I wyll ye knowe / that if the lorde of Clary
here preſent hadde come in to Englande / and
deſyred to haue done armes with any man / 
he ſhulde nat haue departed or he hadde ben

Thus they lefte that mater and fell in other

And I wyll that to morowe in this ſame pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce /

kynge agaynſt hym / makyng menſyon of the
errorcyons that he had done to the people. All
theſe bylles of complayntes were redde before
hym one after another. To ſome he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
wyſely / makynge his excuſe / and to ſome
he playnly denyed them and ſayde. I knowe
nothynge of thoſe maters / laye them to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſchalles
of Beaucayr and of Carcaſſone / 
and to the chauncellour of Berry / it partay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to theym to aunſwere to thoſe matters.
Howe be it fynally it was ſhewed him that he
muſte kepe pryſone for a tyme / tyll the mater
were better examyned. He obeyed bycauſe he
myght nat chuſe. As ſone as he was in priſon
the inquyſitours wente to his lodgynge / and
toke into their handes all ſuche writyngꝭ and
acomptes as they founde there / whiche par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
to ſuch maters as he had intermedled
with all before / and they auewed them at ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure / 
and founde in theym the rekenynges of
great ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes of money / ſuche as had ben ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and leuyed of the people. Than he was de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded
<pb n="clxxxii" facs="tcp:22067:196"/>
where all that money was become
and whether the ſommes were trewe or nat / 
he aunſwered and ſayde / as for the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes are
trewe / and the money delyuered to the duke
of Berrey / and ſo paſte throughe his handes
and his treaſourers / whereof I haue good
quyttaunces in my lodgynge in ſuche a place / 
the whiche quitau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces were ſente for before the
counſayle and there they were redde / and they
agreed with the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes of his receyte. Than
the counſayle and the enquyſytours were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed / 
and Betyſache ſente agayne to a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe
pryſone. Than the counſayle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned
togyther on that matter / and ſayd. It ſemeth
that Betyſache is clere of ſuche cauſes as are
layde to his charge / for the money that hathe
been reyſed / the duke of Berrey hathe had it / 
howe ſo euer it hath ben ſpente.</p>
            <p>ALl thinges conſydred / Betyſache ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſacyons
were lawfull / for the duke
of Berrey was the moſte couetouſe
man in all the worlde / ſo he myght gette good
he cared nat where nor howe he hadde it / and
whan he had it he wolde beſtowe it but ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply / 
as many lordes do and haue doone in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
paſte. Thus the kynges counſayle ſawe
no faute in Betyſache / wherby he ſhulde leſe
his lyfe. ſome were of that opynyon and ſome
contrary / &amp; ſaid. Betyſach hath done ſo many
cruell dedes / and hathe ſo ſore inpoueryſſhed
the people / for to acomplyſſhe the deſyre of his
lorde the duke of Berrey / that the blode of the
poore people cryeth out / and ſayeth / howe he
hathe deſerued dethe. For he that is a manne
borne of theſe partyes / and counſayler with
his maiſter / and ſeynge the pouerty of the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple / 
he ought in good maner to haue ſhewed
the trouth to the duke his mayſter / and if the
duke wolde nat haue herde hym / than he ſhul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
haue come to the kynge / and to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle / 
and haue ſhewed theym the pouertie of
the people / and howe the duke of Berrey had
daulte with them / than he had ben well excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
So Betyſache was ſente for agayne to
the counſayle / and ſtraytely examyned where
the money that hadde been gathered was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come / 
for they founde the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of thyrty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſande frankes receyued. He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
therto and ſayd. My lordes / it were herde
for me to tell where my lorde the duke of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey
hathe beſtowed it. Moche he hath layde
out on byldynges and reparacyons of caſtels
and houſes / alſo he hath bought certayne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
in the countye of Boloygne / and in the
Countye of Eſtampes. Alſo he hathe ſpente
moche in byenge of precyous ſtones and ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles / 
the whiche ye knowe well he hathe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
been deſyrous to bye. Alſo he is well
ſtuffed to mayntayne the aſtate that he hathe
alwayes kepte. Alſo he hath gyuen ſuche gyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and rewardes to Thybaulte and Mory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not / 
and to his ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes aboute him / in ſuche
wyſe that they be ryche men. Well Betyſache
quod they of the counſayle / and ye haue had
for your parte to your ſynguler profyte a hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred
thouſande frankes. My lordes quod he
that I haue hadde was by the conſente of my
lorde the Duke of Berrey / for he wolde that
his ſeruauntes ſhulde become ryche. Than
the counſayle ſayde all with one voyce. A Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſach
that worde is folyſſhly ſpoken / that ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe
is nat good nor reſonable that is yuell
gotten / ye ſhall retourne agayne in to priſon / 
and we ſhall take further aduyſe / on that ye
haue ſayd and ſpoken. ye muſt abyde the plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure
of the kynge / to whome we ſhall ſhewe all
your excuſacions. My lordes quod he all ſhall
be as god wyll. Than he was agayne ſette in
priſone / and there remayned four dayes or he
was ſente for agayne.</p>
            <p>WHan theſe tydynges were ſpredde a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brode
in the countrey that Betyſach
was in priſon / and that inquyre was
made of his dedes / and that it was publyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
that who ſo euer had any matter to hym
ſhulde come forthe. therby moche people came
to Beſyers / and put vp ſupplycacions to the
kynge of the cruell dedes of Betyſach. Some
complayned of hym that he hadde dyſheryted
them without cauſe or reaſon. And other com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>playned
of hym that he hadde by force taken
their wyues and doughters. Whan the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
counſayle ſawe ſo many gret cauſes laide
to Betyſache / they were wery therof. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde
all theſe complayntes he was ſore beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the people. And all this came to hym
by reaſon to fyll the duke of Berreys purſe / he
dyd euer what he wolde haue hym to do. The
kynges counſayle wyſte nat what to do / for
than there was come thyder two knightes fro
the duke of Berrey / the lorde of Nantonelet
and ſyr Peter Meſpyn / who had brought let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:22067:197"/>
to the kynge fro the duke / and they in the
dukes behalfe auowed all that euer Betyſach
had doone before / and the duke requyred the
kynge and his counſayle to haue agayne his
man and treaſourer. The kynge had greate
hatred to Betyſach / bycauſe of the yuell name
and fame that ranne vpon hym. The kynge
and the duke of Thourayne his brother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned
greatly to haue had hym hanged / ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge
howe he hadde well deſerued it. But the
kynges counſayle durſte nat iudge hym for
dought of the duke of Berrey. They ſayde to
the kynge / ſyr if the duke of Berrey auowe all
his dedes what ſo euer they be / we canne nat
ſe by no waye of reaſon that he hath deſerued
dethe / for the ſeaſone that he medled in theſe
countreys by ceſſynge of tayles / ſubſydyes / 
and aydes / and receyuynge of them / he dyd it
at the inſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the duke of Berrey who had
at that tyme there puyſſaunce royall / as well
as ye haue nowe. but ſyr / acordynge to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertes
of his dedes / ye maye ſeaſe in to your
handes all his mouables and herytages / and
leaue hym in the ſame caſe as the duke of Ber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rey
founde hym fyrſte / and with his goodes
make reſtytucion to ſuche poore men as be vn
done by hym. What ſhulde I make longe pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſe / 
Betyſache was at the poynte of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyueraunce
with the loſſe of his goodes / tyll
at the laſte other tydynges came in place. I
ſhall ſhewe you what.</p>
            <p>I Knewe nat nor I coulde nat knowe but
by knowledgyng of him ſelfe / if he were
in dede ſo yuell as he iudged himſelfe / he ſayd
he was an herytyke and had done many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryble
dedes. As it was ſhewed me there came
ſome to hym on a nyght beynge in priſone to
put hym in feare / whether they were his fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
or fooes I knowe nat / they ſayde. Bety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſach
thou art in a harde caſe / the french kyng / 
his brother / and the duke of Burbone dothe
hate you mortally / there be ſo many complayn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
put vp agaynſte you fro dyuers place / of
ſuche oppreſſyons as ye haue doone whan ye
had rule in Languedoc / ſo that they all iudge
you to be hanged / for ye canne nat ſcape with
the loſſe of your goodes / the whiche hath been
offred to the kynge. But the kynge who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
you mortally / hath aunſwered howe that
all your goodes are his / and your body alſo / 
the whiche he ſayeth he wyll nat kepe longe.
I ſhew you this for good wyll / for to morowe
it is thought ye ſhall be delyuered to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to dye. Thoſe wordes greatly afrayed
Betyſach / and ſayd to them. Ah ſaynt Mary
is there no remedy. yes quod they / to morowe
ſay how ye wolde ſpeke with the kinges coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayle / 
&amp; than outher they wyll come to you or
ſende for you to them / and whan ye be in their
preſence / than ſay thus. My lordes I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my ſelfe I haue greatly diſpleaſed god / 
and for the diſpleaſure he hath to me / this falſe
ſlaunder is reyſed on me. Than they wyll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
of you wherin. Than ye ſhall aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere / 
howe ye haue a longe ſeaſon arred in
your faythe / and that ye be an herytyke / and
kepe ſtyll that opinyon. Whan the byſſhop of
Beſyers ſhall here that / he wyll than chalenge
to haue you in his kepynge / than ye ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyuered
to hym / for ſuche cauſes ought to be
declared by the lawe of the churche / thanne ye
ſhall be ſente to Auignon / there wyll be none
againſt the duke of Berrey / the pope wyll nat
diſpleaſe hym / and by this meanes ye may be
delyuered / and nother leſe body nor goodes.
But if ye byde ſtyll in the caſe that ye be in / ye
ſhall nat ſkape paſte to morowe / but that ye
ſhall be hanged / for the kynge hateth you by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the ſlaunder of the people. Betyſache
who truſted on that falſe infourmacyon / for
he that is in parell of dethe knoweth nat well
what to do / wherfore he aunſwered and ſayd.
ye be my frende and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle me truely / wher
of god thanke you / and I truſt the tyme ſhall
come that I ſhall thanke you. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
he called the gayler and ſayde. Frende
I requyre you cauſe ſuche menne and ſuche to
come to ſpeke with me / and named ſuche as
were the enquyſitours ouer him. The gayler
ſhewed theym howe Betyſache wolde ſpeke
with them. They came to hym and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
what he wolde. He aunſwered and ſayd.
Sirs / I haue ſerched my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience / I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my ſelfe I haue hyghly diſpleaſed god / 
for longe tyme I haue arred agaynſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth / 
I neuer beleued of the Trinyte / nor that the
ſonne of god wolde come ſo lowe / as to come
fro Heuen to come in to this worlde to take
humayn kynde of a woman. for I beleue and
ſaye / that whan we dye there is nothynge of
the ſowle. Ah ſainte Mary quod they / Bety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſach
ye are greatly againſt holy churche / your
wordes demaundeth for a fyre / aduyſe you

better. I canne nat tell quod Betyſache whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my wordes demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth fyre or water / but
I haue holden this opinyon ſythe I haue had
knowledge / and ſhall holde it tyll I dye. The
enquyſitours wolde here no more of hym at
that tyme / and were gladde to fynde ſuche a
mater againſt hym / therby to put him to deth.
Than they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the gailer to kepe him
ſtraytely / and to ſuffre no man to ſpeke with
hym / to the entente that he ſhulde nat be tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
fro that opynyon. Thanne they wente to
the kynges counſayle and ſhewed them all the
mater / than they wente to the kynge and ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
hym all the maner of Betyſache (as ye
haue herde) wherof the kynge had great mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueyle
&amp; ſayd. We wyll that he be put to dethe / 
it is an yuell man / he is a falſe herytyke and a

theſe tydynges were ſpredde abrode in the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

owne voluntary wyll without any conſtraynt
confeſſed howe he was an herytyke / and had
vſed longe the ſynne of bowgery / and howe
the kynge had ſayde howe he ſhulde be brynte
and hanged / wherof moche people were right
ioyouſe / for he was ſore hated. the two knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
that were come thyder fro the duke of Ber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rey
were greatly abaſſhed and wyſt nat what
to ſuppoſe. Than ſyr Peter Meſquyn ſayde
to the lorde of Nantonelet. Syr / I feare me
Betyſache is betrayed / peraduenture ſome
perſone hath ben with hym ſecretly in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone / 
and hathe borne hym in hande that if he
holde that horryble erroure / that the churche
than ſhall chalenge hym / and ſo be ſente to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uignon
to the pope / and therby be delyuered.
Ah fole that he is / he is dyſceyued / for the kyng
ſayeth he wyll haue hym bothe brente and han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged.
Lette vs go to the priſone to hym and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
hym / and bringe hym to a nother ſtate / 
for he is farre out of the waye and yuell coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled.
They wente ſtrayte to the priſone / and
deſyred the gayler that they might ſpeke with
Betyſache. The gayler excuſed hymſelfe and
ſayde. Syrs ye muſte pardone me / for I am
ſtraytely charged to ſuffer no manne to ſpeke
with hym / and alſo here be four ſargeauntes
of armes ſente by the kynge to kepe hym / and
we dare nat breke the kinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement.
Than the two knyghtes ſawe well howe they
labored in vayne / and howe there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
by all lykelyhode / but that Betyſache
ſhulde dye. than they retourned to their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge

            <p>THe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of Betyſach was ſuche

And Betyſache who thought to haue ſaid

he aunſwered and ſayde that all was
trewe. He was demaunded this thre tymes /

is deed / but as yet we knowe nothynge
of the ſtate of the cardynals at Rome / nor of
the Romayns / nor whether they wyll kepe
their olde opinyon or nat. I feare it wyll be
harde for them to leaue it / for the Romayns
are mayſters ouer the cardynalles. Byforce
they made them to chuſe the archebyſſhoppe
of Bare / and made hym pope / and ſo mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
hym to thende. And ſo if nowe by ꝑ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
they cauſe the cardynalles to entre in to
conclaue / and to chuſe a Pope at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Wherfore ſir: ye ſhall nat nede to entre
ſo farre into the mater / as to deſyre them that
wyll do but lytell for you / as they haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
yet hydervnto. Suffre ſir tyll ye here
other newes. And paraduenture it maye ſo
be / that the cardynalles at Rome ſhall nat be
all of one accorde / and paradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture wyll diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſymule
with the Romayns / and chuſe none
other pope but Clement. And to apeaſe their
furour to promyſe them / to cauſe Clement to
come to Rome / whiche he wyll do right glad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
on that condycion. And if the mater go ſo
than ſhall it be tyme for you to write to all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
princes chriſtned / that are of the opinyon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye

            <p>WHan the duke of Burgoyne hadde
ſayde theſe wordes to the kyng and

Great murmuracyon there was a

And entended to nothynge / but to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and to knowe howe the Cardynalles of
Rome maynteyned them ſelfe. Wheder they
wolde electe a newe pope / or els to retourne
to the pope at Auignon. They dyde caſt ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny

They knewe well howe Clement had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

in the churche. Thus the clerkes deuyſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
themſelfe / and ſuche as wolde the ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uauncement

tyme that the kyng and the lordes of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

made a newe pope / the cardynall or Naples
a noble and a valyant clerke. He was called
Bonyface. Whan the Frenche kyng and his

of Burgoyne ſayde to the kyng. Sir / nowe
regarde wheder your writynges hadde nat
ben loſte or no. It is nowe fallen as I ſayd.
Fayre vncle quod the kyng / ye ſaye trouthe.
Than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e graces were opyned to all clerkes at
Rome by Bonyface / and all promyſes certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed

approched the marcheſſe of Danconne / they
rode in great paryll / For ſir Bernarde de la

warre to the Romains in the quarell of pope
Clement / toke ſuche clerkes as paſte by and

The frenche knyghtes wente to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle
togyder and dyd caſt more doutes than

the duke of Berrey had ſente them by ſix Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

There the thyrty men were taken and put a

Theſe wordes ſomewhat comforted theym.
They were put in to a chambre vnder ſure ke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pynge /

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus as I haue ſhewed / the ſtronge

ſtrake of their hedes / and hanged them vpon

Than the frenche knightes departed to go to
Ryon to the duke of Berrey / &amp; toke with them
Alayne and Peter Roux. Tydinges ſprange
abrode howe the ſtronge caſtell of Vancha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
was taken / wherof the countrey of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergne
and Lymoſyn &amp; thoſe marcheſſe were
greatly reioyſed / for the caſtell had been out of
the frenche mennes handes more than fyftene
yere / and durynge that ſeaſon that garyſone
had done great domage to the countrey. Sir
Willyam Butler founde in the caſtell a yonge
ſquier of Bretayne / a fayre yong man named
Monadich / and was coſyn to Geffray Tete<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noyre / 
and he was but newely come thyder to

brought vp in an abbaye in Bretayne / &amp; was
come out of the houſe bycauſe he wolde be no

had pytie on hym and ſaued his lyfe / with
that he wolde become frenche and ſerue hym.
Thus the frenchmen rode to the duke of Ber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rey / 
<pb n="clxxxix" facs="tcp:22067:203"/>
and brake vp their baſtydes. The men of
armes departed and went euery man to their

he rekened it to be a gret acte / the conquering

he wolde take aduyſe in that matter /

And ſo they were delyuered to the ſeneſchall
of Auuergne / and he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed them to Parys / 
and there they were put in priſon in the caſtell

there but that they were delyuered to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſt

there iudged to dye as traytours and robbers
of the realme of Fraunce. Than they were de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyuered

layde in a carre and brought with trompettes

howe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> genouoys deſyred outher to haue him

agreed that the duke of Burbone vncle to the
kynge ſhulde be ſouerayne and chefe of that

to ſome nat delectable / and many that wolde
haue gone wente nat. There was none that
went but on their owne charge and coſte. No
lorde ſente any but of their owne ſeruauntes.
Alſo it was ordeyned that none <abbr>ſhuld</abbr> paſſe of
the nacyon of Fraunce / without lycence of the
kynge / for the kynge wolde nat that ſo many
ſhulde haue gone to leaue the realme deſtitute
of knyghtes and ſquyers. Alſo it was agreed

all other nacyons / knyghtes &amp; ſquiers ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
had fre lyberty to come and to entre into
this honorable voyage / wherof all knyghtes
ſtraungers greatly prayſed the frenche kynge

Burbone who was one of the chefe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme / 
ſent incontynent his officers to Gennes
to make prouyſyon acordynge to his aſtate.
The gentle erle of Auuergne ſent alſo to Gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
to make his prouyſions / and the lorde of
Coucy was nat behynde. Alſo ſyr Guy de la
Tremoyle / and ſir Iohan of Vyen admyrall

Alſo out of Bretayne and Normandy many

apoynted / and where as all their galees and

they coude all aſſemble there. The genouoys
were right ioyfull of their comyng / and gaue
great preſentes to the chiefe lordes / the better
therby to wynne their loues. They were nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bred
whan they were togyther by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marſhals
xiiii. hundred knyghtes and ſquyers. Than
they entred in to the galees and veſſelles that
were prouyded for them / well furniſſhed of all
thynges neceſſary. Thus they departed fro
the porte of Gennes aboute the feeſt of mydſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer / 
in the yere of our lorde god a thouſande
thre hundred fourſcore and ten.</p>
            <p>GReat pleaſure it was to <abbr>behold</abbr> their

getorns / and penons wanynge
in the wynde and ſhynynge againſt the ſonne / 
and to here y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trompettes &amp; claryons ſownyng
in the ayre / with other mynſtrelſy. The fyrſte
night they lay at ancre at the entryng in to the
high ſee. all varlettes &amp; horſes abode behynde / 
a horſe that was worthe fyfty frankes at their
departyng was ſolde for ten frankes / for there
were many knyghtes and ſquiers that wyſte
nat whan they ſhulde returne. they coulde nat
haue fyue horſes kept at Gennes for a franke
a daye / and therfore at their departynge they
made money of them / and that was but lytell.
There were a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred galees garniſſhed with
men of warre / croſbowes / &amp; paueſſes / and mo
than a .C. of other veſſels laden with ꝓuyſion
&amp; other neceſſaryes. The next day at the breke
of the daye they weyed ancres / and rowed all
that day by force of owers and the nyght folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge / 
coſtyng the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. The thyrde day they

there all that night / and the next day they
came to another porte &amp; towne called the porte
Ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der / and there taryed and refreſſhed them.
The next day they paſſed further into the gret

and than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iſle of Guerfe / the iſle of Argenen / 
and the iſle of Sardyns / &amp; paſſed the Gulfe of

endured a day &amp; a night. whan this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſt
was ſeſt / and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyndes pacifyed / than the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
&amp; pylottes ſet their courſes to drawe to
the iſle of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meres / a .xxx. myle fro Auffryke.
and fro the towne thyder as they entented to
go. For at the goynge out of the Gulfe of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / 
the patrones ſayde one to a nother / if it
fortune that we be driuen a ſonder by force of
wynde and wether / than lette vs drawe to the

the laſt came / and or all coulde aſſemble there
togyder it was a nyne daies. This iſle of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meres

There the lordes refreſſhed theym and than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

counſayle &amp; aduyſe of hym / for he was experte
and ſubtyle in all feates of armes / both in ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge / 
ſealynge / and ſtealynge of fortreſſes.
The ſeconde reaſon was / the erle feared that if
this Aymergot ſhulde a byde behynde in the

fortreſſe of Aloyſe and other fortreſſes / yet he
might do moche domage in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uergne

I ſe the certayne of the erle of Armynakes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partyng / 
than I knowe myne owne wyll is ſo

nat been / that letted hym a ſeaſon / for dyuers

had promyſed hym / and this voyage in

<pb n="cxcv" facs="tcp:22067:209"/>
his voyage. Whan tydynges was knowen in
Fraunce of the treaties that the erle of Army<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nake
had made with the ſayde capytayns in
Auuergne / there was made as moche haſte as
myght be to pay the money to the capytayns.</p>
            <p>Aymergot Marſell was ſore dyſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with hym ſelfe in that he had ſolde
and deliuered the ſtronge caſtell of Aloyſe / for
he ſawe his owne auctorite therby greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated / 
and parceyued well howe he was the
leſſe feared / for all the ſeaſon that he kept it he
was doubted and feared / and honoured with
all men of warre of his parte / and had kept a
great aſtate alwayes in the caſtell of Aloyſe.
The pateſynge of countreys that he helde vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
ſubiection / was well worth yerely twenty
thouſande florayns. Whan he remembred all
this he was ſoroufull / his treſour he thought

It is trewe quod Aymergot / I knowe

Aymergote auewed the place to ſe if it were

He was brought to hym / and whan he came

he wolde nat be diſhonored / and there
he gaue hym ten frankes / and than departed

he had ben at Calyſet and at Douſacke / and
what anſwere he had of the capitayns. than
the Vicount prayſed moche Perotte le Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyes

            <p>THe ſiege beyng before the Roche of

of the garyſon was greatlye to the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

And the capitayne of them without is

And bycauſe I am in doute what aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere

Therfore deſyre that I maye haue in lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe

            <p>WHan Aymergot Marcell &amp; Guyot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>du

The varlet departed by nyght and
was well accompanyed and conueyed a fote
to another fortreſſe ꝑteynynge to Aymergot
called ſaint Soupery. There he toke a horſe
ſuche as he wolde choſe / for he hadde a great

than toke his iourney to Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don. And it was
his fortune that the kynge of Englande and
his two vncles / and the duke of Lancaſtre

there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> varlet delyuered hym his letters. the

Than the varlet ſhewed hym all the hole ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter /

herde hym well / and demaunded if he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

And whan he ſawe the hour and tyme he mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued

Whan he had ſaid as moche as he wolde / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he was anſwered / that the kyng wolde take
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle in the mater and make an anſwere.
Than he went out of the counſayle chambre
and taryed tyll he had an anſwere.</p>
            <p>THe aunſwere was / that the kynge
wolde write to the vycount of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aulx

accordyng as Aymergot had requyred / and
in lykewiſe ſo promyſed the duke of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre.
and whan the letters were writen / there
was a gentylman of the duke of Lancaſtres
apoynted to bere theſe letters. So they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

he was aquaynted with the lordes of Auuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gne /

The gentylman of the duke of Lancaſters

bycauſe the varlette promyſed hym in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe

Whanne they were nere

But they ſent the varlet in to the towne / ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng

            <p>WHan they were departed they toke the

what they were / they anſwered that they were

Whan they came there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Berrey with

the harauld was knowen with dyuers. Than
they were brought to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke / who for the loue

delyuered his letters to the duke / who recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

<pb facs="tcp:22067:214"/>
anſwered them curteſly and ſayde. Syrs for
the loue of our coſyns in Englande we ſhall
gladly do our power. Of the which aunſwere
the ſquyer and the haraulde were ryght ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe

and theſe letters were red or they were
ſealed before the englyſſhe men / who thought
them well ordayned. Theſe letters were ſente
by a notable ſquyer of the duke of Berreys to
the vycount of Meaulx / who receyued them

ſpeke royally and truely / and we ſhall abyde
with you / but we ſuppoſe the occaſion that the
duke of Berrey writeth thus for Aymergot / is
that the englyſſh ſquier and the haraulde hath
thus deſyred him to write. we thinke alſo they
haue brought letters to hym fro the kynge of
Englande / and fro the duke of Lancaſtre / as
they brought to you this other day. ye ſay well
quod the vicounte / and I ſhall knowe it if I

ſent for to haue his anſwere / and the vycount
ſayd to him. Pyer / I wyll well that ye knowe

that we ſhulde reyſe our ſiege / by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that we ſay generally that we ſhal gyue

to contynewe it tyll I haue the fortreſſe and
them within at my pleaſure / whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente
I dare nat brake. and ſay that ſurely
I wyll obey to no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement / but alone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the kynges whoſe ſubget Iame / and by
whome I am ſente hyther. But ſir I requyre
you ſhewe me one thynge if ye can / who hath
made this requeſt for Aymergotte Marcell / 
who hath done ſo moche yuell and anoyaunce
to the countrey of Auuergne and Lymoſyn / 
and nowe he is atrapped lyke as a traytoure
ſhulde be / and is nere come to an yuell ende / 
whiche he hathe well deſerued / for he hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and done contrary to his othe. Syr quod
the ſquyer / there came to my lorde the duke of
Berrey two men of Englande / an haraulde
and another / who brought letters to my lorde
fro the kynge of Englande and fro the duke
of Lancaſtre / and they made greate requeſt
for Aymergotte. I beleue you well quod the
<pb n="cc" facs="tcp:22067:214"/>
vycounte / it was Derby the haraulde and a
ſquyer called Herbery / they brought me this
other daye lyke letters / wherfore I ſuppoſe
that the kynge of Englande and the duke of
Lancaſtre wrote to the duke of Berrey in this
mater. wherfore ſhewe to my lorde of Berrey
that I deſyre him to conſydre all thinges well / 
for all theſe requeſtes that are come fro the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſyde of the ſee / are but deſyres purchaſed
by our enemyes / to the which no lorde on this
ſyde the ſee (if he loue the honoure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
of the realme of Fraunce) ſhulde enclyne
nor condyſcende. Sir quod the ſquyer I ſhall
forget nothynge of that ye haue ſhewed me / 
for I loue nat Aymergot / I had rather ſe his
punyſſhmente thanne his delyueraunce. So
the Squyer departed and rode to Nonecte
where he founde the duke of Berrey / and dyd
his meſſage ryght ſagely / the concluſyon was
that the vycounte of Meaulx ſayde / ſurely he
<abbr>wold</abbr> nat departe fro the ſiege before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Roche
of Vandoys / without the kynge ſente hym
ſtrayte commaundemente ſo to do. With this
aunſwere the duke of Berrey was nat well
contente / he had thought that as well his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement
ſhulde haue been obeyed / ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyally
in Auuergne.</p>
            <p>WHan the englyſſhe ſquyer and Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the haraulde herde of the anſwere
that was made to the duke of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey / 
and howe that the ſiege was nat rayſed / 
they were ſory / and ſawe well they traueyled
in vayne / than they ſayde to the duke. Syr
what wyll ye counſayle vs to do / ſhall we thus
departe frome you without ſpedynge of any
thynge to purpoſe. The kynge of Englande
and the duke of Lancaſtre haue great truſte
and affyaunce in you / that ye <abbr>ſhuld</abbr> cauſe this
ſiege to be reyſed / bycauſe the Roche of Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doys
is vnder our ſignoury. Syrs quod the
duke ſuffre a ſeaſon / Aymergot Marcell is in
a ſtronge place / he nedeth nat to feare takyng / 
without a great vnhappe / and ſhortely I pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe
to goo in to Fraunce to the kynge / and
thanne I wyll ſpeke with the Kynge and his
counſayle / and for the loue of my coſyns of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande / 
I ſhall do the beſte I canne to bringe
the matter to paſſe / and ye ſhall go with me
and ſe howe I ſhall ſpede. With thoſe wordes
the Squyer and the haraulde were contente.
Than the fourth day after the duke departed
fro Nonecte / and lefte there the ducheſſe his
wyfe with a gret parte of his houſeholde / and
ſo the duke rode to Ryon in Auuergne / and
there he taryed more thanne eyght dayes / for
the erle of Sanxere and the lorde Rule / who
were gone to Auignon aboute the dukes bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyneſſe.
and whan they were come they depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
fro Ryon all togyther / and toke the waye
throughe Burbonoys / and at laſte came to
Bourges in Berrey / and there the duke ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
two dayes. Than he rode to Mehun on
the ryuer of yeure to a caſtell / one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayreſt
houſes of the worlde / as thanne the duke had
newly bylte it / and it had coſte hym thre hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſande frankes. There the duke ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
fyftene dayes / wherwith the Englyſſhe
meſſangers were ſore troubled / howbeit they
coude fynde none other remedy. The duke as
than made lytell force for the delyueraunce of
Aymergot / I ſhall ſhewe you howe and by
what meanes. So it was the erle of Sanxere
and the lorde of Rule who were chefe of the du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
counſayle / with ſyr Peter Meſpyn / they
in fayre maner blamed the duke / and ſayde
howe he hadde nothinge to do to medell with
the buſyneſſe of Aymergot / ſayenge that his
lyfe hathe been alwayes dyſhonourable / and
howe that he was but a falſe palyarte / and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
agaynſte the crowne of Fraunce / and
had doone many vyllayne dedes and robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
in Auuergne and in Lymoſyn / and how
that he was no mete parſone to be entreated
for / wherfore ſyr quod they / ſuffre the kynge
and his counſayle to deale with hym as they
lyſte. Theſe wordes and ſuche other refray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the duke of Berrey to ſpeke any further in
the mater. Howe be it the two englyſſhe men
dyd their beſt to remembre the duke. And the
duke diſſymulynge aunſwered them curteſſy
and ſayde. Syrs ſuffre a ſeaſon / we ſhall be
ſhortely at Parys. but for all his wordes he ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryed
ſtyll at Mehun more thanne thre wekes
deuyſynge with his mayſter workeman: as
keruers and paynters / for therin he had great
fantaſy. He had a mayſter workeman called
maiſter Andrewe / as than one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt worke
men of the worlde / an Englyſſhe man borne / 
but he dwelte in Fraunce and in Haynalte a
longe ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Nowe ſhall I ſhewe you what fortuned of
Aymergot Marcell / and of the roche of Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doys
<pb facs="tcp:22067:215"/>
This Aymergot was a farre caſtynge
man / and whan he ſawe that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſiege was nat
reyſed / he thought well that the kyng of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glandes
meſſangers coude nat ſpede of their
ſute. than he thought on another turne as to
departe thens and to ryde nyght and daye to
ſpeke with the capitaynes of Piergourt / and
Pyerguyſe / and with Guyot of ſaint Fayth / 
and Ernalton of ſaynt Calombe / &amp; Ernalton
of Roſtem / Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Morſen / Pier Danchin / 
and Remonet of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>payne / and with dyuers
other gaſcoyns and bernoyſe in the englyſſhe
garyſons / and he thought that with his fayre
wordes he <abbr>ſhuld</abbr> cauſe them to aſſemble togy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther / 
and to come in to Auuergne on truſte to
wynne great botyes / and ſo on a mornyng or
in the night to come and reyſe the ſiege before
Vandoys / and to take there the frenche men
priſoners / whiche ſhulde be worthe to them a
hundred thouſande frankes / beſyde other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes.
Thanne he ſhewed his vncle Guyot du
Sall all his purpoſe / who anſwered him and
ſayd. Sir I ſe in this nothynge but good / for
otherwyſe we can nat be delyuered fro theſe
frenche men. Well vncle ꝙ Aymergot I ſhall
do this meſſage my ſelfe ſyth ye counſayle me
therto / but I ſhall deſyre you of one thynge or
I departe. What is that quod he. It is ſo quod
Aymergot / that what ſo euer ſkrymyſſhe that
the frenche men do make / iſſue you in no wyſe
out of the gates / nor open nat your barryers / 
for and ye do / ye may rather leſe than wynne.
Sir quod Guyot I ſhalbe ware ynough ther
of / we ſhall kepe our ſelfes cloſe here within
tyll your retourne / or that we here tydynges
fro you. Well fayre vncle I requyre you ſo to
do / for they canne nat diſpleaſe vs none / other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes / 
as for their aſſautes or ſkrymyſſhes / 
ye nede nat feare / ſo ye kepe your ſelfes cloſe
within. Thus within thre dayes after Aymer
gote departed fro the Roche of Vandoys all
onely aco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyed with a page / he paſſed forth
without daunger of the frenche men. his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſyon
was to brynge thyder companyons
aduenturers to rayſe the ſiege. many of them
that were within the houſe knewe nothyng of
his departure / for he myght departe whan he
loſt without knowlege. Euery day there was
ſkrymyſſhynge and aſſautes at the barryers / 
and within a fyue or ſixe dayes after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Aymergot / there was a great aſſaute
made by the frenche men in thre partes. This
Guyot du Sall was a good man of armes / 
and longe tyme had vſed the exerciſyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of / 
howe be it as on that day he fortuned yuell
by reaſon of a lytell pryde / for he brake the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynaunce
that his coſyn Aymergot had ſet or
he departed / for he had charged hym that for
any maner of aſſaute he ſhulde nat iſſue out of
the barryers. At this aſſaute there were thre
ſquyers of the french party / two of Auuergne
and one of Bretayne / who were ſkrimyſſhing
valyauntly vpon a pane of a wall nere to the
fortreſſe. Theſe thre ſquyers aboue all other
that daye dyd moſte valyauntly / they of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergne
were called Rycharde de la Violecte / 
and Lubinet of Rochfort / and the breton was
named Monadyke / who was taken before in
Lymoſyn in the caſtell of Vanchador / &amp; was
parteynynge to ſir Willyam Butler. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaute
endured tyll nyght. Theſe thre ſquyers
atcheued there great laude and prayſe / but for
all their traueyle &amp; payne they wan nothyng.
Than at another aſſaute the vicount of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aulx
made a buſſhment of twelue men of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
and their companyes / and layde them in
an olde houſe without the fortreſſe / and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
another ſorte to go and ſkrymyſſhe
at the barryers / ſayenge I thynke ſurely we
ſhall ſe them within iſſue out / for they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſe
to wyn. if they do ſo / than withdrawe
your ſelfe lyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll and lytell tyll they be paſt our
buſſhment / than they ſhall breke out / and alſo
retourne you agayne / thus they ſhall be enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and taken or ſlayne. This is the beſt way
that I can ſe for our aduauntage. thus as the
vicount had deuyſed &amp; ordeyned it was done / 
they were named that ſhulde lye in the buſſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / 
as Loys of Leſglynell / Robert of Ber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tencourte / 
Guylliam de Saulſoy / Pyer du
ſaynt Vydall / Guyonet Villeracque / Pier of
Colle / and Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Salmage / with other to the
nombre of twelue. They layde themſelfe in an
olde houſe without the fortreſſe / and another
ſorte went and ſkrimyſſhed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barryers / as
Belynot of Rochfort / Rycharde of Violecte / 
and the Monadyke with other. They were
freſſhly armed and aparelled / to thentent that
they within ſhulde haue the more corage to iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
out to them / they were alſo twelue alonly.
Whan they came to the bartyers they began
to ſkrymyſſhe but fayntly / and lyke ſuche per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſones
as coulde but lytell ſkyll of feates of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
Wherfore Guyot du Sall made lytell
<pb n="cci" facs="tcp:22067:215"/>
force of them / but iſſued out and ſayde to his
companyons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſaynt Marcell we wyll iſſue
out / for at the barryers be a ſorte of yonge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyons / 
for by that they ſhewe / they knowe
but lytell of dedes of armes / but we ſhall teche
them to knowe it / they ſhalbe all our priſoners
they can nat eſcape vs. Therwith they opened
the barryers and iſſued out / fyrſte Guyot du
Sall / and remembred nochynge the charge
that Aymergot had gyuen hym at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge / 
for the great deſyre that he had to do de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
of armes / and to wynne ſomwhat / made
him to begyn the ſkrymyſſhe. whan the french
men ſawe that Guyot du Sall and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were come out of their barryers / they
were ryght ioyfull / than they began to drawe
backe lytell and lytell / and they of the fortreſſe
purſewed them / and they wente ſo farre that
they paſſed the buſſhment / &amp; whan they ſawe
their tyme they brake out of their buſſhment / 
bytwene them and the fortres / cryeng Coucy
the vycount. Thus they of the fortreſſe were
incloſed both before and <abbr>behynd.</abbr> whan Guy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ot
ſawe that / he knewe well he had doone a
myſſe / and ſawe well it was harde for hym to
ſcape / than he reculed to get agayne to his ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryſon / 
but the frenchemen were in his waye.
Whervnto ſhulde I make longe proceſſe / they
were all taken / nat one eſcaped. They were
brought to the vycountes lodginge before the
knyghtes / who hadde great ioye of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge.</p>
            <p>THus by the counſayle of the bycount
of Meaulx / Guyot du Sall and his
company were atrapped &amp; taken and brought
before the lordes of Fraunce and Auuergne.
Whan the vycount ſawe Guyot du Sall / he
demaunded where Aymergot Marcell was / 
and charged hym to ſaye the trouthe / for he
thought he had ben ſtill in the fortreſſe. Guyot
du Sall aunſwered / howe he coulde nat tell
where he was / for he was departed a twelue
dayes paſte. Than the lordes thought ſurely
that he was gone to purchace ſome ayde. than
the priſoners were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded a parte / and
the vicount demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of the knightes of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergne
what were beſte to do with Guyot du
Sall and with his company / ſayenge howe
he wolde vſe hymſelfe acordyng to their coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayle.
Than ſyr Willyam Butler aunſwered
and ſayde. Syr quod he / I ſuppoſe that Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergot

This Aymergot is a ſubtyle man. ſyr let vs

to be rendred in to your handes / that ye
wyll ſtryke of all their heedes incontynente / 
and without they do thus let it nat be ſpared.
This counſayle is good quod the vycounte / 
for in dede the chefe occaſyon that we become
hyder for is to haue this fortreſſe / and though
we can nat haue at this tyme Aymergot Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell / 
another ſeaſon ſhall fortune ryght well.
Than the vycount and the lorde of the towre / 
ſyr Roberte Dolphyn and other came before
the fortreſſe as nere as they myght aporche / 
and thyder was brought Guyot du Sall and
his company. Than the vycount ſpake and
ſayd to Guyot du Sall. Guyot and all other
of your company / knowe we for trouthe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contynent
all your heedes ſhall be ſtryken of / 
without ye yelde vp the fortreſſe of the Roche
of Vandoys / and if ye wyll rendre it vp we
ſhall ſuffre you to go quyte. Nowe aduyſe ye
well what way ye wyll take / other lyfe or deth.
Of thoſe wordes Guyot &amp; his company were
ſore abaſſhed / at laſt they thought it was beſt
for them to ſaue their lyues. Than Guyot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
and ſayde. Syr I ſhall do the beſt I
canne that the fortreſſe may be yelden to you.
Than he came to the barryer and ſpake with
them that were within / who rekened themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes
clene dyſcomfyted / ſeynge they hadde loſt
their two mayſters / and the beſt of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
As ſoone as Guyot hadde ſpoken with

they agreed to yelde vp the fortreſſe condicio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally / 
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they myght departe with bagge and

haue reſpyte for a moneth to withdrawe them
whyther they lyſte. All this was graunted to
them / and a ſute ſaueconducte made and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Thus the frenche men had the Roche of
Vandoys delyuered / by reaſon of their good

of this dede came to the knowledge

howe it fortuned. It was ſhewed
hym howe it was by reaſon of a ſkrymyſſhe / 
and by the iſſuyng out of his vncle Guyot du

Thus all thynge conſydred I am in a harde

houres without paryll or dommage at their

that the Englyſſhe men had been a lande / in

The ſarazyns came to awake and to

their maner in ſkrymyſſhynge. Thus the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razyns
drewe to their lodgynge and the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
men to theirs. And durynge the ſiege the
cryſten men were neuer in ſuretie nor reſt / for
outher euenynge or mornynge the ſarazyns
wolde awake them and ſkrymyſſhe. Amonge
the ſarazyns there was a yonge knight called
Agadingor Dolyferne / he was alwayes well
mounted on a redy and a lyght horſe / it ſemed
whan the horſe ranne / that he dyd flye in the
ayre. The knyght ſemed to be a good man of
armes by his dedes / he bare always of vſage
thre fedred dartes / and ryght well he coulde
handle them / and acordynge to their cuſtome
he was clene armed with a long whyte to well
aboute his heed. His aparell was blacke / and
his owne coloure browne / and a good horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
The cryſten men ſayde they thought he
dyd ſuche dedes for the loue of ſome yonge la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
of his countrey. And trewe it was that he
loued entyrely the kynge of Thunes dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / 
named the lady Azala / ſhe was enhery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
to the realme of Thunes / after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſceaſe
of the kyng her father. This Agadingor was
ſonne to the duke of Olyferne. I can nat tell if
they were maryed togyther after or nat / but
it was ſhewed me that this knyght for loue of
the ſayd lady durynge the ſiege dyd many fea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
of armes. The knyghtes of Faunce wolde
fayne haue taken hym / but they coulde neuer
atrape nor encloſe him / his horſe was ſo ſwyft
and ſo redy to his hande y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alwaies he ſkaped.</p>
            <p>THe cryſten men wolde gladly haue
taken ſome ſarazyn to the entente to
haue knowen the ſtate of the towne
and countrey / but for all their ſkrymyſſhynge
they coulde neuer gette none. The ſaraſyns
toke good hede to themſelfe / and dyd paueſſe
themſelfe agaynſt the croſebowes genouoys / 
they werenat ſo well armed as the criſten men
it was nat their vſage / nor they had no armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
nor metall to forge harneſſe withall / for
moſt comenly they lacke yron and ſteele / they
be euer armed in lether / and beare targettes a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boute
their neckes couered and made of Cure
boley of Capadoce / no wepen can perce it and
the lether be nat hote. ſo that whan they come
nere to their enemyes they caſt their dartes all
at ones. And whan the genouoys do ſhote at
theym / than they couche them ſelfe lowe and
couer them with their targes / and whan the
ſhotte is paſte / than they caſte agayne their fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred

durynge the ſiege they often tymes ſkrymyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed / 
ſo that dyuers were hurte on bothe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties /

one thynge amonge them to be marueyled at / 
I ſhall ſhewe you what.</p>
            <p>THe ſarazyns within the towne of Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fryke
had great marueyle by what
tytell or inſtaunce y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the cryſten men

It was ſhewed me howe they toke aduyſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
them howe to knowe the trouth therof / 
and determyned to ſende to the cryſten men to
knowe their myndes / and ſo toke a truchman
that coulde ſpeke Italyan / and commaunded
hym to go to the cryſten hoſt / and to demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
of them in what tytle and inſtaunce they are
come to make vs warre / and why they be come
ſo ſtrongly in to the empyre of Barbary / and
in to the lande of Auffryke / and ſaye howe we
haue in nothynge treſpaſed them. of a trouth
afore this tyme there hath ben warre bytwene
vs and the genouoys / but as for that warre
by reaſon ought nat to touche the cryſten men
of farre countreys of. as for the genouoys are
our neyghbours / they take of vs and we of
them / we haue been auncyente enemyes and

with this meſſage the trucheman departed / 
and rode to the cryſten army / and mette fyrſt
with a genoway / and ſhewed hym howe he
was a meſſanger ſent fro y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſarazyns to ſpeke
<pb facs="tcp:22067:220"/>
with ſome lorde of Fraunce. The genoway
had to name Anthony Marthy / he was a cen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turyon
of the croſbowes / he brought this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanger
to the duke of Burbon and to the lorde
of Coucy / who gladly herde hym ſpeke / and
the wordes that he ſpake in his owne langage
the centuryon genoway expowned theym in
frenche. Whan this meſſanger had declared
his meſſage / he deſyred to haue an anuſwere.
The lordes of Fraunce ſayde he ſhulde haue / 
but firſt they wolde take aduyſe in the mater.
Than a .xii. of the greateſt lordes drewe togy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
to counſayle in the duke of Burbons tent / 
and concluded / and ſo ſent for the meſſanger / 
and the genouoy made him his anſwere in al

            <p>ANone after the ſarazyns toke coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle

a ſeuen or eight dayes togyther they

and than ſodaynly on a nyght about the hour
of mydnyght to ſette on the hooſt / truſtynge
therby to do a great feate. As they ordayned
ſo they dyd / and an eyght dayes togyther they

            <p>As the ſarazyns aproched they ſawe ſodenly

damoſels / all in whyte colour / and one in eſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyall
who in beauty without compariſon exce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
all the other / and there was borne before
her a baner all of whyte and reed within. with
this ſyght the ſarazyns were ſo abaſſhed that
they lacked ſpyrite and force to go any further
and ſo ſtode ſtyll / and the ladyes before them.
Alſo it was ſhewed me that the Genouoys
had a great dogge in their company that they
brought with theym / but they knewe nat fro
whence he came / there was none that chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the dogge to be his / whiche dogge dyd
theym great ſeruyce / for the ſarazyns coulde
neuer come ſo pryuely to ſkrymyſſhe / but the
dogge wolde bay and make ſuche brewte that

the dogge baye / that the ſarazyns were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
to ſkrymyſſhe with them / wherby euer
they aparelled them ſelfe to reſyſt them. The
genouoys called the dogge our ladies dogge.
The ſame ſeaſon that the ſarazyns ſtode ſtyll
in a traunce / and the ladyes before them this
dogge was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and ranne bayeng fyrſt to the ſtande watche / 
the lorde of Coucy and ſir Henry Dantoigne
kept the watche that night. Whan euery man
herde this dogge make ſuche brute they roſe
and armed them redy / for they knew well that
the ſarazyns dyd aproche to awake them. and
trewe it was that the vyrgyn Mary and her
company was before them / to defende the cry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſten
men fro all parelles / ſo that they toke that

and ſayd. Syr in your wordes is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
but honour / to morowe if ye wyll ryde
and be in the former fronte of the batayle with
a trucheman with you / and make ſome token
that ye wolde ſpeke with ſome cryſten man / 
and than do you ſo moche as to offre the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle
of .x. of yours agaynſt ten of theirs / than
ſhall ye here and ſe what they wyll aunſwere / 
and yet howe ſo euer they anſwere we may be
aduyſed what we wyll do / at leſte the cryſten
men ſhall repute vs the more valyaunt. They
all agreed to that apoyntmente / and ſo paſſed
that nyght. the next mornyng they rode forth
to ſkrymyſſhe with their enemyes / and Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingor
formeſt / mounted on his good horſe / 
<pb n="ccvii" facs="tcp:22067:221"/>
and his trucheman with him. The daye was
clere and bright / and a lytell before the ſonne
ryſynge / the ſarazyns ſet them ſelfe in ordre of
batayle. The ſame nyght ſir Willyam of Tre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moyle
had kept the watch on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cryſten parte / 
and with hym ſir Guy his brother. Than the
ſarazins apered before the criſten men within
a thre croſbowe ſhot / and Agadingor had his
truchman by him / he rode on before all his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany / 
and made token to ſpeke with ſome cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
man / on the one wynge of the felde. And a
gentle ſquyer called Affrenall / ſeyng the ſara<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zyn
and the ſygnes that he made / rode fro his
company &amp; ſayd. Syrs ſtande ſtyll here / and
I wyll go and ſpeke with yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſarazyn / and
torne agayne to you / he hath a truchman with
hym / he cometh to ſpeke with ſome man. this
ſquier came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſarazyn / who taryed for him.
Than the truchman ſaid / ye cryſten man. are
a noble man and a man of armes / and redy to
gyue aunſwere to our demaunde? I am ſuche
a one quod Affrenall / ſay what it pleace you / 
ye ſhalbe harde and receyued. Than quod the
trucheman / ſyr beholde here a gentleman and
a noble man of ours / who demaundeth the ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayle
to fyght with you hande to hande / and if
ye wyll haue mo / we ſhall fynde to the nombre
of ſixe of ours redy to fight with .vi. of yours / 
and the quarell of our men ſhalbe this. They
ſay and wyll iuſtifye that our faythe is better
and more of valure than yours / for our faythe
and lawe hath ben written ſyth the begynning
of the worlde / and as for your lawe was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
out by one man / whome the iewes hanged on
a croſſe. Ahſyr quod Affrenall / ſpeke no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of that mater / it appertaygneth nat to the
to ſpeke or diſpute our fayth and lawe. but ſay
to this ſarazyn / that he ſwere by his fayth and
beleue to afferme the batayle / &amp; let hym bringe
to the nombre of .x. all gentlemen of name and
armes / and within this thre houres I ſhall
bringe as many to try the mater. The truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
reſyted thoſe wordes to the ſarazyn / who
be ſemyng had gret ioy to accept and afferme
the batayle. Thus they toke this enterpriſe by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene
them twayne and departed / and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to their owne companyes. tydinges herof
came to ſir Guy of Tremoyle and to ſyr Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyam
his brother / and whan they met with Af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>frenall
they demaunded fro whence he came / 
and what he had done with the ſarazyn. Than
Affrenall ſhewed hym all the hole mater / and
how that he had taken the batayle / wherof the
ſayd two knightes were ioyfull and ſayd. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frenall
ſpeke to other / for we two ſhall be of the
nombre of the ten. ſyr quod Affrenall / as god
wyll ſo be it / I truſt I ſhall fynde ynowe that
wolde be glad to fyght with the ſarazyns. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none
after Affrenall mette with the lorde of
Thune / and ſhewed hym the aduenture / and
demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded if he wolde be one of the company.
The <abbr>lord</abbr> of Thune wolde nat refuſe but glad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
graunted to be one of their company. For
euery one that Affrenall dyd gette / he myght
haue goten a .C. if he had wolde. Sir Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyquant
the yonger / ſyr Helyons of Lingnac / 
ſyr Iohan Ruſſell englyſſhe / ſir Iohan Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedon / 
Aleys Bodet / and Bochet / all theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the batayle. Whan the nombre of ten
were accompliſſhed euery man drewe to their
lodgynge to arme them incontynent to do ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayle.
Whan this was knowen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hooſt / and
the knyghtes named that had taken on them
that enterpriſe. Than all other knyghtes and
ſquyers ſayd. a theſe ten knightes were borne
in a good houre / that haue founde this day ſo
happy an aduenture. wolde to god quod dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
that we were of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nombre. Euery knight
and ſquyer was ioyfull of this enterpriſe / and
greatly prayſed the aduenture / ſauynge the
gentle lorde of Coucy / who was nat cotente
therwith.</p>
            <p>THe lorde of Thune was of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the lorde of coucy / he ſhewed him
the couenante he had made with Affrenall / to
be one of the ten to fight with ten ſarazyns. as
many as herde therof prayſed greatly that ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenture / 
but the lorde of Coucy ſpake againſt
it and ſayd. Ah ſirs ye yonge people y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knowe
but lytell of the worlde / but rather exalte a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſhe
ded than a wyſe dede. In this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
I can ſe no reaſon for dyuers cauſes. one
is that ten knyghtes and ſquyers of our men / 
all gentlemen of name and blode / muſt fyght
agaynſte as many ſarazyns. Howe ſhall our
men knowe whether they be gentlemen or no?
if they lyſt they may ſet agaynſt our men ten
rybauldes or varlettes / and if they hap to be
dyſcomfyted / we ſhall wyn nothynge but ten
varlettes / and yet we ſhall be neuer the nerer
to wyn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne of Aufryke / but we ſhall thus
put our good men in adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture. peraduenture
they wyll ſet a buſſhment / and whan our ten
<pb facs="tcp:22067:222"/>
men be in the felde to tary for their men / they
wyll cloſe them rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de about / wherby we ſhall
leſe them and be ſomoche the febler. There I
ſay quod the lorde of Coucy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Affrenall hath
nat wrought wyſely in this mater / for at the
firſt whan the ſarazyn dyd defye him he <abbr>ſhuld</abbr>
than haue made a nother maner of aunſwere
than he dyd. he ſhuld haue ſayd howe he was
nat the chefe heed of that army / but rather one
of the pooreſt / &amp; where as ye blame our faythe
and byleue / ye are nat mete to haue an anſwer
made to you therof by me / but if ye lyſt I ſhall
brynge you to the great lordes of our armye / 
and I ſhall take you vnder my ſaueconducte / 
that ye ſhall go and returne in ſauegarde and
ſuretie / and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ye ſhall here the lordes ſpeke.
Thus Affrenall <abbr>ſhuld</abbr> haue ledde the ſarazyn
to the duke of Burbone and to the counſayle / 
and there he ſhulde haue been herde at leyſer / 
and anſwered by good aduyſe / ſuche defyau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in armes for ſuche quarell ought nat to paſſe
without great deliberacion of good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle.
And than if the batayle had ben agreed vnto
by vs / yet it wolde haue ben knowen of them
what men by name and ſurname ſhulde acom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plyſſh
the batayle. Thervpon we to haue cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſen
other of our men for our honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite / 
and thervpon to hane had of the ſarazyns
ſuretie and hoſtage / and they of vs. This had
ben a more metely maner to haue vſed / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if this treatie might be withdrawen with
reaſon / it ſhulde be well doone / and I wyll go
and ſpeke with the duke of Burbone / and to
take counſayle with the lordes of the armye / 
and to knowe what they wyll ſay therto. thus
the lorde of Coucy departed fro the lorde of
Thune / and wente to the Duke of Burbons
tent / where all the barons aſſembled togyder
to take cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle in that mater. For all that the
lorde of Coucy had ſayde theſe wordes to the
lorde of Thune / by maner of good counſayle
and aduyſe / yet for all that he lefte nat / but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
hymſelfe / and ſo came forth with other of
his company redy to fight with the ſarazyns / 
and ſir Guy of Tremoyle the formeſt knight.
Thus the lordes of Fraunce were in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle
in the duke of Burbons tent. Some thought
this defiaunce to be reaſonable / and ſuſteyned
greatly the wordes and opinyon of the lorde
Coucy / ſayeng howe it were better to make a
nother maner of treatie. And ſome other / as
ſpecyall the lorde Loys erle of Arthoys / and
ſir Philyp of Bare ſayd. Syth the armes be
taken and accepted on our parte / it ſhulde be
great blame to let it / wherfore in the name of
god and our lady let our knyghtes and ſquy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
furnyſſhe their enterpriſe. This purpoſe
was holden and ſuſteyned / but than all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
conſydred / it was thought for the beſt that
all the hole hoſt ſhulde be armed / and be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre
of batayle / to thentent that if the ſarazyns
wolde do any falſneſſe they ſhulde be redy to
reſyſt them. This was accomplyſſhed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man well armed / and drewe in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> felde
in good ordre of batayle redy to fyght / the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouoys
croſebowes on the one ſyde / and the
knyghtes and ſquiers on the other ſyde / euery
lord vnder his baner or penon of their armes / 
it was a goodly ſyght to beholde them. The
cryſten men ſhewed well howe they had great
deſyre that the ſarazyns <abbr>ſhuld</abbr> haue come and
fought with them. And the ten cryſten knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and ſquiers were redy in the felde aloue of
fro their company / abydynge for the ten ſara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins
that ſhulde haue fought with them / but it
ſemed well they had no wyll therto / for whan
they ſawe howe the cryſten men ordred them
ſelfe &amp; were redy in batayle / they douted them
and durſt nat come forwarde / for all that they
were thre tymes as many men as the cryſten
men were. The ſaraſyns wolde often tymes
come well mounted / and ſkrymyſſh before the
cryſten mennes batayle / and than returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
and this they dyd of pure malice to put
the cryſten men to payne and traueyle. This
day was ſo hote with the ſonne / that before nor
after there had been no ſuche ſene / ſo that they
that were moſte luſty and freſſhe were ſo ſore
chafed in their harneſſe that they were nere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
for faute of ayre and wynde. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the .x. cryſten men taryed a parte for the
ten ſarazyns / but they nother ſawe nor herde
tydynges of any. Than they aduyſed to apro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
the towne of Aufryke and to aſſayle it / ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
they were all redy armed and redy in ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayle.
And all day to kepe their honour the ten
knightes kept the felde tyll it was night. there
went to the aſſaute knyghtes and ſquyers / de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyringe
to do dedes of armes / they were hote
and ſore chafed / and yet they traueyled them
ſelfe more and more. And if the ſaraſyns had
well knowen what caſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cryſten men were in / 
they might haue done the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great domage / and
a reyſed the ſiege / and by lykelyhode to haue
<pb n="ccviii" facs="tcp:22067:222"/>
had the victory / for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cryſten men were ſo we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

ſtrenght / howe be it they conquered by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaute
the firſt wall of the towne where no man
dwelte. Than the ſarazyns retrayed in to the
ſeconde fortreſſe / ſkrymyſſhynge without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
of any great domage / but the cryſten

ſquiers in dyuers cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys apparelled them
ſelfes to be at this feeſt / ſome to ſe the maner

and ſpecially the lorde of Gomegynes
bycauſe he was well acquaynted with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyſſhe

purpoſed whyle he made his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon
to go in to Hollande to ſe his father Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berte / 
erle of Heynaulte / Hollande / and ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande / 
to the entente to ſpeke with hym / and
to take leaue to go in to Englande. He deꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fro Queſnoy in Haynault / and rode tyll
he came to Haye in Hollande / where the erle
his father was at that tyme. and there he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed
his father his purpoſe that he was in to
go in to Englande to ſe the countrey &amp; his co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyns / 
whom he had neuer ſene. Than therle
his father anſwered and ſayd. Wyllyam my

wherfore ye nede nat to ſeke none other aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce.
Dere father quod he / I wyll nat go

in to Englande to make any alyau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. I do it
but to feeſt and make myrthe with my coſins
there / whom as yet I neuer ſawe, &amp; bycauſe
the feeſt whiche ſhalbe holden at London / is
publiſſhed abrode. wherfore ſyth I am ſigni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyed
therof &amp; ſhulde nat go thyder / it ſhulde
be ſayd I were proude &amp; preſuptuous / wher
fore in the ſauynge of myne honoure I wyll
go thider / therfore dere father I requyre you
agree therto. Sonne quod he do as ye lyſte / 
but I thynke ſurely it were better that ye ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
at home. Whan the erle of Oſtrenaunt
ſawe that his wordes contented nat his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / 
he wolde ſpeke no more therof / but fell
in other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municacion. But he thought well
ynough what he wolde do / and ſo dayly ſent
his prouiſyon towardes Calais. Gomegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
the heraulde was ſente in to Englande
fro therle of Oſtrenaunt / to gyue knowlege
to kynge Rycharde and to his vncles / howe
that he wolde come honorably to his feeſt at
London. Of thoſe tidynges the kynge and
his vncles were ryght ioyouſe / and gaue to
the heraulde great giftes / whiche after ſtode
hym in great ſtede. For after in the ende of
his dayes he fell blynde / I can nat tell if god

he lyued marueylouſly / wherfore in his
olde dayes and that he hadde loſte his ſyght
there were but fewe that were ſorte therof.
Thus the erle of Oſtrenaunt departed from
Haye in Hollande / and toke leaue of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / 
and ſo retourned to Queſnoy in Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naulte
to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teſſe his wyfe.</p>
            <p>THis noble feeſt wherof I make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of Englandes ſuſter. He prepared greatly
to go in to Englande / and ſo came to Calys.
And alſo the erle Oſtrenaunt departed fro
Heynaulte / well accompanyed with knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and ſquyers / and ſo paſſed throughe the
countrey of Arthoys / and came alſo to Calis
and there he founde the erle of ſaynt Poule /

tidynges of the realme of Fraunce. He aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

paſſed ouer on a thurſdaye and ſo ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
to Cauterbury / and on the friday he viſyted
ſaint Thomas ſhrine and offred there in the

nexte day rode to Rocheſter. And bycauſe he
had ſo gret a company and cariages he rode
but ſmall iourneys / to eaſe his horſe. And on
the ſondaye he rode to dyner to Dertforde / &amp;
after dyuer to London to be at the feeſt / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

            <p>ON the ſonday nexte after the feeſt of

And ſo came to Smythfelde / where

began / and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynued tyll it was night.
Than knyghtes and ladyes withdrue them
ſelfes: &amp; the quene was lodged beſyde Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les

The erle Walleran of ſaynt Poule had

they laye all the feeſtes and iuſtes duryng.</p>
            <p>ON the nexte day whiche was mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye / 
ye myght haue ſene in dyuers
places of the cytie of London / ſquy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers

Than the quene well accompanyed with la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyes

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey / 
and all were redy to iuſte. Than came
the erle of ſaynt Poule and other knyghtes
of Fraunce / ſuche as wolde iuſte. Than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the iuſtes / euery man payned hym ſelfe
to gette honour. Some were ſtryken down

it was nere nyght. Than euery ꝑſon drewe

at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hour of ſupper / euery man drewe to the

it. The price was gyuen hym by the ladyes
lordes and herauldes / who were ordained to
be iudges. And of the inner partie a knyght
of Englande called ſir Hughe Spenſer / had
the price.</p>
            <p>THe nexte daye Tueſday / there was
iuſtes agayne in the ſame place of
all maner of ſquyers / whiche endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

done the dayes before / and at ſupper they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned
to the byſſhoppes palais / where the
kyng / the quene / and the ladyes were. There
was a goodly and a coſtely ſupper / and after
great daunſynge / contynuynge all nyght.</p>
            <p>The wedniſdaye after dyner they iuſted in
the ſame place / all maner of knightes &amp; ſquy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers
ſuche as wolde iuſte. that was a ſore and
a rude iuſtes / enduryng tyll nyght / and than
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drue: &amp; at the hour of ſupper they reſorted
where they ſupped before. The Thurſdaye
the kyng made a ſupper to all knyghtes and
gentylmen ſtraungers / and the quene to all
ladyes and damoſelles. Than on the friday
the duke of Lancaſtre made a dyner for all
knightes &amp; ſquyers ſtraungers / whiche was
a goodly dyner. And on the Saturdaye the
kyng and all the lordes departed fro Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don
to Wyndſore / and therle of Oſtrenaunt and
the erle of ſaynt Poule / with all other knigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes

acompany the kyng to Wyndſore / euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
rode as it was reaſon to the caſtell of Wynd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſore.
Than there began agayne great feeſtꝭ / 
with dyners and ſuppers gyuen by the king
and ſpecially the kyng dyde great honour to
the erle of Oſtrenaunt his coſyn / whiche erle
was deſyred by the kyng and his vncles that
he wolde be content to take on hym the order
of the garter. The erle aunſwered / howe he
wolde take cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle in that mater. Than he
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayled with the lorde of Gomegines and
with Fierabras of Vertan baſtarde / who in
no wyſe wolde diſcorage nor counſayle hym
to refuce the order of the garter. So he toke
it on hym / wherof the knightes and ſquyers
of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſuche as were there had great mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueyle / 
and murmured ſore therat among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſelfe: ſayeng the erle of Oſtrenaunt ſheweth
well that his courage enclyneth rather to be
Englyſſhe than Frenche / whan he taketh on

hym the order of the garter / and weareth the
kynge of Englandes deuyſe. He ſheweth
well he regardeth nat the houſe of Fraunce / 
nor the houſe of Burgoyne. The tyme wyll

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſydred / he knoweth nat what he hath done
for he was welbeloued with the frenche kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge /

other place to any of them / they euer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

hym without cauſe / for that he had done / 
was nothyng contrary nor hurtfull to the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>alme
of Fraunce / nor to his coſyns nor fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

toke on hym the order of the garter / and his

he made none alyaunce / to do any preiudyce
to the realme of Fraunce. For that he dyde / 
was but for loue and good company / howe

departed. Thus ended this great
feeſt in the cytie of London / and euery man
went to their owne. Than it fortuned / as a

by ſuche as hadde ben in Englande
at the ſayde feeſt / of euery thyng that hadde
been done and ſayd / nothyuge was forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten /

It was ſhewed the kyng playnly / how

howe he hadde the chiefe priſe and honoure

It hadde been better we had gyuen

Alwayes they haue owed better good

Sir / ye haue well deuyſed / lette it be done

that the duke of Burgoyne / whoſe doughter

nothynge content with thoſe tidynges / for al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wayes
he had auaunſed his ſonne of Oſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt /

erle had well ouerſene theſe letters / and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
howe that the Frenche kyng and his

And in the meane ſeaſon they ſente certayne

it ſhulde come thus to paſſe. Wyllyam my

I haue delyuered hym the rule and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce

you what ye ſhall do. Go to my fayre coſyn
the duke of Burgoyn / for it lyeth well in his
power to regarde and to ſette an order in all
thynges demaunded by the Frenche kynge / 
I canne gyue you no better counſayle. With
this anſwere they departed out of Hollande
and came in to Heynault / and there ſhewed

were nothynge content with the frenche

to bargayne with the ſarazyns / &amp; take
their parte / and to betray y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cryſten men. The

to the entent to go to Iheruſalem. Thus they
departed fro the ſiege of Aufryke / and toke
the ſee in the ſyght of the ſarazyns that were
within the towne. Whan they ſawe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture / 
they made gret noyſe with blowyng
of hornes and ſownynge of taburs / and ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
and cryeng / in ſuche wyſe / that the hoſt
of ſarazyns that lay abrode knew therof. than
ye <abbr>ſhuld</abbr> haue ſene the yonge ſarazyns mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te
on their horſes / and came to the place where
the ſiege had layne / to ſe if they coulde haue
founde any thynge there. Agadingor of Oly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferne / 
and Brahadyne of Thunes formeſt.
And there they ſawe howe the chriſten men
were ſo clene departed / that they had lefte no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thynge
behynde that they myght cary. There
the ſarazyns rode vp and downe more than
two houres / to ſe the maner howe the cryſten
men had lodged theym ſelfe at the ſiege / they
greatly prayſed the cryſten mennes ſubtyltie / 
in that they had made ſo many pyttes in the
erthe to haue therby freſſhe water. And whan
they hadde been there a certayne ſpace / and
well regarded the galees and ſhyppes on the
ſee / ſome of theym entred in to the towne of
Aufryke / to ſe their frendes and alyes / and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
departed agayne to their lodgynges / and
made boſt of their voyage / ſayenge howe the
cryſten men durſt abyde there no lengar / and
ſayd howe their puiſſaunce was nothynge to
regarde / and that they wolde neuer more ſette
ſomoche by the frenche men nor by the geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoys / 
as they had done before. and of this they
ſayd trouth / I ſhall tell you howe &amp; wherfore.</p>
            <p>AFter that this ſiege was thus conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued / 
as I was enfourmed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſarazins
waxed proude / for they ſawe well howe the
genouoys had done their full power to hurte
and to anoy them / and they ſawe that this voy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>age
was to their great coſte / and yet had won
but lytell / whiche was of trouthe. And all that
ſeaſon the ſarazyns knewe nothing of the deth
of ſo many cryſten knyghtes and ſquyers as
were ſlayne at the great ſkrymyſſhe / but the
ſame day that the cryſten men departed / they
had knowledge therof / and I ſhall ſhewe you
by what meanes. The ſarazyns founde in the
felde a varlet of the genouoys / lyenge on the
grounde ſore ſycke of the hote feuer / and was
nat able to go to the galees whan his felowes
departed. And of the fyndynge of this varlet / 
the ſarazyns were ryght ioyfull / and brought
him before their lordes / and ſhewed howe they
had founde hym / than a trucheman was ſet to
here his examynacion. In the begynnynge he
wolde ſhewe nothyng / for he reekened himſelfe
but deed / and he deſyred the ſarazyns incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynent
that they wolde put hym to deth. than
the lordes of the hooſt / as Agadingor Doly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferne / 
Brahadyn of Thunes / and dyuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / 
thought if they ſhulde cauſe hym to dye
they ſhulde wyn nothyng therby / yet rather to
ſaue his lyfe / ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wolde ſhewe the trouthe
of that he ſhulde be demaunded. Than it was
ſhewed hym that if he wolde without lyenge
ſhewe the trouth / his lyfe ſhulde be ſaued / and
to be delyuered franke and free / and ſent into
his owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey by the firſt ſhyp that ſhulde
come thence / outher in to the lande of Geneue
or Marcyll / and alſo that he ſhulde haue gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to hym a. C. beſantes of golde. Whan the
varlet who feared dethe herde this promeſſe
he was well comforted / for he knew well what
ſo euer the ſarazyns promyſe by their faythe
ſhulde be truely kepte / and alſo ye knowe well
naturally euery man is lothe to dye. Than he
<pb n="ccxii" facs="tcp:22067:226"/>
ſaid to the truchman. cauſe the lordes to ſwere
on their lawe to vpholde all that ye ſayd / and
than ſhall I aunſwere you to all that I ſhalbe
examyned of / as farre forth as I knowe. The
trucheman ſhewed this to the lordes / and they
made faythfull promeſſe by their fayth to full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyll
their promeſſe. Than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> varlet ſayd. nowe
<abbr>demaund</abbr> what ye wyll / and I ſhall anſwere.
Than firſte he was demaunded of whence he
was. He anſwered and ſayd / he was of Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
Than they demaunded of hym of the
feates of the frenche men that had been at the
ſiege. He named to them dyuers / for he hadde
kepte often tymes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with harauldes / by
whome he had lerned dyuers of their names.
Than they deſyred to knowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occaſion why
they departed ſo ſodaynely fro the ſiege. wher
to he anſwered wyſely and ſayd. As for that I
can nat tell / but by ſuppoſynge / and acordyng
as I haue herde ſpoken in our hoſt / as for me
I was neuer a counſayle with the lordes. but
as the brute went / the frenchmen were in doute
of the genouoys that they ſhulde betray them / 
and the genouoys denyed it and ſayd / they ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
thought it nor neuer wolde / and blamed
the frenchmen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhulde ſo ſlaunder them.
Alſo it was ſayd that parte of the occaſyon of
their departure was bycauſe the wynter drue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nere / 
and they were afrayde of taking of ſuche
domage as they had receyued before. what do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mage
was that quod the lordes. Syrs ꝙ he / 
the ſame daye that ten of our men ſhulde haue
fought with ten of yours / they loſt about a .lx.
knightes and ſquiers of name and armes / the
genouoys ſayd for that cauſe they departed.
They beleued well y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> varlet / of whiche newes
the lordes ſarazyns had great ioye. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
of hym no further / but vphelde to him
all their promeſſes / &amp; ſo he retourned to Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and to Geane / and ſhewed all this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture / 
and what he had ſaid and herde / and
he receyued no blame therof. Than the ſara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zyns
ſayd amonge them ſelfe / they ſhulde nat
nede to care for the frenche men nor for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouoys
of a longe ſeaſon after / and ſaid howe
before the towne of Aufryke they had taken no
profyte / howe be it they ſayde they wolde take
better hede to their portes and hauens and the
ſee coſtes of their Realmes / and ſpecyally to
the ſtraytes of Marroke they ſet ſure watche / 
that the genouoys nor venyſians ſhulde nat
paſſe that wayes in to Englande / nor in to
Flaunders / with their marchaundyſes / with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
payenge of a great trybute / and yet that to
be by greate grace and lycence. Thus the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razyns
aſſembled and alyed them togythers
of dyuers realmes / as of Aufryke / Thunes / 
Bogy / Martoke / Belmaryn / Tremeſſyans / 
&amp; Granade / all agreed togyder to kepe ſtrayt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their portes and paſſages / and to ſette ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees
armed on the ſee to a great nombre / to the
entent to be lordes and maiſters of the ſee. and
all this they dyd for the great hatred that they
had to the frenchmen and genouoys / bycauſe
they had ben at the ſiege before Aufryke. thus
they dyd great trouble to the goers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
on the ſee / ſo that moche yuell and myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefe
grewe therby / for by meanes that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razyns
were thus lordes of the ſee / ſuche mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundyſes
as came fro Da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mas / fro Cayrel
fro Alexaunder / fro Venyce / fro Naples / and
fro Geane / were in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeaſon ſo dere in Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and ſo ſcarce / that many thynges coulde
nat be gotte / nouther for golde no ſyluer / and
ſpecially all ſpycery was wonderfull dere and
gayſon.</p>
            <p>YE haue <abbr>herd</abbr> here before howe the cry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſten
men departed for the ſiege of Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fryke.
They all paſſed the ſee / but all
aryued nat at one porte / for ſome were ſo ſore
tourmented on the ſee / that they retourned in
great daunger / howe be it ſome of theym re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to Geane. Proceſſyons were made in
Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for their good ſpede / for there was no
tydynges herde of them. The lady of Coucy / 
the lady of Sulley / the lady Dolphyn of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergne / 
and other ladyes of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / who had
their huſbandes in this voyage were in great
ſorowe / as longe as the voyage endured. and
whan tydynges came howe they were paſſed
the ſee / they were ryght ioyfull. The duke of
Burbone and the lorde of Coucy retourned
priuely / and lefte behynde them all their cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and trayne / and ſo they came to Parys a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boute
ſaynte Martyns tyde in wynter. The
frenche kynge was ioyouſe of their comynge / 
as it was reaſon / and demaunded of them ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges
of Barbary / and of their voyage. they
ſhewed al that they knewe / and had herde and
ſene. The kynge and the duke of Thourayne
were glad to here them ſpeke. Than the kyng
ſayd / if we can bringe it aboute to make peace
in the churche / and bytwene vs and Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / 
<pb facs="tcp:22067:227"/>
we ſhall gladly make a voyage with an army
royall in to thoſe parties / to exalte the cryſten
fayth / and to confounde the infydels and to ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quyte
the dedes of our predeceſſours / as kyng
Ppilyp and kinge Iohan / for they bothe eche
after other tooke on them the croſſey / to haue
gone to the holy lande / and they had gone thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres had nat fallen in their realme.
In lyke wyſe we wolde gladly make ſuche a
voyage. Thus the Frenche kynge comuned
with theſe lordes / and ſo the day paſſed / and
lytell and lytell men came home fro their voy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>age / 
and the kynge helde hym ſelfe that ſeaſon
moſt comenly at Parys / ſomtyme at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſtell
of Lowre / and a nother tyme in the howſe of
ſaynt Powle / where the quene moſt comenly
laye. So it fell in the ſame ſeaſon aboute the
feeſt of ſaynt Andrewe / and that all knyghtes
and ſquyers were retourned fro their voyage
into Barbary / wherof all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worlde ſpake. than
in the frenche kynges court there was a mocy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
moued for a newe iourney to be made thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And bycauſe that the frenche kynge had
gret affection to dedes of armes / he was coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayled
and exorted therto / and it was ſayde to
hym. Syr ye haue deuocyon and great yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynacion
to go ouer the ſee / to fyght agaynſt
the infydels / and to conquere the holy lande.
That is trewe quod the kynge / my thought
nyght and day is on none other thyng. and as
I was enfourmed / it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <abbr>lord</abbr> of Tremoyle
and ſir Iohan Mercier that had theſe wordes
to the king / for they owed their fauour to pope
Clement beynge at Auignon. and loke what
they two ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng wolde agre to them / for
they were moſt ſpeciall in fauour. Than they
ſayd to the kynge. Syr ye can nat with good
conſcience take on you this voyage / with out
firſt the church be all one. ſyr begyn firſt at the
heed / than your enterpriſe ſhall take good con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluſyon.
Why quod the kynge where wolde ye
haue me to begyn? Syr quod they at this pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent
tyme ye be nat charged with any great bu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyneſſe / 
ye haue treuce with the englyſſhe men
for a longe ſpace. wherfore ſyr if it pleaſe you
this peace durynge / ye myght make a goodly
voyage. and ſyr we can ſe no better nor more
honourable a voyage for you / thanne to go to
Rome with a great puyſſaunce of men of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes / 
and pull downe and dyſtroy that ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paye /

if ye wyll ye maye well accomplyſſhe this

know that if this antepape and his cardynals
knowe ones y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye be mynded to come on them
with an army / they wyll yelde them ſelf / &amp; aſke
mercy. The kynge reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred hym ſelfe a lytell
and ſayd / howe he wolde do as they had deuy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed / 
for ſurely he ſaid he was moche bounde to

There was two great reaſons that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

was / that the realme of Fraunce therby was

that hadde done moche hurte in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aime / 
and therby the countreys better aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
than they were before. The ſeconde rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was to ayde his ſuſter / for he had great
pytie that ſhe and her huſbande ſhulde leſe
their herytage / wherby they ſhulde lyue and
maynteyne their eſtate / and for theſe conſyde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racions
he toke on hym this enterprice. The
capitayns of the companyons ſayde one to a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother.
Lette vs ryde forthe merily agaynſt
theſe lombardꝭ / we haue a good quarell and
a inſte tytell / and we haue a good capitayne / 
wherby our warre ſhalbe moche the better.
And alſo we ſhall go in to the beſt countrey
of all the worlde / for Lombardy receyueth
fro all coſtes the fatneſſe of the worlde: and
the e lombardes be naturally euer riche and
cowardes: We ſhall attayne agaynſt theym
moche profyte: There is none of vs that be
capitayns / but that ſhall retourne ſo ryche / 
that we ſhall neuer nede to make warre more

            <p>In the ſame ſeaſon the good abue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turous

thought that if he might get this Englyſſhe
knyght to take parte with hym / he ſhulde ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
a great treaſure of hym / bycauſe of his
wyſedome &amp; valyauntneſſe. The erle wrote
to hym / ſignyfieng hym all the hole mater of

Whiche letter was ſente by a diſcrete perſon
to ſir Iohan Hacton beyng in the marcheſſe

and aunſwered and ſayde. That his owne
warre ones atchyued / he wolde do nothyng

The daye was fayre and clere and
the erle of Armynake who was yong and lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſty / 
after he had herde maſſe in his pauilyon /

and ſet on the acmynagoys / who valyauntly
defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded themſelfe / for alwayes lytell and lytell
ſocour came to them / there was many a feate
of armes done. It was on ſaynte Chriſtofers
daye / and the daye was ſo hoote that ſuche as
were in their harnes / thought verily they had
ben in a furnes / the wether was ſo faynt with
out wynde / ſo that the luſtyeſt they had moche
a do to do any feate of armes. The partye of
Myllayne were thre agaynſt one. The duſte
and the powder was ſo great that they coulde
ſcante ſe one a nother / and ſpecially they of the
erle of Armynakes parte. There fell to the erle
a great aduenture / he was ſo oppreſſed with
heate / that he was ſo feble that he coulde ſcant
helpe him ſelfe / ſo that he drewe aparte out on
the one ſyde of the felde and no man with him / 
and there founde a lytell ryuer / whan he felte
the ayre of the water he thought he was in pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>radyſe /

the ſtrength of his body and ſpeche / and his

After a knight of the duke of Millayns fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
the erle of Armynake. Whan he ſawe hym he
had meruayle what he was / he parceyued wel
he was a knyght &amp; a man of honour. Than the
knight ſaid. Sir who be you? yelde you ye are
my pryſoner. The erle vnderſtode hym nat / 
nor he coulde nat ſpeke / but he helde vp his

knyght wolde haue hadde hym to ryſe / but he
coulde nat. The knyght taryed ſtyll with him
whyle other dyd fyght / in the whiche batayle
many a feate of armes was done.</p>
            <p>WHan ſyr Iaques de la Bierne who
was a ſage knyght / ſawe howe the
iourney was good for his party / and
howe that a gret nombre of his enemyes were
taken and ſlayne / and alſo ſawe well that his
owne men world <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery / and that his enemyes
began to multyply with freſſhe men / than he
reculed towarde the cytie ſkrymyſſhynge and
defendynge. The knyght that had taken the
erle of Armynake / thought nat to leaue hym
behynde / for he thought ſurely he was ſome
man of honoure / and deſyred his company to
ayde hym / to beare his priſoner in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne
promyſynge them to haue parte of his raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.
They dyd ſo / and with moche payne
brought him in to the cyte / and was vnarmed
and layde in a bedde. Than ſyr Iaques de la
Bierne entred in to the cytie and toke his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge
and vnarmed hym / and refreſſhed him
and his company. And whan the erle of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynacke
was myſt in the hooſt without / they
were ſore dyſmayed / and wyſt nat what to ſay
nor do / and ſome came to the place where the
batayle had ben to ſeke for hym / and returned
agayne clene dyſcomfyted. The knyght that
had taken the erle of Armynake had great de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyre
to know what man his priſoner was / and
came to another ſquyer that was in lykewyſe
taken priſoner a gaſcon / deſyringe his may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to ſuffre hym to go with hym to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge.
ſo they went togyder. The lombarde
knyght led the ſquyer of Fraunce in to a cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre / 
and brought hym to the bedde where the
erle of Armynake lay ſore complaynyng / and
cauſed torches to be lyghted vp / and than ſaid
to the french ſquyer. Sir / knowe you nat this
man? The ſquyer regarded hym well &amp; ſayd / 
I knowe hym well for I ought ſo to do / it is
our capitayne the erle of Armynake. With the
whiche wordes the lombarde was ioyfull / but
the Erle was ſo ſycke that he vnderſtode no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
that was ſayd to hym. Than his may<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter
ſayd / go we hence let hym reſt. Thus they
left him / and the ſame nyght he dyed / and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this tranſitory lyfe. The next day whan it
was knowen that the erle of Armynake was
deed in Alexaunder in his bedde / ſyr Iaques
of Bierne wolde nat that his dethe ſhulde be
vnknowen / but cauſed it to be publyſſhed in
the hooſt / by ſuche priſoners as he had / to ſe
what his enemyes wolde do. They of the hoſt
were ſore dyſcomfyted as they well ſhewed / 
for as than they had no capitayne to drawe vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to / 
for they were but companyons gadred of
all partes. Than they ſayd / let vs returne and
ſaue our ſelfe / for we haue loſt our tyme. Anon
it was knowen in the Cytie / howe the army<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois
were diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fyted / and had no capytayne.
than they armed them / and iſſued out a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe
and a foote / and ſet on the hooſt cryenge
Pauy for the lorde of Myllayne. There they
were taken and ſlayne without defence. The
conqueſt and botye was great with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyons
<pb facs="tcp:22067:232"/>
that were come thyder with ſyr Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
of Bierne the Armynage is yelded them
ſelfe without defence and caſt away armure
and ſledde / and were chaſed lyke beaſtes. Lo
what a harde aduenture therle of Armynake
and his company bad / and where as his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente
was to do well / it tourned hym to great
yuell. If he had lyued fyue dayes lenger / ſyr
Iohan Acton had come to hym with fyue hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred
ſpeares / and a thouſande brigandyns a
foote / wherby he myght haue done many fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of armes / and all loſt by harde aduenture.</p>
            <p>WHan the duke of Myllayn knewe the
trouth that his enemyes were ſlayne
and taken / and ſpecyally the erle of
Armynake ſlayne / he was ioyfull therof / and
loued ſyr Iaques de Bierne the better in his
herte / and made hym ſoueraygne ouer all his
chyualry / and made him chefe of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle.
The duke of Myllayne to auoyde his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of his enemyes / gaue to euery pryſoner
that was a gentylman a horſe / and to euery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man a florayne and quyted them clene of
their raunſomes / but at their departynge he
cauſed them to ſwere that they ſhulde neuer af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
arme them agaynſt hym. Thus theſe com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panions
departed out of Lombardy and Pie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mount / 
and entred in to Sauoy and in to the
dolpheny / and had ſuche pouertie that it was
marueyle for as they paſſed euery towne was
cloſed agaynſt theym. Anone euery man had
ſpent his florayn / ſome had pytie of them and
dyd gyue them almes for charite / and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>buked
and mocked them / ſayenge. Go your
wayes ſeke out your erle of Armynake / who
is drinkynge at a well before Alexaundre. yet
they were in more myſchiefe whan they came
to the ryuer of Rone they had thought lightly
to haue paſſed ouer in to the realme of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
but they dyd nat for the frenche kynge hadde
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded all the paſſages to be cloſed and
kept agaynſt them / wherby they fell in great
daunger and pouertie. After that they coulde
neuer aſſemble togyther agayne. Thus the
yonge erle of Armynakes army brake a ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
&amp; his ſuſter abode ſtyll in as yuell caſe as
ſhe was in before. Than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Myllayne
ſent for a byſſhop of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey / and for ſuche
as were moſt next to the erle of Armynake / as
had ben there with hym at that iourney / and
the duke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that therles body ſhulde
be baumed / and ſente to his brother ſyr Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde / 
who was ryght ſorowfull of thoſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynges / 
and good cauſe why / but there was
no remedy. Than the erle of Armynake was
buryed in the cathedrall churche of Rodays / 
and there he lyeth.</p>
            <p>IT ought to be knowen as it hath ben
contayned here before in this hiſtory / 
how ſyr Thomas Percy was ſent by
kyng Rycharde of Englande in to the realme

to ſuſtayne that opinyon / but they diſſymuled
the mater couertely / bycauſe they ſawe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

to haue warre / ſuche as had ſuſteyned there
eſtates by reaſon of the warre. Conſydre well

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this ſaid ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there
was a knyght of Fraunce
of the countrey of Aniou / a
gentle knight and of noble
extraction / called ſyr Pyer
of Craon / marucylouſly
well beloued / and ſpecially
with the duke of Thourayne / for aboute the
duke no thynge was doone but by hym. Alſo
this knyght helde a gret aſtate about the duke
of Aniou / who was called kynge of Naples / 
Cicyll / &amp; Iheruſalem / and alſo he was ryche.
Aſclaunder was brought vp on hym through
the realme of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / howe he had robbed the
yonge kynge of Cycyll duke of Aniou / for the
whiche brute the ſayd ſir Peter abſented him
ſelfe fro the yonge kynge and fro his mather / 
who had ben wyfe to the olde duke of Aniou / 
howe be it he delte ſo that he was welbeloued
with the frenche kynge / and with his brother
the duke of Thourayne. Alſo the ſame ſeaſon
ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon / as thanne conſtable of
Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / was greatly in fauour with the kyng
and with the duke of Thourayne / whiche fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
he had get by reaſon of the good ſeruyce
that he had done in armes / as well in Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
as els where / in the kynges dayes and in his
fathers dayes kinge Charles / and ſir Olyer
of Clyſſons doughter had wedded Iohan of
Bretayne / brother germayne to the quene of
Iheruſalem / and this ſyr Olyuer Clyſſon by
reaſon of the alyaunce that he had by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage
of Iohan of Bretayne / was greatly in
the duke of Bretayns indignacion / in ſomoch
that the duke helde him for his mortall enemy / 
and Iohan of Bretayne in lykewyſe / and the
duke of Bretayne repented hym that he had
nat ſlaine ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon whan he had
hym in priſone in his caſtell of Ermyn. This
ſyr Peter of Craon was in ſuche fauour with
the duke of Bretaygne that he myght do with
him what he lyſt / he was his coſyn. and whyle
he was in fauour with the frenche kynge and
with the duke of Thourayn / he wolde gladly
haue brought out of the kynges fauoure ſyr
Olyuer of Clyſſon the conſtable / if he coulde
haue brought it aboute.</p>
            <p>THus the enuyous whiche couertely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
hath reygned in Fraunce / diſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muling
their maters tyll they come to an yuell
concluſion. The conſtable of Fraunce had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ben ſo true in all his dedes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crowne
of Fraunce / that euery manne loued hym / ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the duke of Burgoyn / who loued him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng.
the hatred came by the duches of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne / 
who was a lady of hygh corage / for ſhe
coulde nat loue the Conſtable / for the duke of
Bretayne was nere of <abbr>blod</abbr> to her / and all that
her father the erle of Flaunders loued ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued / 
and ſuche as he hated ſhe dyd the ſame / 
ſhe was of that condycion. This ſyr Peter of
Craon whyle he was in the frenche court / and
great with the duke of Thourayne / he wrote
often tymes to the duke of Bretayne ſecretly
euery thynge that he knewe / &amp; the duke wrote
agayne to hym. Theffecte of their writynges
I coude nat knowe / how be it I Iohan Froy
ſart auctor of this hyſtory / on a tyme whan I
was at Parys / on a night whan a great myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefe
was lykely to haue fallen vpon ſir Oly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Clyſſon conſtable of Fraunce / by a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous
enterpriſe of ſyr Peter of Craon / as
I ſhall herafter more playnly declare / whan
tyme ſhall requyre. And bycauſe I ſawe the
mater darke and obſcure / &amp; lykely to be great
trouble and daunger / I dyd all the payne I
coulde to knowe the grounde and occaſyon of
the mater / why ſyr Peter of Craon was ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynly
banyſſhed fro the frenche kynges loue
and the duke of Thourayns. Suche ſerche I
<pb facs="tcp:22067:233"/>
made and ſuche enquery of them that knewe
the mater / that ſome of them enfourmed me of
the trouth as the fame &amp; renome ran. Fyrſt the
duke of Thourayn was dyſpleaſed with this
ſyr Peter of Craon through his owne faute / 
for he dyſcloſed the ſecretneſſe that was by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
the duke of Thourayne and another
lady. If he dyd ſo he dyd yuell.</p>
            <p>THe duke of Thourayne as than had
ſuche fauour to ſyr Peter of Craon / 
that he toke hym as his companyon / 
and ware euer lyke apparell / and had hym al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
with hym where ſo euer he wente / and
ſhewed hym all his ſecretes. This Duke of
Thourayn as than was yonge and amorous / 
and gladly wolde company with ladyes and
damoſels / and ſporte hym amonge them / and
ſpecially as it was ſhewed me / he loued entier<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
a fayre lady of Paris / yonge and freſſh. His
loue and ſecretes were knowen in ſuche wyſe
that it turned to great dyſpleſure to the duke / 
and he wyſte nat whome to blame but ſyr Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Craon / for the duke had ſhewed hym all
his ſecretes in that mater / and had taken hym
in his company / whan he wolde ſecretly ſpeke
with the ſaid yonge lady. The duke on a tyme
promyſed the ſayd lady a thouſande crownes
of golde / ſo that he myght haue his pleaſure of
her. But the lady as than refuſed it and ſayd / 
howe ſhe loued hym nat for his golde nor ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer / 
but pure loue enclyned her to beare hym
her good wyll / but as for golde or ſyluer ſhe
wolde nat ſell her honoure. All theſe wordes
and promeſſes were knowen by the duches of
Thourayne / who incontynent ſent for the ſaid
yonge lady in to her chambre. Than ſhe called
her by her name / and in gret diſpleaſure ſayd.
Wylte thou do me wronge with my lorde my
<abbr>huſband?</abbr> The yonge lady was abaſſhed / and
all wepynge ſayd. Nay madame by the grace
of god / I neuer dyd thynke it nor neuer wyll.
than the ducheſſe ſayd. Thus it is / Iame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed
that my lorde my huſbande loueth
you / and you him / and the mater ſo farre gone
bytwene you / that in ſuche a place and at ſuche
a tyme he promyſed you a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de crownes
of golde to haue his pleaſer of you / howe be it
ye dyd refuſe it as than / wherin ye dyd wyſely
and therfore as at this tyme I ꝑdon you / but
I charge you as derely as ye loue your lyfe / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ye commune nor talke no more with hym / but
ſuffre hym to paſſe / &amp; herkyn nat to his comu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge.
Than whan the yonge lady ſawe her
ſelfe accuſed of trouth ſhe anſwered and ſayd.
Madame / I ſhall delyuer me fro him as ſone
as I can / and ſhall ſo / deale that ye ſhall haue
no cauſe of dyſpleaſure in this mater. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the ducheſſe gaue her leaue to departe / 
and ſo ſhe returned to her lodgyng. The duke
of Thourayne who knewe nothynge of this
mater / and as he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> entierly loued this yonge
lady / fortuned on a day to come where as ſhe
was. Whanne ſhe ſawe hym ſhe eſchewed his
company / and made hym no maner of ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blant
of loue / but dyd clene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that ſhe
had vſed before / for ſhe durſt nat / and alſo ſhe
had ſworne &amp; promyſed / to the duches. Whan
the duke ſawe her countenaunce he was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyue / 
and thought he wolde knowe why ſhe
delte ſo ſtraungely / and demaunded of her the
cauſe of her ſtraungnes. The yonge lady all
wepynge ſayd. Syrye haue bewrayed your
loue / and the ſecrete promeſſe an offre that ye
made me / to my lady your wyfe / or els ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / 
remembre you wel to whom ye haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
your ſecretneſſe / for ſyr I was in great
daunger by my lady your wyfe / and by none
other / and I haue ſworne and promyſed her
that after this tyme I wyll neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany nor
talke with you / wherby ſhe ſhulde haue any
ielouſy. whan the duke harde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were ſore
wordes to him / and greatly to his diſpleaſure
and ſaid. Ah my ſayre lady / I ſwere to you by
my faythe / that rather than this mater ſhulde
haue ben ſhewed to my wyfe / that I had loſte
a hundred thouſande frankes / ſythe ye haue
ſworne / kepe your promeſſe / for what ſo euer
it coſte me I wyll knowe the trouth who hath
bewrayed our ſecretes.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus the Duke departed fro the
yonge lady / and made no ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blant
as than / but pacyentely ſuffred / 
howe be it he thought the more.
and at nyght came to his wyfe to
ſupper / &amp; ſhewed her more token of loue than
euer he dyd befor / and he dyd ſomoche with
fayre wordes that the ducheſſe ſhewed him all
the matter / and howe that ſhe knewe it by ſyr
Peter of Craon. than the duke ſpake no more

and ſaid. Ah fayre brother. what is the mater?
it ſemeth ye be troubled. Syr quod he good

you ſhewe me. The duke who wolde hyde no

Peter of Craon / and ſayd. Syr by the faythe
that Iowe to god and to you / if it were nat for

well ynough quod the kynge / he ſhall be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by our counſayle to auoyde our houſe and
ſeruyce / and in lykewyſe cauſe him to auoyde
your houſe and company. I am well content
with this ꝙ the duke. The ſame day the lorde
de la Ryuer and ſir Iohan Mercyer ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſyr Peter of Craon on the kynges behalfe / 
that he ſhulde auoyde the kynges courte and

Whan ſyr Peter of Craon ſawe this he

trewe it was / he deſyred to come in to the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

that nother the kynge nor the duke wolde nat

he apparelled hym ſelfe / and departed
out of Parys in great diſpleaſure in his hert / 
and ſo rode into Aniou to a caſtell of his owne
called Sable / and taryed there a ſeaſon fore
troubled in his mynde. He ſawe well he was
chaſed out of the frenche courte / and out of the
houſe of Thourayn / and alſo out of the houſe
of the quene of Naples and Iheruſalem. than
whan he parceyued theſe thre howſes cloſed

his coſyn / and to ſhewe hym all his ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uentures.
ſo he dyd / and rode in to Bretayne / 
and founde the duke at Wannes / who made
hym good chere / and knewe ſomwhat before

hym all the caſe. Whan the duke of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taygne
had well herde all the mater / he ſayde.
Fayre coſyn recomforte your ſelfe / all this is
ſurely brought aboute by ſyr Olyuer of Clyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>THis rote and foundacyon of hatred
multyplyed greatly after / as ye ſhall
here in this hyſtory. Syr Peter of
Craon taryed ſo longe with the duke of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taygne / 
that he forgate Fraunce / for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon and the kynges
counſayle were agaynſte hym / and alſo they
were nat contente with the duke of Bretayne
in that he kepte ſir Peter Craon in his houſe.
As for the duke of Bretaygne cared nat great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly / 
neyther for the good wyll nor yuell wyll of
the Frenche kynge / he prouyded ſuffyciently
for his cyties / townes / and caſtelles / in ſuche
wyſe / that he loued as well warre as peace.
And all that euer he dyd was well knowen in
Fraunce / and with the kinges counſayle. and
ſuche as were nexte aboute the kynge reputed
the duke of Bretaygne prowde and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous / 
and thretened him greatly / but the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
dyde ſette lytell therby / and ſayde / that he
wolde make warre agaynſt the erle of Poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieur
in a iuſte quarell / for the erle of Poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyeur
our coſyn / wryteth and nameth hym
ſelfe Iohan of Bretayne / as though he were
herytour of this countrey. I wyll he be called
Iohan / for that is his name and erle of Poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieur / 
and I wyll he put out of his armes the
Ermyns / and write himſelfe Iohan of Bloys
or of Chatellon / and none other. and if he wyll
nat do thus I ſhall cauſe him to do it / and take
fro hym his lande / for he holdeth it by faythe
and homage of vs / as for the herytage of Bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taygne
he hathe nothynge to do therwith / ſo
that it ſhulde returne to him / for I haue bothe
ſonnes and doughters that ſhall be myne hey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res.
Let hym purchaſe hym landes in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place / for as of this he hath fayled. Thus
often tymes the duke of Bretayne wolde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſe
with ſir Peter of Craon / who wolde nat
replye agaynſt his pleaſure / but rather dyd
further it / and all for the yuell wyll that
he bare to the conſtable ſyr Oly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

of the countie of Foiz. and whan ſyr Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

if I were ſauynge your correction / I wolde
counſayle the kyng that he ſhulde take agayn
his money / and ſomwhat more (trewe it is he
hath lente money on the herytage of Foize / to
be reyſed after the dethe of the erle) yet let the
kynge leaue the ryght of the enherytaunce to
the nexte enherytoure of the blode / this ſhall
be for the kynges profyte / honour / and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon / 
and in this that I ſaye / I ſhall laye dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
reaſons / if ye wyll here it. There is one
thynge whiche is clere / the erle of Foiz layde
his lande to pledge by fraude / for as for golde
and ſyluer he had ynough / for that he dyd was
for nothynge but to dyſheryte the Vicount of
Chaſtellon wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfully / bycauſe he hated hym
without cauſe. Alſo as touchyng the kynges
profyte / I enſure you the kepyng of the lande
of Foize ſhulde coſte the kynge more than the
rentes or reuenues cometh vnto. And thyrdly
the kyng ſhall leſe therby the homage and ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyce
of ſuche a man as is able to do him good
ſeruyce / this ought to be well regarded. alſo it
ſhulde be a great charge to the kynges conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

howe be it all that euer he dyd was knowen in
Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / and many ſpake largely againſt him.
He knewe well that certrayne lordes of Fraunce
were nat contente with hym / but he dyd ſet ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
therby / but ſo paſſed on his tyme. He had
great affyaunce in his coſyne the ducheſſe of
Burgoyne / as it was reaſon / for he had of her
a ſpecyall ſupporte and ayde / for the lady by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of lygnage loued hym / and bycauſe that
the erle of Flaunders her father / who was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyn
germayne to the duke had alwayes loued
and comforted hym in all his trybulacyons.
This lady of Burgoyne was a good lady / ſo
that the duke her huſbande wolde nat gladly
diſpleaſe her / and good cauſe why / for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke
by her helde great herytages / and had by her
fayre chyldren. all the realme of Fraunce was
bounde to loue her / and ſhe had nat ben / great
dyſcenſions had moued bytwene the parties / 
for natwithſtandynge that the duke of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
had ben at Paris with the french kyng / 
and made to hym homage / yet I can nat well
ſay if it was with good herte or no / for as ſone
as the duke was retourned in to Bretaygne / 
there apered in hym but ſmall amendemente / 
he had ſworne obeyſaunce and to be obedyent
to the pope at Auignon / but he was nat / for ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
he diſpyſed hym in his wordes. Nor alſo
he wolde ſuffre no man to be promoted in his

They reken me very yonge and ignorante / to

that if all my men of the duchy of Bretaygne /

made often tymes to the kynge / and ſuche as

is ryght preſumptuous and proude / ſythe he
wyll be brought to no reaſon / and if he ſhulde

greatly enfeble the nobleneſſe of this realme /

            <p>THus there was ſente in to Bretayne
to the duke the erle of Eſtampes and
mayſter Iue of Noyent. They toke
great payne and traueyle to moue the duke
to mete with the frenche kynge at Towrs. they
ſpake ſo fayre with freſſhe coloured wordes / 
armed with reaſon / that the duke agreed to
go to Towrs / but further he ſayd in no wyſe
he wolde go / and alſo that he ſhulde nat ſe his
enemy ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon in no wyſe. All
this was acorded &amp; agreed / or he wolde come
to Towrs. Theſe ambaſſadours retourned
in to Fraunce and ſhewed the kynge and his
counſayle howe they had ſpedde. They were
contente therwith / ſythe they coulde brynge
hym to none other purpoſe. The kynge and
his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle made them redy to go to Towrs
and to tary there a two or thre monethes / for
they thought their treatie with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne
ſhulde nat ſone be acompliſſhed. Thus
the frenche kinge / the duke of Thourayne his
brother / the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne / 
and Iohan of Burgoyne his ſonne / the duke
of Burbon / the lorde Coucy / the erle of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che /

Alſo thyder came the conſtable of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and Iohan of Bretayne his ſonne in lawe / 
and their counſayles / for they hadde maters
there to do. And a fyftene dayes after / thyder
came the duke of Bretayne. or he came it was
ſayd he wolde nat come / for he had thre tymes
ſent to excuſe hym ſelfe / ſayenge he was ſpeke
and coude nat ryde / how be it finally he came / 
and was lodged at his eaſe. There was ſyr
Roger of Spaygne to haue ben aunſwered / 
but the kynge and the counſayle had ſomoche
to do with the duke of Bretayns maters / that
they coulde entende to nothyng els. This ſyr
Roger was there more than two monethes or
he coulde be aunſwered / but daily he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhulde be herde / but it was longe

ſyr Iohan Clapam / one of the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
counſayle and of his chaumbre / and Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde
Choall clerke and doctour of lawe / to
ſpeke with the Frenche kynge and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle / 
for the ſame matter that ſyr Thomas
Percy and the lorde Clyfforde had ben at Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rys
for with the kynge. Whan the englyſſhe
men were come to Towrs / all other treaties
were cloſed vp and entended to their delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce.
It was ſhewed me that they brought
letters of credence to the kynge and to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
of Berrey &amp; Burgoyne. they were herde.
Their credence was / that the kynge of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande
and his Vncles wolde knowe if the
frenche kynge and his counſayle were in wyll
and mynde to kepe their metyng at Amyence
to treate for a peace to be had bytwene the two
kynges / their alyes and confederates. The
frenche fynge (who as he ſhewed / deſyred no
thynge ſo moche as peace / and anſwered and
ſaid / that he was redy to accomplyſſhe all pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meſſes / 
ſayenge that as ſoone as he had dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
the duke of Bretayne and were depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               </gap>s / tyll he were come to Amyence / and there to
abyde for the englyſſhe ambaſſadours / and
there to make them as good chere as he coude.
Here with the englyſſhe ambaſſadours were
well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent / and were a fyue dayes at Towrs
with the kynge / and than tooke their leaue of
the kynge and of the other lordes. The kynge
gaue them great gyftes and their coſtes there
payed for / and ſo departed. and all that ſeaſon
they ſawe nat the duke of Bretayne nor ſpake
nat with hym / for the duke welde nat / leſte the
frenche men ſhulde haue any ſuſpecte in hym.
Thus the englyſſhmen retourned to Calays
and ſo to Douer / and to London and founde
the kynge and his counſayle at Weſtmynſter / 
and there ſhewed what they had done / herde / 
and ſene. The anſwere that they brought plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
well the kynge and his counſayle / and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
for their iourney to go to Amyence.</p>
            <p>¶Nowe let vs ſom what ſpeke of the meſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that were ſente to the frenche kynge / fro
the Vycount of Chaſtellon / out of Foize and
Bierne.</p>
            <p>SIr Roger of Spayne &amp; ſir Eſpaygne
du Lyon / who were ſent in to Fraunce
fro the Vicounte of Chaſtellen / they toke on
theym great payne and traueyle to purſewe
their cauſe / for certayne clerkes and knightes
of the kinges counſayle / aduyſed the kynge to
take the countie of Foiz / and to attrybute it to
the crowne of Fraunce / ſythe they of the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey
wolde agree therto. The kynge enclyned
well therto / but the duke of Burgoyne who
was ſage and ymagynatyue wolde nat agree
therto / but ſayd alwayes. Let the kynge take
agayn his money / and ſomwhat more. Howe
be it as it was ſhewed me the duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne
coulde nat be herde. But the duke of
Berrey toke the buſyneſſe him / by meanes
as I ſhall ſhewe you. ye haue herde here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what fell bytwene hym and the olde Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcon
erle of Foize / whan the duke ſente in to
Bierne to the erle ſuche notable perſones / as
was the erle of Sanxete / the vicount Daſſey
the lorde de la Ryuer / and ſyr Wyllm<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyle / 
to treate for the maryage of the lady
Iahan of Boloyne / whome the erle of Foize
had in kepinge / and at that tyme the erle was
well content with the maryage that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of
Berrey ſhulde haue her / ſo that he wolde pay
thyrty thouſande frankes for the kepyng and
bringynge vp of the lady / and the duke payed
the ſaid ſome / and ſo had the lady to his wyfe.
The duke of Berrey remembred the mater
than / and ſente for ſyr Roger of Spayne and
for ſyr Eſpayne du Lyon / to come ſpeke with
hym in his chambre / and ſo ſecretly he ſayde
to them. Syrs if ye wyll come to a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſyon
in your ſute. ye ſhall attayne therto by
my meanes / but fyrſt I wyll haue agayne the
thyrty thouſande frankes / whiche I payed to
the olde erle of Foiz whan I had my wyfe. I
haue alwayes ymagyned that if I myght o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
lyue the erle of Foiz to haue the money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.
Whan theſe two knyghtes herde the
duke ſay ſo / they regarded eche other &amp; ſpake
neuer a worde. Than the duke ſayd agayne.
Syrs to ſay trouthe I haue taken your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
fro you / ſpeke togyther and aduyſe you
well / without this treatie ye ſhall nat attayne
to your purpoſe / for my brother of Burgoyne
wyll do as I wyll haue hym / he hath the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernaunce
of the countrey of Picardy / and I
of Languedocke / agaynſte my wyll no man
wyll ſpeke. The Vycount of Chaſtellon ſhall
fynde good ynough / for the erle that is deed
had more rycheſſe than the kynge hath in his
treaſour. Than ſyr Roger of Spayne ſayde.
ſir though we wolde agre to your demaunde / 
yet we haue nat here with vs the treaſure to
contente you withall. Ah ſyr Roger quod the
duke / that ſhall nat let nor hyndre the mater / 
and ye promyſe the dette on your faythe and

a greater mater than that is. Syr quod the
knyght I thanke you / we ſhall ſheke togyder
and to more we gyue you an anſwere. It plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth
me well quod the duke. They departed
fro the duke and went to their lodgynge / and
toke counſayle togyther whether they ſhulde
retourne agayne home without agrement or
els acorde to the dukes demaunde / ſo that the
heritage might clerely remayne &amp; abyde with
the Vycount of Chaſtellon. The nexte daye
they retourned to the duke and offered hym
all his demaunde / and ſo there ſyr Roger of
Spayne and ſyr Eſpaygne du Lyon became
dettours to the duke of Berrey for .xxx. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
frankes / on the condicion that he ſhulde
be meane that the kynge ſhulde take agayne

After that day the duke of Berrey (who deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p>THus the treatie bytwene the kynge

the kynge began to treate the Erle to ſell the

The kynge and the duke of Burbone ſpake

than to be poore. Sayeng howe ſhe was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely
to ouerlyue her huſbade. Therfore they
deſyred her to counſayle her huſbande to ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
this marchaundyſe. The counteſſe / who
was a couytous lady: And for loue to haue
the floreyns / ſhe enclyned to their deſyres / 
and ſhe dyd ſo moche with the helpe of other
as the ayde of a varlet of the Erles chambre
called Sohier borne at Malygnes / ſonne to

the erle had gyuen hym in fees and herytagꝭ
more than fyue hundred frankes by yere. Be

This Sohier had nother wytte nor reaſon /

all was but loſte. This Sohier coulde nor

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſſe / 
who was agreed therto by couitouſnes
of the florens. He rowned ſo in his maiſters
eare / that the Erle wente from his promyſe
that he had made to his bayly. And to there
the reuercion of the countie of Bloyes after
his diſceaſe was ſolde / for the ſomme of two
hundred thouſande frankes / and the duke of
Thouraygne to delyuer to the lady of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyes

he ſhulde haue made another ſale of all
his landes in Heynaulte: And the Duke of
Thourayne to haue payde for that two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſande frankes. Howe be it therin
the erle of Bloys reſerued to knowe the erle
of Heynaltes pleaſure therin / who was his
naturall lorde / to whom he owed faythe and
homage for thoſe landes. Howe be it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kyng
and the duke of Thourayn toke that charge
on them / and to diſcharge the erle / what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſhulde fall after. Thus or they departed
they bounde the erle by promyſe and by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges
ſealed / as they might well and eaſely
do / for he had there none of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle ſaue

It ought to be knowen / that Iohan duke of

was the harder to driue. yet the kynge &amp; the

alſo they offred to paye in thre yere after / the

howe the warre had endured ouer longe /

to do his deuoyre in that behalfe. Thus
they toke leaue eche of other.</p>
            <p>THis counſayle at Amyence endured
a fyftene dayes / than the Englyſſhe
men departed / and had with them in
writyng the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of their treatie / to ſhewe

Than the ducheſſe of Irelande departed fro
Amye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and toke leaue of her father the lorde
of Coucy / and retourned with the englyſſhe
lordes. And fro that tyme that they departed
fro Calais tyll they came thyder agayne / they
ſpent nothyng without they lyſt / for the french
kynge made euery thynge to be payed / bothe
for them ſelfe and for their horſes. The duke
of Burgoyne than retourned into Archoys to
the cytie of Arras / and there he founde the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe

with the kynge and the kinge purpoſed
to go to Beamoys &amp; to Gyſors to ſporte hym

conueyed them to Calays / and than toke their

the kyng ſawe them he had great comunynge

               </gap>ate of the parlyamente of
Amyence. The kynge was well content with
that his vncles had done / but than the duke of
Gloceſtre / who was alwayes harde agaynſt
the treatie of peace ſayd / howe there coulde no
good concluſyon be taken in this treatye tyll
the mater were brought to Weſtmynſter to a
generall counſayle of all the thre aſtates of the

none otherwyſe. The duke of Gloceſters wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
were well herde / no manne wolde ſaye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
hym / for he was greatly in the loue of
the realme. Than it was ſhewed to the knigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
of Fraunce that they muſte go with them
to London / otherwyſe they coulde haue none
anſwere. The two knightes obeyed as it was
reaſon. Than the kynge toke his way and the
lordes with him to London. Whan the kynge
came to Darfforde / he tooke his waye to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham / 
and refreſſhed him there with the quene
and than came to Shene / and wente agaynſt
ſaynte Georges feeſt to Wyndſore / and there
the knyghtes of Fraunce were anſwered. but
or I ſhewe you their aunſwereꝭ I wyll ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſpeke of the frenche kynge.</p>
            <p>AFter that this aſſemble and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle
had been at Amyence / the Frenche
kynge for lacke of good gydyng fell
ſycke of the feuer / wherfore he was counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to chaunge the ayre. So he was layde in
a lytter and caryed to Beamoys / and there ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryed
in the byſſhops palays tyll he was hole
and recouered / his brother the duke of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne
with him / &amp; his vncles the dukes of Ber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rey
and Burbone / there he helde his Eaſter.
And after whan the kynge was ſtronge and
myght well ryde / he rode to Gyſors / the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryng
in to Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy / to haue there the ſporte
of huntynge / for theraboute were many fayre
wodes. The kyng beynge there ſir Bernarde
of Armynake / who was brother to Iohan of
Armynake came to the kynge in good array / 
and the Dolphyn of Auuergne in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny / 
whome he founde at Parys in his waye.
There the erle of Armynake and the Erle of
Rodays made their reliefe and homage to the
kynge / acordinge to the cuſtome as other lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of Fraunce made their relyefe / for ſuche
landes as they helde in fee of the kynge. And
whan euery thyng was writen and regeſtred / 
they toke their leaue and retourned to Paris
togyther / and fro thence to their countreys / to
Auuergne and to Languedoc. And about the
feeſt of Aſcenſyon tyde the frenche kynge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned
to Parys in good helthe / and lodged
at his howſe of ſaynte Poll / the whiche was
ordeyned for hym / and thyder was come the
frenche quene and the duches of Thourayne.</p>
            <p>NOwe let vs ſpeke of ſyr Iohan of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
Morante / and of ſyr Taupyn of

for an anſwere of the kyng and his counſayle.
They were at Wyndeſore at ſaynte Georges
feeſt / where was the kynge / his vncles / and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great lordes of Englande. There theſe
lordes counſayled togyther on ſuche promyſe
as they had made to the frenche kyng and his
counſayle at Amyence / and determyned to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyuer
the two Frenche knyghtes / that dayly
called on them for an aunſwere. Than theſe
knyghtes were ſente for on a day / and it was
ſayde to them thus. Syrs be contente / for all
thinges conſydred ye canne haue of vs no full
anſwere at this tyme / for it wolde be harde as
nowe to aſſemble togyther the thre eſtates of
the realme / vntyll the feeſt of Mychelmas / at
whiche tyme they muſte nedes be at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyamente
at Weſtmynſter / and to excuſe you
we ſhall write letters for the ſame purpoſe / at
whiche ſeaſon if you or any other for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wyll traueyle ſo farre as to come
thyder / they ſhall haue a reaſonable anſwere / 
ſuche as generally the hole counſayle of the

knyghtes ſawe what aunſwere they had / and
coulde haue none other / they aunſwered and
<pb n="ccxxx" facs="tcp:22067:244"/>
ſayd. Syr we are contente with that ye haue
ſayd / lette vs haue our letters and we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne.
Than their letters were delyuered to
them / and ſo toke their leaue of the kynge and
of other lordes / and ſo came fro Wyndeſore to
London and / made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> redy to departe. The
kyng of Englande cauſed all their ceſtes and
charges to be payed for / and conueyed to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer / 
and there taryed a fyue dayes for lacke of
wynde / and on the ſixte day they departed and
aryued at Boloyne / and whanne their horſes
were vnſhypped they rode to Amye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by ſmall
iourneys / &amp; ſo to Paris / and there they founde
the kynge and his lordes. It was aboute the
feeſt of Penthecoſt. Their letters were redde / 
wherby they vnderſtode the ordynau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the
englyſſhmen. As it was ſhewed me the kynge
nor his counſayle toke lytell regarde to the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter / 
for within a ſeaſon after they had moche
ado in other places.

was a knyght of great lygnage / 
but he was farre out of the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
kynges grace and the duke of
Thourayns. if he dyd ſomoche to cauſe them
to be diſpleaſed with him he dyd yuell. ye haue
herde alſo howe he was gone in to Bretayne
to the duke / who ſhewed hym that the yuell
wyll that the kynge bare hym was by the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
of ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon. It may well be
that he was ſo enfourmed / in that he hadde ſo
great hate to the conſtable ſir Olyuer of Clyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon / 
for he ſtudyed euer after howe to dyſtroy
hym. Thus whyle ſyr Peter of Craon was
with the duke of Bretaygne / they wolde often
tymes comune togyder / and deuiſe howe they
myght bringe ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon to dethe / 
for they ſayd that and he were ones deed there
was none y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wolde greatly reuenge his dethe.
The duke repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted hym that he had nat ſlayne
hym whan he had hym in priſone / and wolde
as than that it had coſte hym a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande

duke had ſuche hatred to ſyr Olyuer of Clyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon / 
he purpoſed a marueylous ymaginacien
in himſelfe / for by apparau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce men ſhulde gyue
iudgement. This knyght thought howe ſo
euer it were that he wolde ſlee the conſtable / 
and thought to entende to nothynge els tyll he
had ſlayne hym with his owne handes / or cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
hym to be ſlayne / and afterwarde entreat
for peace. He douted nothyng Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Blois / 
nor the ſonne of the Vicounte of Rohan / who
had wedded two of the conſtables doughters / 
he thought to do well ynough with theym as
longe as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke was on his parte / for he ſawe
well the ſtrengthe and puyſſaunce of Bloys
was greatly feblyſſhed / for the Erle Guy of
Bloys had ſolde the herytage of Bloys to the
duke of Thourayn / whiche ſhulde haue ronne
by ſucceſſyon to therle of Pointhycur Iohan
of Bloys / wherby he thought that the duke of
Thourayne ſhewed hym but ſmall loue nor
alyaunce of lynage / to bye away his enhery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce / 
wherfore this ſyr Peter thought if ſyr
Olyuer of Clyſſon were deed / ſone to apeaſe
the kynges yuell wyll and the duke of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayns / 
and therby ſone to ouercome the lorde
de la Ryuer and ſyr Iohan Mercyer / Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu / 
the Begue of Villayns / and ſyr Iohan
of Bulle / and other of the Kynges chambre / 
ſuche as ſuſteyned the conſtable. for he knewe
well that the duke of Berrey and the duke of
Burgoyne loued them nothynge in wardely / 
whatſoeuer they ſhewed outwardly. Thus ſir
Peter of Craon perceyuered ſtyll in his opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon / 
and deuyſed in his imagynacion by the
entyſyng of the dyuell / who neuer ſlepeth / but
waketh and enbraſeth their hartes to do yuell
that enclyneth to his exortacion. Thus the dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uell
dayly layde the mater before this knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
eyen / or he put the mater to execuſyon / but
if he had iuſtly ymagyned the doutes and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relles /

<pb facs="tcp:22067:245"/>
vyolate and corrupted / and for bycauſe that
ſpecially this ſyr Peter of Craon had ſo great
affection to the dyſtructyon of the conſtable / 
therfore he lyghtly enclyned to the temptacion
to do outrage and folly / and thought that if he
myght ſlee the conſtable and returne agayne
ſafely in to Bretayne / that no man wolde ſeke
hym there if they dyd he truſted that the duke
wolde excuſe hym / and that if the worſte fell / 
that the Frenche kynge came thyder with a
great puyſſaunce / than in a nyght to entre in
to a ſhyppe and ſo to go to Burdeaux to Bay
on / or in to Englande / and there he thought
well he ſhulde nat be purſewed / for he knewe
well that the englyſſhe men hated the conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bycauſe of the crueltyes that he had doone
and conſented to be done ſythe he was tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>SIr Peter of Craon for to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plyſſh

after the dede done by hym and his company / 
he toke the next way he coude in to Bretayne / 
and tooke for his ſauegarde the duke of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taygne.
and alſo before the dede done he ſolde
his caſtelles and herytage that he had in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iou
to the duke of Bretaygne / and renyed his
homage to the frenche kynge / and ſayd howe
he wolde go ouer the ſee. Of all theſe maters
I paſſe breuely / but I ſhall declare the dede / 
for I ſyr Iohan Froyſart auctour of this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory / 
whan this vnhappy dede was doone by
ſyr Peter of Craon / agaynſte ſyr Olyuer of

I ought to be well enfourmed of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / 
acordyng to the enquery that I made ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in

ſyr Peter had in the towne of Parys a fayre
houſe ſtandynge in the churche yarde of ſaynt

to Parys / and they prouyded large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the houſe with wyne / corne / fleſſhe / ſalte / 
and other prouyſyons. Alſo he had writen to
the keper that he ſhulde bye certayne armure

Syr Olyuer of Cliſſon who as than was con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtable

Than ſyr Olyuer toke his leaue of the duke

his horſe taryed at the kynges gate for hym.
Than he mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted on his horſe and all his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany
well armed couertly / and there paſt nat
ſire of his company that knew his entent. and
whan he came in to ſaynte Katheryns ſtreate
there he taryed / and abode priuely for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng. And as ſone as the conſtable
was iſſued out of the ſtreate of ſaynt Powle / 
and came in to the hyghe ſtreate and his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
beſyde hym / and came rydynge talkyng
with a ſquyer of his / ſayenge. To morowe I
muſt haue at dyner with me y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne / 
the lorde Coucy / ſyr Iohan of Vyen / 
ſyr Charles Dangers / the barone of Vrey /

that they lacke nothynge. And ſayeng
of thoſe wordes ſyr Peter Craon and his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany
came on hym / and at the firſt they ſtrake
out the torches. And whan the conſtable herde
the ruſſhynge of the horſes behynde hym / no
thought it had been the duke of Thourayne
that had folowed and ſported with hym / and
ſayde. Ah ſyr it is yuell doone / but I pardon
you / ye are yonge and full of play and ſporte.
With thoſe wordes ſyr Peter of Craon drewe
out his ſwerde and ſaid / ſlee the conſtable ſlee
hym / for he ſhall dye. What arte thou quod
Clyſſon that ſpekeſt thoſe wordes? I am Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

make ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / and therwith ſtrake at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable / 
and ſyr Peters men drewe oute their
ſwordes and ſtrake at the conſtable / who had
no wepon / but a ſhorte knyfe of two foote of
length / and defended hym ſelfe as well as he
myght / and his men were without armure / 
and ſone put a brode fro their mayſter. Than
ſyr Peters men ſayd ſhall we ſlee them all. yea
quod ſir Peter / all ſuche as make any defence.
Their defence was but ſmall / for they were
but eight perſones and without armure. Sir
Peter demaunded nothynge but the dethe of
the conſtable / ſome that were there whan they
knewe it was the conſtable they gaue him but
faynte ſtrokes / for a thynge doone by trayſon
is doone cowardly without any hardyneſſe.
The conſtable defended hymſelfe valyauntly
with that wepyn that he had / howe be it his
defence hadde vayled hym but lytell / and the
great grace of god had nat ben. Styll he ſate
on his horſe tyll he had a full ſtroke on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heed / 
with whiche ſtroke he fell fro his horſe ryght
agaynſt a bakers dore / who was vp and buſy
to bake breed / and had left his dore halfe open
whiche was happy for the conſtable / for as he
fell fro his horſe he fell agaynſte the dore / and
the dore opened and he fell in at the dore / and
they that were a horſebacke coulde nat entre
after hym / the dore was to lowe and to lytell.
God ſhewed great grace to the conſtable / for
if he had fallen in the ſtreates as he dyde in at
the dore / or if the dore had been ſhytte / he had
ben ſlayn without remedy / but they that were
a horſebacke durſte nat alyght / and alſo they
thought / and ſo dyd ſyr Peter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> on the ſtroke
<pb facs="tcp:22067:246"/>
that he had on the heed / that at laſte it ſhulde
be his dethes wounde. Than ſyr Peter ſayd / 
go we hence / we haue done ynough / for if he
be nat deed / he wyll dye on the ſtroke that he
hathe on the heed / for it was a great ſtroke.
Therwith they departed and rode a waye a
good pace to the gate of ſaynte Anthony / and
rode out therat / for as than the gate was open
and had ben ten yere / ſythe the frenche kynge
retourned fro the batayle of Roſebeque / and
that the ſayd conſtable put downe the malles
of Parys / and punyſſhed them for their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyons.</p>
            <p>THus ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon was lefte
in this caſe / as a man halfe deed and
more / in the bakers houſe / who was
ſore abaſſhed whan he knewe it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable / 
as for his men had lytell hurte / for ſyr
Peter and his men loked for nothynge but to

ſore hurte on the heed / and the blode rennynge

ſore abaſſhed / and good cauſe why. there they
made great complayntes / fyrſte they feared

the kyng / as he was goynge to his bedde. Ah
ſyr we canne nat hyde fro you the great myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe

What myſchefe is that quod the kynge? Syr

This diſpyre and outrage is ſo great / that

            <p>IN the meane ſeaſon whyle this voy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>age
was thus ordred / &amp; great brute
therof ſpoken throughe all Frauce.
There retourned to Paris the byſſhoppe of
Noyon and the lorde de la Ryuer fro Foize
and Bierne / and there ſhewed the kyng and
his counſayle howe they had ſpedde. They
were well herde / but the voyage in to Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
buſyed ſo the kyng and his counſayle / 
that they had no leyſar to ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to any other

made his prouiſyon in the waye to Aniou / to

on the ryuer of Loyre / to the entent to go in
to Bretayne / none durſt ſpeke the contrary.</p>
            <p>REnome was throughout all Paris
and (it was well knowen) that ſir
Olyuer of Cliſſon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtable of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce / 
whan he laye thus ſicke of his hurtꝭ made
his teſtament / to the entente that his heyres
ſhulde knowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trouthe of euery thyng that
he had / and where it was. His heyres were
two doughters / the one was maryed to Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han

he that ſir Olyuer had quytte out of priſone
in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / and payde for hym ſixſcore thou
ſande frankes to the duke of Irelande / as it
hath ben ſhewed here before in this hyſtorie.
And his ſeconde doughter was or ſhulde be
vicou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Rohan by reaſon of her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
The ſomme of the teſtament mounted to the
ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of ſeuyntene hundred thouſande fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
beſyde his heritage. Euery man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> herde
therof had great marueyle / howe he ſhulde
gather toguider / ſuche richeſſe / and ſpecially
the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne / &amp; their

ſpake largely &amp; ſayd. What the deuyll howe
maye it be that the conſtable hath gadered to
guider ſo many floreyns / and ſuche mouable
goodes? the kyng hym ſelfe hath nat ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.
It maye well be beleued and knowen / 
that he hath nat won all this by no iuſt mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes.
Thus the mater paſſed / but ſuche as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
hym nat thought neuertheleſſe. Thus
all ſuche as the kynge had written vnto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
them ſelfe to go with hym in to Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taygne.
This voiage pleaſed nothynge the
duke of Burgoyn / he ſayd this was a warre
without reaſon / and that the concluſion ther
of coulde take no good ende / nor the realme
of Fraunce / nor the duchy of Bretayne / nor
the lordes / knightes and ſquyers / in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had
nothynge to do with the warre bytwene ſir
Olyuer of Clyſſon and ſir Peter of Craon.
What nede they quod he to take payne or tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueyle
to make warre in their quarelles? We
ſhulde rather ſuffre them and their owne me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The duke of Berrey was of the ſame opiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / 
but they coude nat be herde nor beleued / 
for the kyng was cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayled contrary to their
opinyons / by ſuche as the kyng loued better
than them. Theſe dukes coude nat tell howe
to breke that enterprice / and whan they ſawe
none other remedy / they obeyed / But that
was ſlouthfully / howe be it by the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon
of the duke of Burgoyne / the erle of
Oſtrenaunt was written vnto by the kynge
to go with hym in this iourney with thre hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred

and whan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e he was redy / and had aſſembled
toguyder his company to his great coſt and

there ſounde the duke who made them good

kynges entent and his counſayls / whervnto
the duke anſwered wiſely and ſagely / &amp; ſaid
Howe it ſhulde be harde for hym to delyuer
ſir Peter of Craon / and ſayd as god myght
helpe hym in all his buſyneſſe / he knewe nat
where he was. Wherfore he deſyred them in
that caſe to holde hym excuſed / But he ſayde
he had well herde of hym a yere paſt / that he
loued nat ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / but wolde
make him mortall warre to his power / what
ſoeuer ende came therof. And at that tyme I
demaunded of hym if he had gyuen ſir Oly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
knowledge therof / and he ſayd he had vt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terly
defyed and wolde ſlee hym if he coude / 
outher by daye or by nyght / where ſoeuer he
coude fynde hym. Of his dedes I knowe no
further / wherfore I haue marueyle that the
kynge wyll make warre agaynſt me for his

bytwene our chyldren by the grace of God / 
ſhall nat be broken on my parte / wherfore I

This was the aunſwere that the duke made
to the Frenche kynges meſſangers / and ſo
whan they hadde taryed a daye at Nauntes /

retourned to Mans to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng / who thought
longe tyll he herde their aunſwere / and as ye

The duke of Bretayne who was well enfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

nat well aſſured / for he ſawe well the dukes of

in a maner repented hym that he had done ſo

            <p>WHan the Frenche kynge had taryed
the ſpace of thre wekes in the cytie of
Mans / and the knyghtes retourned
that he had ſent in to Bretayne. Than he ſayd
ſyth he had herde the dukes anſwere he wolde

was the duke of Bretaygne / who ſuſteyd the
<pb facs="tcp:22067:250"/>
traytour ſyr Peter of Craon. The entencyon
of the kynge was / that if any knyghtes and
ſquyers came agaynſt hym / or that he founde
any townes cloſed he wolde put downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke
for euer / and ſet a gouernour in the countrey
tyll the dukes chyldren were of lawfull age / 
and than rendre to them the berytage / and the
duke neuer to haue any parte theof. This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinyon
the king helde ſtyll and no man coude
put hym therfro. and thus on a fayre daye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute
ten of the clocke the kynge departed fro
the cytie of Mans / and had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his
marſhalles the nyght before to cauſe all his at
mye bothe before and behynde to dyſloge and
to drawe to Angers / and ſayde that he wolde
nat retourne tyll he had ben in Bretayne and
dyſtroyed the traytours that had put hym to
ſo moche payne and trouble. The marſhalles
dyd the kinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. The day that
the king departed was marueylous hoote / for
me ſonne as than naturally was in his cheife
force / and to the entent to declare the trouth of
euery thyng. The ſame ſeaſon that the kynge
lay at Mans / he was ſore traueyled with day<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
ſyttynge in counſayle / and alſo he was nat
perfytely hole nor had nat ben all that ſeaſon / 
he was feble in his brayne and heed / and dyd
eate or drinke but lytell / and nygh dayly was
in a hoote feuer / ſo that he was gretly anoyed
and payned / and alſo for the dyſpleaſure that
he had for the conſtables hurte / he was full of
malencoly and his ſpirytes ſore troubled and
traueyled / and that his phyſicions ſpyed well
and ſo dyd his vncles / but they coulde nat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
it / for no man durſte counſayle hym to
breke his voyage in to Bretaygne. And as it
was enfourmed me / as he rode forwarde in
the foreſt of Mans / a great ſygnifycacyon fell
to hym / by the whiche if he had doone well he
ſhulde haue called his counſayle aboute hym
and well aduyſed hymſelfe or he had gone any
further. Sodaynly there came to the kynge a
poore man bare heeded / bare legged / and bare
footed / and on his body a poore whyte cote / 
he ſemed rather to be a foole than wyſe / and
boldely ſodaynly he toke the brydell of the kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
horſe in his handes and ſtopped the horſe
and ſayd. Syr kyng tyde no further forward
for thou arte betrayed. Thoſe wordes entred
into the kynges heed / wherby he was worſe
dyſpoſed in his helthe than he was before / ſo
that his herte &amp; his blode was moued. Than
the kinges ſeruauntes ſtrake ſo the poore man
that he lette the kynges horſe go / and made no
more of his wordes than of a fooles ſpekyng / 
whiche was foly as dyuers men ſayde / for at
the leſte they ſhulde haue better examyned the
man / and to haue ſene if he had ben a naturall
foole or no / and to haue knowen fro whence he
came / but they dyde nat ſo / but lefte hym be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde / 
&amp; he was neuer ſene after to any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
knowledge / but ſuche as were nere to the
Kynge herde hym ſpeke theſe wordes. The
kynge paſſed forthe / and aboute twelue of the
clocke the kynge paſſed out of the foreſt / and
came in to a great playne all ſandy. the ſonne
alſo was in his heyght &amp; ſhone bright / whoſe
rayes were marueylouſly hote / wherby the
horſes were ſore chafed / and all ſuche perſons
as were armed were ſore oppreſſed with heat.
The knyghtes rode togyther by companyes / 
ſome here and ſome there / and the kynge rode
ſomwhat a parte bycauſe of the duſte / and the
duke of Berrey and the Duke of Burgoyne
rode on his lefte hande talkynge togyther / an
acre brede of lande of fro the kynge. Other lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
as the erle of Marche / ſir Iaques of Bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bone / 
ſyr Charles de la Brethe / ſyr Phylyppe
Darthoys / ſir Henry and ſir Phylip of Bare
ſyr Peter of Nauer and other knyghtes rode
by companyes. the duke of Burbon / the lorde
Coucy / ſyr Charles Dangers / the baron Dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiry
&amp; dyuers other rode on before the kynge / 
and nat in his company / and they deuiſed and
talked togyther / and toke no hede of that fell
ſodaynly on the chefe perſonage of the compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny / 
whiche was on the kynges owne perſone / 
therfore the workes of god are marueylous / 
and his ſcourges are cruell and are to be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of all creatures. There hath been ſene in
the olde teſtament and alſo in the newe / many
fygures and examples therof. We rede howe
Nabugodonoſor kynge of Aſſyryens / who
reygned a ſeaſon in ſuche tryumphant glory / 
that there was none lyke hym / and ſodaynly
in his greateſt force and glory / the ſouerayne
kynge out lorde god kynge of Heuen and of
erthe / fourmer and ordeyner of all thynges / a
parelled this ſayd kynge in ſuche wyſe that he
loſt his wytte and reygne and was ſeuen yers
in that eſtate / and lyued by acornes and maſt
that fell fro the Okes / and other wylde appels
and frutes / and hadde taſt but as a bore or a
ſwyne. and after he had endured this penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="ccxxxvi" facs="tcp:22067:250"/>
god reſtored hym agayne to his memory and
wytte. And than he ſayde to Danyell the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet / 
that there was none other god / but the
god of Iſraell. Nowe the father / the ſonne / 
and the holy gooſt / thre perſones in one god / 
hath ben / is / and euer ſhall be as puiſſaunt to
ſhewe his warkes as euer he was / wherfore
no man ſhulde marueyle of any thyng that he
dothe. Nowe to the purpoſe why I ſpeke all
theſe wordes. A great influence fro heuen fell
the ſayd daye vpon the frenche kynge / and as
dyuers ſayd / it was his owne faute / for acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
to the dyſpoſicyon of his body / and the
ſtate that he was in / and the warnyng that his
phyſicyons dyd gyue hym / he ſhulde nat haue
rydden in ſuche a hoote day / at that houre / but
rather in the mornynge and in the euenynge
in the freſſhe ayre / wherfore it was a ſhame to
them that were nere aboute hym / to ſuffre or
to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle hym to do as he dyd. Thus as the
frenche kynge rode vpon a fayre playne in the
heate of the Sonne / whiche was as than of a
marueylous heyght / and the kynge had on a

               </gap>e couered with blacke veluet / whiche ſore
chafed hym / and on his heed a ſyngle bonet of
ſcarlet / and a chapelet of great perles / whiche
the quene had gyuen hym at his departure / 
and he had a page that rode behynde him / bea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynge
on his heed a chapewe of Montaban / 
bright and clere ſhynynge agaynſt the ſonne / 
and behynde that page rode a nother bearing
the kynges ſpeare / paynted redde / and fryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with ſylke / with a ſharpe heed of ſtele / the
<abbr>lord</abbr> de la Ryuer had brought a doſyn of them
with hym fro Tholouſe / and that was one of
them he had gyuen the hole doſyn to the king / 
and the kynge had gyuen thre of theym to his
brother the duke of Orlyaunce / and thre to the
duke of Burbon. And as they rode thus forth
the page that bare the ſpeare / whether it were
by neclygence or that he fell a ſlepe / he lette the
ſpeare fall on the other pages heed that rode
before hym / and the heed of the ſpeare made
a great claſſhe on the bright chapewe of ſtele.
The kynge (who rode but a fore them) with
the noyſe ſodaynly ſtarted / and his herte trym<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled / 
and in to his imagynacion ranne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſyon
of the wordes of the man that ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
his horſe in the foreſt of Mans / and it ran
in to his thought / that his enemyes ranne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hym to ſlee and diſtroy him / and with that
abuſyon he fell out of his wytte by febleneſſe
of his heed / &amp; daſſhed his ſpores to his horſe / 
and drewe out he ſworde / and tourned to his
pages / hauynge no knowledge of any man / 
wenynge in hymſelfe to be in a batayle inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with his enemyes / and lyfte vp his ſworde
to ſtryke he cared nat where / and cryed and
ſayd. On on vpon theſe traytours. Whan the
pages ſawe the kynge ſo inflamed with Ire / 
they tooke good hede to themſelfe / as it was
tyme. They thought the kynge had ben dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
bycauſe the ſpeare fell downe / thanne
they ſtepte away fro the kynge. The duke of
Orleaunce was nat as than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e farre of fro the
kynge. The kynge came to hym with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſworde in his hande. The kynge was as
than in ſuche a franſey / and his herte ſo feble /

who rode a lytell waye of fro the kynge whan
he herde the ruſſhyng of the horſes / and herde

ſawe howe the kynge with his naked ſworde

myſchife is this / the kynge is nat in his ryght

THus after this maner theſe lordes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

well ſayde quod the duke of Berrey / it were
good we ſtudyed where were beſt to haue the
kynge to lye that he myght the ſoner recouer

be brought to the caſtell of Crayell / where is
good ayre / and a fayre countrey on the ryuer
of Oyſe. whan this was ordeyned than all the
men of warre had leaue to departe / and were

retourne peaſably in to his owne countrey / 
without doynge of any vyolence or domage
to the countreys as they ſhulde paſſe through /

that the kynge was nat well dyſpoſed in his

The people of the realme of Fraunce were
fore abaſſhed whan they knew howe the king

Thus fynally the kyng was brought
to Crayell / and there lefte in the kepynge of

Than euery man departed. And it was
commaunded to hyde and to kepe ſecrete the

but for all that he recouered but lytell helth.

The ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes within the caſtell ſente out to

ſente for by them that had the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernaunce /

and of the ſpirytualtie. For pope Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Auignon had nothyng in the realme

de la Ryuer was brought to Parys / and ſet

The people cared nat ſo moche for the

daylye in Paris / that theſe priſoners ſhulde

were in great daunger / and alſo it was ſayd
that by their counſaile the kyng toke on hym
the iourney in to Bretaygne / wherby he fell
in to that maladye of Franſey / and had gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

Suche maters were layde to the lorde de la

In this caſe they were in Priſone a greate

The churche was ſo ſubiecte / what by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Oftentymes the good lady wolde fall on her

kynge / I loued hym entierly / and tooke hym
for a wyſe and a ſage knyght. but ſythe ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre

and rather at your deſyre than and all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme

pleaſed with her lordes wordes / for ſurely and
ſhe had nat ben he had been deed / but for her
ſake the duke of Berrey dyſſymuled the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter /

howe be it for all the promeſſe that was

            <p>WHyle theſe two knyghtes were thus
in priſone more than a yere / and no
man knewe what ende ſhulde come
of them. Than the dukes and their counſayle
dyd all that they coulde to haue taken ſir Oly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer

and offyce. They had rather haue had
hym than all the reſydewe / but he kepte hym
ſelfe out of their handes / wherin he dyd wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / 
for if he had ben taken they had ſo ordeyned
for him / that he ſhulde haue had iudgement of

pleaſed therby his aduerſary the duke of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taygne / 
who neuer dyd good in the realme of

to ſuch articles as he was accuſed of / on payne
to leſe his honour and to be banyſſhed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme
of Fraunce / certayne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myſſioners were
ſent in to Bretaygne to ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon hym to apere.
They that were ſente rode in to Bretaygne / 
and demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded where as they came where ſyr
Olyuer of Clyſſon was / and ſayd howe they
were ſente by the kynge to ſpeke with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable / 
wherfore they deſyred to knowe where
he was. The men of ſuche townes and gary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as helde of the conſtable were determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before what aunſwere to make / and ſayd / 
ſyrs ye be welcome / and if ye wyll ſpeke with
the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtable ye muſte go in to ſuche a place / 
there we thynke ye ſhall fynde hym without

towne to towne / but they coude nat fynde him.
And ſo longe they ſought that they were we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry / 
and ſo retourned to Parys / and declared
what they had ſene and founde. ſuche as had
accuſed hym were gladde that he dalte ſo / for
than they ſayd his falſneſſe was playnely ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed / 
and therby acordyng to reaſon they ſaid
he ſhulde haue as he had deſerued. Than by
the courſe of the parlyament they proceded to
all his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monynges / to thentent that ſuche as
loued hym ſhulde nat ſay he had any wronge / 
by Enuy or hatred. And whan all his .xv. ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monynges
were accompilſſhed / and that they
coulde here no tydynges of hym / nor of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunce / 
and that he had been openly called
at the parlyament chambre dore / and on the
ſteyres / and in the courte / with all other ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes
therto belongynge / and no anſwere
made for hym / he had proceſſe made agaynſt
hym cruelly in the parlyament. There he was
openly banyſſhed the realme of Fraunce as a

and iudged to pay a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thouſande marke

the duke of Orleaunet was deſyred to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent /

who in his dayes had ſo moche traueyled for
the realme of Fraunce / and as than was put

he appered nat at their ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monynge / for if he

than the duke of Orlyance durſt nat ſpeke for

of Bretaygne and ſyr Peter of Craon were
right ioyfull of thoſe tydinges howe be it they
were ſory that he was nat priſoner in Parys
as well as ſir Iohan Mercier and the <abbr>lord</abbr> de

brute ranne therof in the realme of Fraunce
and elſ where. ſome compleyned ſecretly and
ſayd that he had wronge. And ſome other ſaid
he was worthy to be hanged / and that he had
well deſerued it. and moreouer ſayd / howe the

he coulde neuer gette that by ryghtwyſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / 
but rather by pollynge and robbyng / and
retaynyng to hymſelfe the wages of the poore
knyghtes &amp; ſquyers of the realme of Fraunce
that had deſerued it. as it may well appere in
the chaunceryor treaſory / where euery thyng
is written and regeſtred / in the voyage that
the Kynge made in to Flaunders. there and
than he reyſed great profyte to his owne vſe / 
and alſo in the voyage to Almayne / for all ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
of tayles and ſubſydyes that were reyſed
in the Realme to paye men of warre / paſſed
through his handes he payed where as it plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
hym / and the reſt he kept to hymſelfe and
none durſte ſpeke agaynſt it. In this maner
ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon was accuſed in many
mennes mouthes. It is ſayde in an olde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urebe / 
he that hath myſfortune / euery man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth

duke of Berrey / and the duke of Burgoyne
had nat ben / the duke of Bretaygne had ben
able to haue ſubdued ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon / 
ſeynge he was in the dukes countrey / but he
ſuffred hym for a ſeaſon to ſe howe the maters
ſhulde procede. Alſo he ſawe well that ſyr Oly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
of Clyſſon was ſet on the heyght of fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
whele / and as than agayne he ſawe howe
he was caſt downe / and lyke to leſe his offyce.
Thus the duke of Bretayne and ſyr Peter of
Craon were ſet vpon their fete / and all by the
workes of fortune / whiche is neuer parma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent / 
but nowe vp / nowe downe. The conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon / the lorde de la Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer / 
&amp; ſyr Iohan Mercyer / were principally
acuſed for the chefe couſers of the kinges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady.
And ſuche as loued them nat / ſayd howe
they had poyſoned the kynge. howe be it eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man maye conſydre by reaſon that it was
nat ſo / for they were the perſones that ſhulde
leſe moſte by the kynges malady / wherfore
it is to be thought they ſought moſte for his
helthe / but they coulde nat be beleued. So the
two knyghtes remayned ſtyll in priſon in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger
openly to haue loſte their heedes / and by
all lykelyhode ſo they had doone / if the kynge
had nat recouered his helth / and by the meane
of the ducheſſe of Berrey / who made inſtante
labour for the lorde de la Ryuer. And the lorde
Clyſſon was ſtyll in Bretayne / and made ſore

            <p>TRewe it is this ſyckneſſe that the kyng
tooke in the voyage towardes Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne / 
greatly abated the ioye of the realme of
Fraunce / and good cauſe why / for whan the
heed is ſicke the body canne haue no ioye. No
man durſte openly ſpeke therof / but kepte it
priuy as moche as myght be / and it was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly
kept fro the quene / for tyll ſhe was dely<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uered
and churched ſhe knewe nothynge ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of / 
whiche tyme ſhe had a doughter. The phy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſycion
mayſter Guyllyam / who had the chefe
charge of healynge of the kynge / was ſtyll a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boute
hym / and was ryght dyligent / and well
acquyted hymſelfe / wherby he gate bothe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and profyte / for lytell &amp; lytell he brought
the kynge in good eſtate / and toke away the ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
and the heate / and made hym to haue taſte
and appetyte to eate and drinke / ſlepe &amp; reſt / 
and knowledge of euery thynge. howe be it he
was very feble / and lytell and lytell he made
the Kynge to ryde a huntynge and on haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge.
And whanne tydynges was knowen
through Fraunce howe the kynge was well
mended / and had his memory agayne / euery
man was ioyfull / and thanked god. the kyng
thus beyng at Crayell / deſyred to ſe the quene
<pb n="ccxlii" facs="tcp:22067:256"/>
his wyfe and the Dolphyn his ſonne. So the
quene came thyder to him / and the chylde was
brought thyder. The kynge made them good
chere / and ſo lytell and lytell through the helpe
of god / the kynge recouered his helthe. And
whan mayſter Guyllyam ſawe the kynge in
ſo good caſe / he was ryght ioyfull / as reaſone
was / for he had done a fayre cure / and ſo dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
hym to the dukes of Orlyance / Berrey / 
Burgoyne / and Burbone / and ſayd. My lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / 
thanked be god the kyng is nowe in good
ſtate and helth / ſo I delyuer hym / but beware
lette no man dyſpleaſe hym / for as yet his ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytes
be nat fully ferme nor ſtable / but lytell
and lytell he ſhall waxe ſtronge. Reaſonable
dyſporte / reſt / and myrthe ſhall be moſte pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytable
for hym / and trouble hym as lytell as
may be with any counſayles / for he hath been
ſharpely handeled with a hote malady. Than
it was conſydred to retaygne this mayſter
Guylliam / and to gyue hym that he ſhulde be
contente with all / whiche is the ende that all
phyſicions requyre / to haue gyftes and rewar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des.
He was deſyred to abyde ſtyll aboute the
kynge / but he excuſed himſelfe and ſayd howe
he was an olde impotent man / and coulde nat
endure the maner of courte / wherfore he deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to returne in to his owne countrey. Whan
the counſayle ſawe he wolde none otherwyſe
do / they gaue him leaue / and at his departing
gaue him a thouſande crownes / and retayned
hym in wages with four horſes whan ſo euer
he wolde reſorte to the courte. Howe be it I be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue
he neuer came there after / for whan he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned
to the cytie of Laon / there he conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
and dyed a ryche man. He lefte behynde
hym a .xxx. thouſande frankes. All his dayes
he was one of the greateſt nygardes that euer
was / all his pleaſure was to get good / and to
ſpende nothynge / for in his howſe he neuer
ſpente paſt two ſouſes of Parys in a day / but
wolde eate and drinke in other mennes how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes / 
where as he myght get it. With this rodde
lyghtly all phyſicyons are beaten.

None durſte come nere theym / they that dyd
brente their handes / by reaſon of the heate of

aduyſed hym howe the botry was therby / he
fled thyder / and caſt himſelfe in to a veſſell full

ſaued hym / or els he had ben deed as the other

the quene herde the crye that they made / ſhe
douted her of the Kynge / for ſhe knewe well
that he ſhulde be one of the ſyxe / wherwith ſhe
fell in a ſowne / and knightes and ladyes came
and comforted her. a pyteous noyſe there was
in the hall. The ducheſſe of Berrey delyuered
the kynge fro that parell / for ſhe dyd caſte ouer

fro the fyre. The kynge wolde haue gone fro
her. Whyder wyll ye go quod ſhe / ye ſe well
howe your company brennes? What are ye? I

Therwith the kynge departed out of the hall / 
and in all haſte chaunged his apparell / and
came to the quene. And the ducheſſe of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey
had ſomwhat comforted her / and had ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed

Therwith the kynge came to the quene / and
as ſoone as ſhe ſawe hym / for ioy ſhe enbraſed
hym and fell in a ſowne. Than ſhe was borne
in to her chambre / and the kynge wente with
her. And the baſtarde of Foiz who was all on
a fyre / cryed euer with a loude voyce. ſaue the
kynge / ſaue the kynge. Thus was the kynge
ſaued. It was happy for hym that he went fro
his company / for els he had ben deed without

mydnyght in the hall of ſaynt Powle in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys /

yuell whanne he put downe the torche. Than
the duke ſayde. Syrs lette euery man knowe
there is no man to blame for this cauſe but all

            <p>THe next daye theſe newes ſpredde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode

had merueyle therof. and ſome ſayd
howe God had ſente that token for an enſam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple / 
and that it was wyſedome for the kynge
to regarde it / and to withdrawe hym ſelfe
fro ſuche yonge ydell wantonneſſe / whiche
he had vſed ouermoche beynge a kyng. The
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons of the cytie of Parys murmured &amp;
ſayd. Beholde the great myſhappe and myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
that was lykely to haue fallen on the

myght haue ben ſure none of them ſhulde ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue

As ſoone as the dukes of Berrey and of Bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>goyne

and marueyled greatly. They lepte
on their horſes and rode to the kyng / and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted

he ſhewed his vncles howe his aunt

was very ſorie for the dethe of the erle of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye / 
of ſir yuan of Foiz / and of ſir Charles

ſayde. Sir / that is loſte canne nat be recoue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red:

there was a treatie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage

&amp; the yong wydowe
lady of Berrey / ſomtyme
called cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teſſe of Dunoys
and wyfe to Loyes of Bloys. The Frenche
kynge wolde gladly haue had this maryage
auaunſed / but the duke of Berrey was natre
wyllynge therto / for he thought the erldome
of Ewe but a ſmall thyng / as to the regarde
of her fyrſte huſbande / wherfore he thought
to mary her more highlyer. In dede the lady
was beautifull &amp; endued with all vertues / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ſhulde aperteyne to a noble lady. Howe be
it finally / the duke of Berrey was lothe to
diſpleaſe the kynge / yet he had many offers
made hym for his doughter / as by the yonge
duke of Loreyne / by the erle of Armynake / &amp;
by the ſonne and heyre of the Erle of Foiz.
The kynge brake of all theſe maryages / and
ſayd to his vncle. Fayre vncle of Berrey / we
wyll nat that ye ſhall putte our coſyn youre
doughter come of the Floure delyce / in to ſo
farre countreys / we ſhall prouyde for her a

he ſawe well that the kynge enclyned his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to his coſyn the lorde Philyppe of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thois / 
who was a yonge luſty knyght and of

and had atchyued many voyages to his

the duke of Berrey thought / that if he were
conſtable of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / he ſhulde than haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fycient
to mentayne his eſtate. On this the
two dukes determyned to ſpeke to the kynge
and ſo they dyde / and ſaid to hym. Sir / your
counſayle generally are all agreed / that the
lorde Philyp of Arthoys be preferred to the
offyce of conſtableſhyp of Fraunce / whiche
is nowe voyde. For by iugement of your ꝑ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyament / 
Olyuer of Clyſſon hath forfayted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
offyce / whiche maye nat be long vacant / but
it ſhulde be preiudyce to the realme. And ſir /

the office is voyde / we can nat tell where
ye ſhulde better enploy it / than on hym. He
ſhall right well exerciſe it: he is welbeloued

without enuy or couytouſneſſe. Theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
pleaſed well the kyng / who anſwered &amp;
ſaid. Vncle (if it voyde) we had rather he
had it than another. The kyngꝭ vncles ſued
ſtyll for the lorde Philyppe of Arthoys / for
the duke of Berrey hated ſir Olyuer of Cliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon /

aſſented / ſo that the duke of Berrey wolde a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gre

the quene of Hieruſalem and Iohan of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taygne / 
who receyued them right honorably
for the honour of the Frenche kynge. There
they taryed two dayes / and demaunded ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes

he was ſo flyttyng fro one place to another /

and rode nat lightly forthe out of the towne / 
for he euer douted the buſſhmentes of his en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nemye

harde warre made bytwene them / that there

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Han<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e theſe Frenche knyghtes

            <p>THus they toke leaue of the duke and

Than anone after proceded the maryage by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene
the lorde Philippe of Arthois and the

yet the lorde Olyuer of Clyſſon had nat

And knewe well / all that was done agaynſt

coude haue none other conforte of them / and
parceyued well howe he loſt and was lykely

            <p>WHan theſe lordes of Bretayne ſawe
they coude haue non other anſwere
they tooke their leaues and retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

what they had done / but in no wyſe the duke
wolde conſente to ſende his ſonne to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell

ſtyll / wherby no perſone durſt ryde abrode / 
and marchaundyſe was layde downe / tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughe
whiche the people of good townes &amp;

that quarell agaynſt ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon.
They alwayes diſſymuled the mater except

the lorde Olyuer of Clyiſon / and ſecretely ſo
coured hym with men / and ſente hym horſes.
Sir Olyuer of Glyſſon roode ofter abrode
than the duke dyde. And it fortuned on a day

were taken and brought to ſir Olyuer / who
was gladde of them: He knewe them well / 
one of them hadde done hym ſeruyce in tyme

Remembreſt thou nat howe in the Caſtell of

towarde the caſtell of Alroy / where the

to cary to their lodgynges lyke forragers.
Whan the lorde Olyuer came on them / they

Sirs / howe dare ye come in to the feldes / to

ye neuer ſowed them / and yet ye cutte theym

and ſaye to the duke of Breraygne who is in
Alroy / that if he wyll come or ſende his men

englyſſhe clerkes and lawyers proued reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

chauncelours of Fraunce argued to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary / 
and ſayd / as to retourne all the landes
agayne to the gouernynge of the kyng of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande
and his ſucceſſours / was impoſſyble

awaye whan the peace was concluded at
Bretygny / and after confermed and ſealed at
Calays / wherby they were clene put a way fro
the kyng of Englande / whiche peace &amp; graun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
was made in the yere of our lorde god a
thouſande thre hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred threſcore and one / and
thervpon the frenche kyng graunted to ſuche

agayne nor reuoked / wherfore they ſayd
that if the Englyſſhemen purpoſed to haue
peace / they ſhulde drawe to ſome nerer poynt.
Than by delyberacyon of the foure dukes / it
was deuyſed that the frenche men as well as
the englyſſhmen ſhulde put all their demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
in writynge / &amp; the ſame to be delyuered to
eyther partye / that they might be regarded at
length on bothe partes / and ſuche as were vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reaſonable
to be raſed and cancelled / and ſuch
as were good to be vpholden. this ordynau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
ſemed to all parties good and reaſonable. Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
this ordre was taken y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſour dukes had to
moche buſyneſſe to do ſpecyally the englyſſhe
men had moche payne to here and to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
the frenche men / who were full of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyle
wordes / and cloked perſwacions and dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
of vnderſtandynge / the whiche the frenche
men wolde rouine as they lyſt / to their profyte
and aduauntage whiche englyſſhe men vſe
nat in their langage / for their ſpeche and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
is playne. And alſo the engliſſhmen were
enfourmed that the Frenche men had nat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
vpholden the artycles / promyſes / and
condycyons / ratyfied in the artycles of peace / 
yet the frenchmen <abbr>wold</abbr> euer fynde one poynte
or other in their writynges / by ſome ſubtyle
cloked worde / affermynge that the englyſſhe
men had broken the peace / and nat they. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
whan the englyſſhe men ſawe or herde in
the frenche mens writynges any darke or clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
worde / they made it to be examyned by
ſuche as were profoundly lerned in the lawe / 
and if they founde it a myſſe / they cauſed it to
be canſelled and amended / to the entent they
wolde leaue nothynge in trouble. And the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyſſhmen
to excuſe themſelfe / wolde ſay that
frenche men letnynge ſuche ſubtylties in their
youth / muſte nedes be more ſubtyle than they.
Somtyme ſuche frowarde wordes bytwene
the parties greatly draue of the tyme of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
The frenche men helde them ſelfe fre / and
thought they ſhulde nat be charged with no
ſuche demaundes / as to make reſtytucy on of
all the landes / with the apendances pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
to the duchy of Acquytayne / with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerages
of that hath ben leuyed ſyth the warre
renewed / to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche they wolde neuer acorde.
The frenche men offred to rendre the countre
of Terbe and of Bygore / and the countye of
Piergourt and Pyergyns / and the countie of
Agen and Agenoys. but Kaours / Rouer gue / 
Ouercy / and Lymoſyn / they <abbr>wold</abbr> in no wyſe
delyuer / nor the countie of Ponthyeur / nor of
the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of Guyſnes / more than the englyſſh
men hadde in their handes at the ſame tyme.
Thus theſe lordes contynued a fyftene dayes
and made no concluſyon / but theſe dukes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyned
to ſende worde to the two kynges / 
to gyue them knowledge what they had done.
The frenche dukes rode to Abbeuyle and ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the kynge all the mater / and howe they
had deſyred their coſins of Englande to write
the hole treatie to the kynge of Englande / and
ſo they ſayd they had promyſed to do. And as
I was enfourmed / on the englyſſhe party the
duke of Gloceſtre was harder to entreat than
the duke of Lancaſtre / and bycauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of Englande knewe ſomwhat of his en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent
therfore they agreed that he ſhulde be ſent
to this treatye / for they knewe well that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
ſhulde paſſe hym without it were for
the honour of the realme. Thus theſe four du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
amyably departed eche fro other / and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluded
to mete there agayne the nynth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Thus theſe englyſſhe lordes retourned to
Calays / and the frenche lordes to Boloyne / 
and ſo to Abuyle. That tyme in Abuyle there
was a fayre garden / cloſed with the ryuer of
Somme / whereas often tymes the frenche
kynge paſſed the tyme. He ſayd to his brother
of Orlyaunce and to his counſayle / that his
beynge at Abbeuyle dyd hym moche good in
his helthe. There was there the ſame ſeaſone
with the kynge / the kynge Lyon of Armony / 
newly come thyder out of Grece / and out of
<pb n="ccxlviii" facs="tcp:22067:262"/>
thoſe marches / in to his owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey he durſt
nat entre / for the turkes had conquered it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the ſtronge towne of Conych / ſtandynge
on the ſee ſyde / whiche the geno ways helde
and kepte for doute of the turkes / for if the tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
had gotten that porte / they ſhulde haue
doone moche yuell by the ſee to the cyprians
and to the Rodes / and other boundes of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.
The kyng of Armony wolde glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haue hadde peace bytwene Englande and
Fraunce / in truſt that all yonge knightes and
ſquyers ſhulde go in to Grece to helpe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere
agayne his realme of Armony. Whan
the frenche kynges vncles were come to Abbe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyle / 
the kynge was gladde and made theym
good chere / and demaunded howe they had
ſpedde / and they ſhewed hym all the hole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe / 
and vpon what poynte they departed / 
wherof the kynge was gladde / for he ſhewed
to be glad to haue peace. In lyke maner the en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glyſſh
dukes whan they came to Calays they
wrote to the kynge of Englande all the poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and artycles of that treatye. And ſhortly
they had agayne a good aunſwere / co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
them to procede for a peace / ſayenge the
warre had contynewed longe ynoughe / and
that cryſtendome therby was ſore do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maged.
Thus at the daye prefyxed / theſe dukes mette
agayne at Balyngham / and with the frenche
lordes came the kynge of Armony / to ſhewe to
the lordes of Englande his buſyneſſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſyte.
He was well knowen with the duke of
Glouceſtre / for he had ben in Englande whan
the frenche army was ordeyned at Sluſe / to
haue gone in to Englande. The duke of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtre
the ſame tyme receyued the kynge of Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mony
and made hym good chere / at a fayre
place of his in Eſſer / called Plaſſhey. At Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngham
alſo the Dukes of Englande made
the kynge of Armony good chere / and was
glad to here hym ſpeke. And they aunſwered
hym that gladly they wolde ayde hym / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the kynge was ryght ioyfull. Many thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
were treated in this parlyament. And all
this ſeaſon the cardynall of Line lay at Abbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyle / 
who was ſente thyder in legacyon / by
hym that called hym ſelfe pope Clemente / for
maters concernyng the churche. The frenche
dukes at this aſſemble at Balyngham / wolde
haue had certayne artycles compriſed in their
treatie / concernynge the churche / and ſuſtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
the opynyons of this pope Clemente / 
Robert of Geneue. But whan the Englyſſhe
dukes harde that / they ſayd to their coſyns of
Fraunce. Coſyns / and ye wyll that we ſhall
fall to any poynte of concluſion / ſpeke no more
of that cardynall / we haue nothyng to do with
hym / his matter is a buſynes without profyte
or effecte / we are determyned vpon a pope to
whom we wyll obey / we wyll here no ſpekyng
agaynſte hym / if the other medle any thynge
with vs we ſhall departe and god hence / and
leaue all togytder. After that tyme there was
no mo wordes of that cardynall / he taried ſtyll
at Abbcuyle. Than theſe lordes proceded in
their treaties / the duke of Lancaſtre was well
enclyned to haue peace. The Frenche kynge
the yere before hadde ſore deſyred hym to be a
good meane to entreate for a peace / and ſo he
promyſed to do. howbeit his brother the duke
of Glouceſtre was <abbr>hard</abbr> to agree / for he layde
forthe the frenchemens dyſceytes and colored
wordes that they vſed alwayes in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges / 
ſayenge howe the frenche men wolde
alwayes wreſtell with their armes dyſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red / 
whiche was euer perceyued. On a daye
there came a ſquyer of honour a frenche man / 
called Robert the hermyte to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtre / 
he was one of the frenche kynges priuy
chambre / whether he was ſente to the duke of
Gloceſtre or came on his owne heed / I can nat
tell / but as the duke ſhewed me in Englande
at Plaſſhey / this ſquyer ſayd to him. Syr for
the loue of god be nat agaynſt this treatie of
peace / for ye ſe howe the lordes of Fraunce do
their dyligence to bringe it aboute / ye ſhall do
an almeſſe dede / for the warre hath to longe
endured / and ſythe that bothe kynges are con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent
to haue peace / all their ſubgiettes ought
to obey therto. Than the duke anſwered hym
as he ſayd. Roberte I am nat agaynſt it / nor
wyll nat be / but ye frenche men amonge you / 
ye haue ſo many coloured wordes / ſo darke
and obſcure to our vnderſtandynge / ſo that
whan ye wyll it is warre / and whan ye lyſt it
is peace / thus haue ye ledde vs vnto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente
daye. But if the kynge my ſoueraygne
lorde had beleued me / and ſuche other of his
realme as are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to ſerue hym / peace ſhul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
neuer haue been bytwene Englande and
Fraunce / tyll reſtytucyon had ben made to vs
of all that is taken fro vs without cauſe / by
ſubtylte and crafte / as god and all the worlde
knoweth. But ſythe the kynge my ſouerayne
<pb facs="tcp:22067:263"/>
lorde enclyneth to the peace / it is reaſone that
we agree to the ſame. and therfore if we make
a peace acordyng to the deſyres of bothe kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / 
ſythe we be here aſſembled / let it be well
holden on your ſyde / for it ſhall be well kepte
on our partye. And thus the duke ſhewed me
that this Roberte the Hermyte departed fro
hym / and went to his company. And ſo theſe

very longe / for ſuche aduentures are ſoone

I demaunded of hym the maner of the Hole
that is in Irelande / called ſaynt Patrykes

ſayd / howe they entred in to the hoole &amp; were
cloſed in at the ſonne goynge downe / and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
there all nyght / and the nexte mornyng
iſſued out agayne at the ſon riſyng. Than I
demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it he had any ſuche ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſightes

<pb facs="tcp:22067:267"/>
And after they had ſytte there a ſeaſon / they
had great deſyre to ſlepe / and ſo fell a ſlepe
and ſlepte there all nyght. Than I demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that if in their ſlepe they knewe where
they were / or what viſyons they had: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

otherwyſe / than they were wont to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
in their Chambres: and in the mornynge
they iſſued out / and within a ſhorte ſeaſon / 
clene forgate their dreures &amp; viſyons / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſayde / he thought all that mater was
but a fantaſy. Than I lefte ſpekyng any fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
of that matter / bycauſe I wolde fayne
haue knowen of hym what was done in the
voyage in Irelande. And I thought as tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to haue demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded what the kyng had done
in that iourney / but than company of other
knyghtes came and fell in communycacion
with hym / ſo that I lefte my purpoſe for that
tyme. Thus we robe to Ledes / and thyder
came the kyng and all his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany / and there
I founde the lorde Edmonde duke of yorke.
Than I went to hym and delyuered my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
fro the erle of Heynaulte his coſyn / and
fro the erle of Oſtrenaunt. The duke knewe
me well and made me good chere and ſayde.
Sir Iohan / holde you alwayes nere to vs /

we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de therto for the loue of tyme paſt
and for loue of my lady the olde Quene my

hym as reaſon requyred. So I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunſed
by reaſon of hym and ſir Thomas

I was brought in to the kynges cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre /

ſhewed nat the kynge the boke that I hadde

wolde rather kepe and defende them agaynſt
all men / as his herytage / and deſyred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred

<pb facs="tcp:22067:268"/>
was nat in the kynge of Englandes power to
gyue them away to another lorde / nor to put
them fro the crowne of Englande. Theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes
and denyenges were longe a deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng / 
bytwene the duke of Lancaſtre and the
lordes and townes of Gaſcon. And whan the
duke ſawe none other remedy / than he made
requeſt to the countrey that the prelates and
noble men / and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaylours of the good tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
ſhulde ſende ſuffycient perſonages to the
kynge of Englande and to his counſayle / and
howe he wolde ſende in lykewyſe notable per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſones
of his counſayle. and loke what ſo euer
the kyng and his counſayle ſhulde determyne
in that cauſe / he promyſed ſurely to abyde ther
by / whether it were with hym or agaynſt him.
Than they of Gaſcon conſydred well that his
requeſt was reaſonable / and agreed to do as
the duke had deſyred. Than the duke rode to
Burdeaur / and was lodged in the abbey of
ſaint Andrewes / where he had ben lodged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tyme. Than they of the cytie of Bayon
and Dar / apoynted ſuffycient perſonages to
ſende in to Englande and the barons of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcon
vnder the kinges obeyſaunce / ſent in lyke
wyſe. Alſo ye ſhall knowe that whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frenche
kyng and his vncles vnderſtode that the duke
of Laucaſtre was peaſably entred in to the cy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
of Burdeaux / and knewe nat for what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent / 
nor whether he wolde kepe or breake the
trewce. Than he and his counſayle determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to ſende to hym / to knowe ſomwhat of his
entent. There was apoynted to go / the lorde
Boucyquant marſhall of Fraunce / the lorde
Iohan of caſtell Morante / and Iohan Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of Barroys / and they to haue with them a
thouſande ſpeares. Thus they rode forth tyll
they came to the cytie of Agen / and there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed.
Than they ſent harauldes and meſſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to Burdeaux to the duke of Lancaſtre / 
ſhewynge hym howe they wolde gladly ſpeke
with hym. The duke made theſe meſſangers
good chere / and wrote agayne to theſe lordes / 
certifyeng them / that where as they had great
deſyre to ſpeke with hym / in lykewyſe he had
the ſame to ſpeke with them / and bycauſe they
ſhulde take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſe payne he promyſed to come
and mete with them at Bergerate. And whan
the frenche lordes ſawe this letter / they gaue
credence therto and ordred them there after / 
and as ſone as they knewe that the duke was
come to Bergerate / they departed fro Agen
and rode thyder. There they were receyued
and lodged in the towne / and their company
in the ſubbarbes. Theſe lordes ſpake with the
Duke and ſhewed hym their meſſage. The
duke receyued them ſwetely / and aunſwered
and ſayd / howe he wolde be a good &amp; a kynde
neyghbour to the frenche kyng and the realme
and to kepe and mayntayne the trewce taken
bytwene the two kynges / for he ſayde he hym
ſelfe was one of the princypalles that ayded to
make and ordayn that truce / wherfore he ſayd
he ought nat nor <abbr>wold</abbr> nat breke it / therof they
myght be well aſſured. The dukes aunſwere
pleaſed greatly the lordes of Fraunce. Thus
the duke and they were louingly togyder / and
the duke gaue them a great dyner and ſupper / 
and after they tooke their leaue / and the duke
retourned to Burdeaux and the frenche men
in to Fraunce. They founde in their waye the
duke of Berrey at the cytie of Poyeters / and
they ſhewed hym what they had doone. The
duke of Berrey thought the duke of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
anſwere reaſonable / and ſo dyd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frenche
kynge and the duke of Burgoyne / and ſo the
mater abode ſtyll in this eſtate. And for this
cauſe quod ſir Iohan Graily the duke of Lan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>caſtre
hath ſent hyther in to Englande of his
counſayle / as ſyr Wylliam Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that ſhall be Mary maudelyn daye / but what
ſhalbe done as yet I knowe nat. But as I am
enfourmed of ſome englyſſhe men that knowe

of the opynion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his brother the duke
of Lancaſtre ſhulde abyde ſtyll in Guyen / ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to retourue agayne in to Englande / 
bycauſe he was ſo great with the kynge. for I
enſure you this duke of Glouceſtre is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylous

he wolde rule all hym ſelfe / and he is ſo
beloued of the comynalte / that what ſo euer he
ſaythe they wyll enclyne to him. He cauſed the

of the kynges counſayle to dye for hatred and
yuell wyll / durynge the ſeaſone that the duke
<pb n="ccliiii" facs="tcp:22067:268"/>
of Lancaſtre was beyonde the ſee in Caſtyle.
He is more dred in Englande than beloued.</p>
            <p>NOwe lette this mater paſſe quod ſyr
Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Graily / and I ſhall ſhewe you
nowe the ſeconde buſyneſſe that the
kynge hathe to do / as I am enfourmed. The
kynges pleaſure is to be remaryed / and hath
ſertched ouer all for a wyfe. if the duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>goyne
or the erle of Haynalte had any dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to mary / the kynge wolde gladly haue had
one of them / but they haue none / but ſuche as
be maryed. It hath ben ſhewed the kyng that
the kynge of Nauarre hath bothe ſuffers and
doughters / but he wyll nat entende y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wayes.
The duke of Glouceſtre hath a doughter able
to mary he wolde gladly that the kyng ſhulde
haue had her / but the kynge wolde nat / for he
ſaid ſhe was to nere of his kynne / for ſhe is his
coſyn germayne. The kynge enclyneth moſte
his mynde to the Frenche kynges doughter / 
wherof all the countrey hath great marueyle
that he wolde take his enemyes doughter. the
kynge is nat the beſte beloued Prince of the
worlde with his people / but he ſetteth lytell
therby. he ſheweth always how he had rather
haue warre with any other realme than with
Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / wherfore he wolde haue a good peace
bytwene the frenche kynge and hym and their
realmes / for the kynge wyll often tymes ſaye
that the warre hath endured to longe bytwene
them / and that many valyaunt men are deed
therby on bothe parties / wherby the chriſten
faythe is ſore mynyſſhed and febled. And it is
nat pleaſaunt to the realme of Englande that
he ſhulde mary with Fraunce / and it hath ben
ſhewed hym that the doughter of Fraunce is
ouer yonge / and that this fyue or ſyxe yere ſhe
ſhall nat be able to kepe hym company. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he hath aunſwered and ſaythe / that ſhe ſhall
growe ryght well in age / and though he faſte
a ſeaſon he ſhall take it well a worth / and ſhall
ordre her in the meane ſeaſon at his pleaſure / 
and after the maner of Englande / ſayenge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
howe he is yet yonge ynough to abyde tyll
the lady be of age. No man canne breke the
kynge out of this purpoſe / and or ye departe / 
ye ſhall here moche of this matter. And thus
for theſe cauſes the kynge rydeth nowe to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham.</p>
            <p>THus this gentle knyght ſyr Iohan of

knight was capytayn of Bouteuyle / baſtarde

I herde his wordes gladly and dyd put them
in memory. And all the way bytwene Leades

and with ſyr Wylliam Lyſle. Thus the
kynge came to Eltham on a tueſday / and on
the wednyſday the lordes of all coſtes began

And I aunſwered I wolde ſo do. Well quod
the knyght / one (as me thought was offyciall
of Burdeaux) ſpake for all his partie / and firſt
ſhewed forthe his procutacyon and auctorite / 
to the entent he myght the better be beleued /

Burdeaux / and the cyties of Bayon and Dax
and all the ſygnories and lorſhyppes that be
appendaunt to the lymyttes of the ſayd coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys

fro the demayns of the crowne of Englande / 
nor to gyue or alyenate them / to chylde / vncle /

and to veryfie this we ſay that the aboue

Wherfore ryght dere ſyr and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

you to conſydre all theſe poyntes and artycles

Therwith this offyciall helde his peace / and
the prelates and lordes eche of them regarded

to the kynge fyrſte his two vncles / and
the erles of Derby and Arundell. Than they
of Acquytayne were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to departe
tyll they were called agayne. They departed
and alſo the two knightes that were come thy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
fro the duke of Lancaſtre. Than the kyng
demaunded counſayle what ſhulde be done / 
and what aunſwere ſhulde be made. The pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lates
tourned the aunſwere to the kynges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles / 
bycauſe the mater touched them rather
than any other. At the fyrſt they excuſed them
ſayeng they myght nat well aunſwere / for the
mater was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune / and ought to be debated
by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune counſayle / and nat by lygnage nor
fauour. Thus they bode a good ſpace / but fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
the aunſwere was layde on the duke of
Glouceſtre / and he was prayed and requyred
to ſaye his aduyſe. Than he aunſwered and
ſayde / howe it was a herde thynge to take a

in their corage / that the aunſwere was nat rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſonable / 
but they durſte nat ſaye agaynſt it / 
the duke of Glouceſtre was ſo ſore dred / and
the erle of Derby ſonne to the duke of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
was there preſente / who furthered thoſe
wordes and ſayde. Fayre vncle ye haue well
ſayd / I am of your opinyon. Therwith the
counſayle began to breke / and ſome murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
one with another / and they of Guyen nor
yet the duke of Lancaſters knightes were nat
called agayne at that tyme. Whan the kynge
ſawe all the mater he dyſſimuled a lytell / and
it was his entenſyon that they ſhulde aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
togyther agayne in counſayle after dyner / 
to ſe if any other propre way myght be taken
for the honoure of the crowne of Englande.
Than the kynge cauſed the byſſhop of Caun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury
to ſpeke of that he had gyuen hym in
charge in the mornynge to ſpeke of / that was
<pb facs="tcp:22067:270"/>
vpon the ſtate of his maryage / and to ſende in

the Erle Marſhall / the lorde Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde / 
the lorde Hughe Spenſer / the lorde

doughter Iſabell / of eyght yere of age / and
yet ſhe was all redy promyſed to the duke of

this myght be broken / for the Frenche kynge
and his vncles hadde ſealed with the duke of
Bretayne / yet for all that thenglyſſhe ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
had their charge gyuen vnto them / 
and ſo they departed out of Englande and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryued
at Calays / &amp; there taryed a fyue dayes / 
and than departed in great araye / and tooke
the waye to Amyence / and they ſente before
Marche the haraulde / who had brought to

beſyde that the lorde Moncheuerell was ſette
to be their guyde / and to ſe them ſerued of all
thynges neceſſary. ¶Nowe we ſhall leaue to
ſpeke of them and retourne to our fyrſte pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>NOwe as I haue ſhewed you before / 
the counſaylours of the Cyties and
good townes of Acquytayne / prayed
the kynge and his counſayle / to whome they
were boude / to mayntayn their lyberties and
fraunches / as in the demayne of the Crowne
of Englande / as he was ſworne to do / affer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge
that ſurely they wolde kepe their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyente
lyberties / and wyll nat breke it for no
maner of cauſe or condycion / and in holdynge
thus their opynyon / foure partes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle
and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune voyce of the countrey / re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>puted
theym for valyaunt and worthy men.
But the duke of Glouceſtre was of another
opinyon / for he wolde that his brother the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
of Lancaſtre <abbr>ſhuld</abbr> haue bydden ſtyll in Ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quytayne / 
for he thought he was ouer great
in Englande / and to nere the kynge / as for his
brother the duke of yorke he cared nat / for the
duke of yorke was a prince that loued his eaſe
and lytell buſyneſſe. Alſo he had a fayre lady
to his wyfe / doughter to the erle of Kent / on
whome was all his pleaſure. But the duke of
Glouceſtre was ſubtyle / and euer demaunded
ſomwhat of his nephue kynge Rycharde / yet
he was but poore / for all that he was a great
lorde and conſtable of Englande / and erle of
Hertforde &amp; of Perces / and of Bokyngham / 
and alſo he had yerely out of the kynges co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
foure thouſande nobles / and neuer rode
on the kinges buſyneſſe nor for the realme one
daye / without he knewe why and wherfore.
For theſe cauſes he was nat indyfferent / for
the maters of Acquytayne / for he wolde haue
had his brother of Lancaſtre to haue bydden
ſtill in Acquitayn for euer / for than he thought
he wolde haue ſhyfted well ynoughe in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande.
As ſoone as he had ſayd his ſentence
(as ye haue herde before) and that he ſawe
ſome murmured in the kynges chambre / and
that the prelates and lordes talked togyther
two and two / he iſſued out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chambre / and
the erle of Derby with hym / and came in to
the hall at E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tham / and made a clothe to be
layde on a table and ſo ſate / downe to dynner / 
and lefte all other ſtyll talkynge togyther.
Whan the duke of yorke knewe that he was at
dyner / he went to kepe hym company. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dyner whiche he made ſhorte / the duke of
Glouceſtre dyſſymuled the mater / and tooke
his leaue of the Kynge ſyttynge at the table / 
and ſo departed and toke his horſe and rode
to London / and the erle of Derby abode ſtyll
with the lordes that daye and the nexte daye.
Thus they of Acquytayne coulde haue none
expedicyon nor delyueraunce.</p>
            <p>I Haue delyght to write this mater at
length / bycauſe to enfourme you of
the trouthe / for I that am auctour of
this hyſtory was preſente in all theſe maters / 
and this valyaunt knyght ſyr Rycharde Su<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye
ſhewed me euery thynge. And ſo it was
that on the ſonday folowynge all ſuche as had
ben there were departed / and all their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaylours / 
except the duke of yorke / who abode
ſtyll about the kynge / and the lorde Thomas
Percy and ſyr Rycharde Sury ſhewed my
buſyneſſe to the kynge. Than the kynge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred
to ſe my booke that I had brought for
hym. So he ſawe it in his chambre / for I had
layde it there redy on his bedde. Whanne the
Kynge opened it / it pleaſed hym well / for it
was fayre enlumyned and written / and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with crymſon veluet / with ten botons of
<pb n="cclvi" facs="tcp:22067:270"/>
ſyluer and gylte / and Roſes of golde in the
myddes with two great clapſes gylte / ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chely
wrought. Than the kyng demaunded
me wherof it treated / and I ſhewed hym / 
howe it treated of maters of loue / wherof the
kynge was gladde and loked in it / and reed
it in many places / for he coulde ſpeke and
rede Frenche very well. And he tooke it to a
knyght of his chambre named ſir Rycharde
Creadon / to beare it in to his ſecrete cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre.
And the ſame ſonday I fell in acquayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce
with a Squyer of Englande called
Henry Caſtyde / an honeſt man and a wyſe / 
and coude well ſpeke Frenche. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyed
with me / bicauſe he ſawe the kyng and other
lordes made me good chere / and alſo he had
ſene the boke that I gaue to the kynge. Alſo
ſir Richarde Sury had ſhewed hym howe
I was a maker of hyſtories. Than he ſayd
to me as here after foloweth.

knyghtes and .xxx. thouſande archers / well
payde wekely / that euery manne was well
pleaſed. but I ſhewe you / bycauſe ye ſhulde
knowe the tronthe. Irelande is one of the y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
countreis of the worlde to make warre
vpon / or to bring vnder ſubiection. For it is
cloſed ſtrongely and wyldely with highe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes
and great waters and mareſſhes / and
places inhabytable. It is harde to entre to
do them of the countrey any do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage / nor ye
ſhall fynde no towne nor perſone to ſpeke w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

And whan they ſe their tyme / they wyll ſone

The kyng my ſoueraygne lordes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was / that in maner / countenaunce / and
apparell of clothyng / they ſhulde vſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
to the maner of Englande / for the kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
thought to make them all four knyghtes
they had a fayre houſe to lodge in in Duue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn / 
and I was charged to abyde ſtyll with
them and nat to departe. And ſo two or thre
dayes I ſuffred them to do as they lyſt / and
ſayde nothynge to them / but folowed their
owne appetytes. They wolde ſytte at the ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
and make cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenaunce nother good nor
fayre. Than I thought I ſhulde cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to chaunge that maner. They wolde cauſe
their myſtrelles / their ſeruauntes / and var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes / 
to ſytte with them and to eate in their
owne dyſſhe / and to drinke of their cuppes.
And they ſhewed me / that the vſage of their
countre was good / for they ſayd / in all thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
(except their beddes) they were and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men. So the fourthe day I orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
other tables to be couered in the hall / af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſage of Englande. And I made theſe
four kynges to ſytte at the hyghe table / and
there mynſtrels at another borde / and their
ſeruantes and varlettes at another byneth
them / wherof by ſemynge they were diſplea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed / 
and behelde eche other &amp; wolde nat care / 
and ſayd / howe I wolde take fro them their good
vſage / wherin they hadde been noriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
Than I anſwered them ſmylyng to a
peace theym / that it was nat honourable for
their eſtates to do as they dyde before / and
that they muſt leaue it / and vſe the cuſtom of
Englande / and that it was the kynges plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
they ſhulde ſo do / and how he was char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged
ſo to order them. Whan they harde that
they ſuffred it / bycauſe they had putte them
ſelfe vnder the obeyſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the kyng of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande / 
and parceuered in the ſame as long
as I was with them. yet they hadde one vſe
whiche I knewe well was vſed in their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tre / 
and that was they dyde were no breches
I cauſed breches of lynen clothe to be made
for them. Whyle I was with them I cauſed
them to leaue many rude thynges / aſwell in
clothyng as in other cauſes. Moche ado I
had at the fyrſt to cauſe them to weare gow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of ſylke furred with Myneuere &amp; gray / 
For before theſe kynges thought them ſelfe
well apparelled whan they hadde on a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.
They rode alwayes without ſadelles &amp;
ſtyropes / and with great payne I made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to ryde after our vſage. Andon a tyme I de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their beleue / wherwith they
were nat content / and ſayd / howe they bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
on god and on the trynite / aſwell as we.
Than I demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on what pope was their
affection The aunſwered me on hym of Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me.
Than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e I demaunded if they wolde nat
gladly receyue the order of knyghthode / and
<pb facs="tcp:22067:272"/>
that the kyng of Englande ſhulde make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
knyghtes / accordynge to the vſage of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and Englande / and other countreis. they
aunſwered howe they were knyghtes all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye / 
and that ſuffyced for theym. I aſked
where they were made knyghtes / and howe
and whan. They anſwered / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the age of ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyn
yere they were made knyghtes in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande / 
And that a kynge maketh his ſonne a
knyght. and if the ſonne haue no father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyue / 
than the nexte of his blode maye make
hym knyght. And than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e this yonge knyght
ſhall begyn to iuſte with ſmall ſpeares / ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
as they maye beare with their caſe / and
rynne agaynſt a ſhelde / ſette on a ſtake in the
felde / and the more ſpeares that he breaketh / 
the more he ſhalbe honoured. I knewe their
maner well ynough / though I dyde demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
it. But than I ſayd / that the knighthode
that they had taken in their youthe / ſuffyced
nat to the kynge of Englande. But I ſayde
he ſhulde gyue theym after another maner.
They demaunded howe. I aunſwered / that
it ſhulde be in the holy churche / whiche was
the mooſt worthyeſt place. Than they encly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
ſomewhat to my wordes. Within two
dayes after the erle of Ormonde came to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
who coude right well ſpeke the langage / for
ſome of his landes laye in thoſe parties. He
was ſente to them by the kynge and his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle.
They all honoured hym and he them.
Than he fell in ſwete communycacion with
them / and he demaunded of them howe they
lyked me. They aunſwered and ſayde / well
for he hath well ſhewed vs the vſage of this
countrey / wherfore we ought to thanke him / 
and ſo we do. This aunſwere pleaſed well
the erle of Ormonde. Than he entred lytell
and lytell to ſpeke of the order of chiualry / 
whiche the kyng wolde they ſhulde receyue
He ſhewed it them fro poynt to poynt / howe
they ſhulde behaue them ſelfe / and what par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teygned
to knyghthode. The erles wordes
pleaſed moche theſe four kynges / whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

kynge of Thomonde. The thyrde Arthure
of Mackequemur kynge of Lynſter. The

They were made knightes by kyng Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of Englande in the Cathedrall churche of
Duuelyn / dedycate of ſaynt Iohan Baptyſt
It was done on our lady day in Marche / as
than it fell on a Thurſday. Theſe four kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
watched all the night before in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che / 
and the nexte daye at highe maſſe tyme / 
with great ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnyte they were made knigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes / 
and with them ſir Thomas Orphen / ſir
Ioatas Pado / and ſir Iohan Pado his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyn.
Theſe kynges ſate that day at the table
with kyng Rycharde. They were regarded
of many folkes / bicauſe there behauyng was
ſtraunge to the maner of Englande / and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
countreis / and euer naturally men deſyre
to ſe newelties. Than I ſir Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Froiſſart
ſayde. Henry / I beleue you well: &amp; I wolde
it had coſt me largely that I had been there.
And ſurely this yere paſt I hadde come hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and it hadde nat been / for that I herde of
the dethe of quene Anne of Englande / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
dyde lette me. But one thynge I wolde
deſyre of you to knowe / howe theſe four kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
of Irelande came ſo ſoone to the kynge
of Englandes obeyſaunce / whan kynge Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
the kynges graunfather / who was ſo

coude neuer ſubdue them nor putte them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der / 
and yet he had alwayes warre with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
and in that they are ſubdued nowe / ye ſayd it
was by treatie / and by the grace of god. In
dede the grace of god is good / who ſo can ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue

a dayes / that erthely princes getteth lytell w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
it be by puiſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. I deſyre to know this
for whan I ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e in to Heynalt / of which

whiche cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey the ſayd duke and his

but the Freſons wolde neuer fall to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon / 
nor come vnder obeyſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / nor as yet do

Chriſtall &amp; ſayd. Sir Iohan / to ſhewe you
the very trouth I can nat / but as many a one
ſaythe / &amp; it is to ſuppoſe / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the great puiſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the kyng had ouer with him / and taryed
there in their countrey nyne monethes / and
euery man well payed / abaſſhed the yriſſhe
men. Alſo the ſee was cloſed fro them on all
<pb n="cclviii" facs="tcp:22067:272"/>
partes / wherby their lyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges and marchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes
myght nat entre in to their countreys / 
thoughe they that dwell farre within the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme
cared lytell for it (for they knowe natte
what marchaundyſe meaneth / nor they lyue
but groſely and rudely like vnto beeſtes) yet
ſuche as lyueth on the marcheſſe of England
and by the See cooſt / vſe feate of marchaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyſe
with vs / and in to other places. Kynge
Edwarde of noble memorie in his tyme / had
to anſwere ſo many warres / what in Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
Bretayne / Gaſcone / and Scotlande / ſo that
his people were deuyded in dyuers places / 
&amp; ſore occupyed / wherfore he coude nat ſende
no great nombre in to Irelande. But whan
the Iryſſhmen ſawe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great nombre of men
of warre that kyng Rycharde hadde in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande
this laſte iourney / The yriſſhmen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſed
them ſelfe and came to obeyſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And
in dede / of olde tyme there was a kyng in En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
named Edwarde / who is a ſaynt and
canonyſed / and honoured through all this re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>alme.
In his tyme he ſubdued the Danes / &amp;
diſconfyted them by batayle on the See thre
tymes. And this ſaint Edwarde kyng of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande / 
lorde of Irelande and of Acquitayn
the yriſſhmen loued and dredde hym moche
more / than any other kyng of Englande that
had been before. And therfore our ſouerayne
lorde kyng Richarde / this yere paſt / whan he
was in Irelande / in all his armories and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyſes / 
he lefte the beryng of the armes of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande / 
as the lybardes &amp; flour delyces quar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terly / 
and bare the armes of this ſaynt Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde / 
that is a croſſe patent golde and gou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les
with four white martenettes in the felde / 
wherof it was ſaid / the yriſſhmen were well
pleaſed / and the ſoner they enclyned to hym / 
For of trouthe / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> predeceſſours of theſe four
kynges obeyed with faithe and homage to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſayd kyng Edwarde / and they repute kynge
Richarde a good man and of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience
and ſo they haue done to hym faithe &amp; homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge / 
as they ought to do: and in like maner as
their predeceſſours ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyme dyde to ſaynt Ed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde.
Thus I haue ſhewed you the maner
how the kyng our ſouerayne lorde hath this
yere accomplyſſhed and furnyſſhed his voy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>age
in Ireland: put it in your memoriall / to
the entent / that whan ye ſhall retourne in to
your owne countrey / ye may write it in your
cronicle / with many other hyſtories that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende
to the ſame matter. Than I thanked
hym / and ſayd it ſhulde be done. So I toke
leaue of hym. Than I mette with Marche
the heraulde / and I demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of hym what
armes this Henry Chriſtell bare / and I ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the heraulde / howe this ſir Henry had
ſhewed me the maner of the kynges torney
in Irelande / and the ſtate of the foure kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / 
who had ben (as he ſayd) in his gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng / 
more than fyftene dayes at Duuelyn.
The heraulde anſwered me and ſayd. Sir / 
he beareth in his armes Syluer / a cheuerne
goules / thre beſans goules. All theſe thyngꝭ
I dyde putte in writynge / bycauſe I wolde
nat forgette them.</p>
            <p>THus I taryed in the kynge of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glandes
courte / as longe as it plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
me / nat always in one place / for
the kynge often tymes remoued / to Eltham / 
to Ledes / to Kyngſtone / to Shene / to Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſey / 
or to Wyndſore / aboute the marcheſſe of
London. And I was enformed of a trouthe
that the kyng wrote to his vncle the duke of
Lancaſtre / for they of Acquitayne ſpedde ſo
in their buſyneſſe / that their countrey abode
ſtyll to the crowne of Englande. Than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e it
was concluded by generall counſayle of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande / 
that the gyfte that the kynge hadde
gyuen to the duke of Lancaſtre / muſt nedes
abyde ſtyll as his owne: howe be it the duke
of Glouceſtre wolde that his brother myght
haue enioyed the kynges gyfte / but his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
coulde nat be herde in that caſe / For they
of the Realme of Englande (bycauſe of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and caſualtyes in tyme to come) herde
well the wordes of theym of Burdeaux and
of Bayone. And conſydred well / that yf the
herytage of Acquitaygne were putte fro the
Crowne of Englande / it ſhulde be in tyme
to come a great preiudice to the realme / whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
they wolde in no wiſe ſhulde fortune / for
alwayes Burdeux &amp; Bayon / and the fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters
and marches of Gaſcon / had kept &amp; augmen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
greatly / the honour of the realme of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande.
Theſe thyngꝭ were well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſydred of
the wyſe men of the kynges cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke
of Glouceſtre abſent / for before hym no man
durſt ſpeke. ſo the mater abode in this caſe.
¶We ſhall leaue of this matter / and ſpeke
of the kynge of Englandes ambaſſadours:
as the erle of Rutlande and therle marſhall / 
<pb facs="tcp:22067:273"/>

of Tyrouer: They were a fyue hundred hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
The Frenche kynge was lodged at the
caſtell of Lour / and the quene and her chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at the houſe of ſaynt Poule / vpon the ry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
of Seyne. The duke of Berrey at the

in his owne houſe / the duke of Orlyau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / the

at their owne houſes. The kynge had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
there all his counſayle / to the entent to
make the better anſwere to thembaſſadours
of Englande. The kyng had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce / 
for their ſmall expences / and for their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
And the chiefe of theſe Englyſſhe lordes
as the erle Marſhall and therle of Rutla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
were often tymes with the kynge and dyned
with hym. they had as good there as coulde
be deuyſed / for the loue of the kynge of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de.
Theſe lordes deſyred euer to haue an

fayre wordes. For the noble men of Fraunce
had great marueyle of the requeſtes of the
Englyſſhe men. And that the kynge of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande
wolde marry with Fraunce / ſeynge
that the warre had ben ſo cruell / and ſo long
endured. And ſome of the Frenche kynges
counſayle ſayd / howe maye our kyng agree

He was a farre caſtyng man / and conſydred

ſeynge that by reaſon of maryage / he

and it pleaſe god and my lorde my father that
I ſhall be quene of Englande / I ſhall be glad

Ambaſſadours / and they ſayd amonge them
ſelfe / that ſhe was lykely to be a lady of hygh
honoure and great goodneſſe. Thus whan
theſe lordes of Englande had ben at Parys a
twenty dayes / and their coſtes and charges
payed for by the frenche kynge / a reaſonable
aunſwere was gyuen them / ſo that they were
put in great hope to bringe aboute that they
came for / howe be it the frenche men ſayd / it
coulde nat be doone ſhortly / bycauſe the lady
was ſo yonge / and alſo ſhe was fyanſed to the
duke of Bretayns eldeſt ſonne / wherfore they
ſayd they muſt treat to breke that promeſſe / or
they coude procede any further in that mater / 
and thervpon the frenche kynge and his coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayle
ſhulde ſende into Englande the next lent
after / to ſhewe howe the matter wente. And
whan the dayes begyn to encreace and waxe
fayre / Than the kynge of Englande to ſende
agayne in to Fraunce whome it ſhulde pleaſe
hym / and they ſhulde be welcome. With this
aunſwere the englyſſhe men were contented
and toke leaue of the quene and of her dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / 
and of the kynge / and of all other / and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
fro Paris and toke the ſame way they
came and ſo retourned to Calays / and than
in to Englande. and the two erles rode in poſt
before their company / to bringe tydynges to
the kyng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they rode fro Sandwiche to Wynd
ſore in leſſe thanne a daye and an halfe. The
kynge was ryght ioyouſe of their comynge / 
and was well contente with the frenche kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
aunſwere. He ſet the mater ſo to his herte
that he toke great pleaſure therin / and tooke
hede to none other thynge / but ſtudyed howe
he myght bringe it aboute to haue the frenche
kinges doughter to wyfe.</p>
            <p>ON the otherſyde the Frenche kynge
and his counſayle ſtudyed daye and
nyght / howe they myght make this
maryage with Englande to the honour of the
realme of Fraunce. There were many in the
realme of Fraunce that ſayd / that if they had
been called to theſe treatyes / and our wordes
herde / the kynge of Englande ſhulde neuer
haue the doughter of Fraunce / for any maner
of peace. What good ſhulde it be for Fraunce / 
ſeynge the trewce bytwene them endured but
for two yere to come / and than ſhall we fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
in warre / and eche of vs hate other as
we haue doone before? The dukes of Berrey
and Orlyance were of the ſame opynion / and
dyuers other lordes of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But the king / 
the duke of Burgoyne / and the chauncellour
of Fraunce / enclyned to this maryage / and
gladde to haue peace / reſeruyng alwayes the
honour of the Realme. The ſame tyme there
was a ſquier in Fraunce of the nacyon of Nor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandy
in the countrey of Caulx / he had in his
dayes ben ſore traueyled in farre parties / and
as than he was newly retourned into Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / 
his name was Robert le menuot / but as than
he was called Robert the Hermyte / he was re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lygyous
and of good lyfe / of the age of fyfty
yere / he had been at the treaties that was
holden at Balyngham / at whiche
tyme he was well herde / and
howe he entred than in
to that treatie I

Than as he that was nothynge abaſſhed / re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed

Whan he had doone he departed. Than

thought it good to aduyſe the kynge to ioyne
this Robert in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myſſion with them to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
to Balyngham to the treatie of peace / 
for they thought his langage ſo fayre and ſo
ſwete / that he ſhulde ſtyrre the hartes of them
that ſhulde here hym ſpeke / to haue peace / and
to ſhewe the deuyne vyſion that he had / to the
lordes of Englande. This they thought law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ynough to be done / and the nexte day they
ſhewed this to the king. And than after whan
the duke and the chauncellour wente agayne
to Balyngham / they had this Roberte with
them. And whan all the lordes frenche and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glyſſhe
were aſſembled togyder in counſayle / 
than this Robert came before them / and there
well and wiſely he declared all the vyſion that
he hadde on the ſee / and affermed that it was
inſpyracyon deuyne ſente by god / bycauſe he
wolde it ſhulde be ſo. Some of the lordes of
Englande toke good hede to this mater and
enclyned therto / as the duke of Lancaſtre / the
erle of Salyſbury / the lorde Thomas Percy
and other / the byſſhops of Lyncolne and Lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don / 
but the duke of Glouceſtre and the erle of
Arundell / toke no hede nor ſet nothynge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
Whan they were in their lodgynges they
ſayd / they were but fantaſies / and wordes fay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
by the frenchmen to abuſe them all / howe
be it they determyned to write to kynge Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde
the maner and ſayenge of this Robert
the Hermyte / and thervpon ſent a knyght cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Rycharde Credon to kynge Rychardeꝭ
who he founde in Kent / at the caſtell of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / 
and delyuered him letters ſent fro his am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baſſadours
in the marches of Calays / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was conteyned the hole ſayenge of this Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bert.
The kynge tooke great pleaſure in theſe
letters / and ſayd howe he wolde gladly ſpeke
with this Robert the hermyte / he beleued this
vyſion to be of trouthe. Than the kyng wrote
agayne to the duke of Lancaſtre and to the
erle of Salyſbury / that if it myght be by any
meanes / that a good peace myght be taken by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene
hym and the frenche kynge / their real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
and alyes / for he ſayde ſurely he thought
that the warre had ouerlonge endured / and
that it was tyme to haue peace. And ye haue
<abbr>herd</abbr> here before howe the treaters bare them / 
and how the lordes departed one fro another / 
and howe the treuce was taken to endure for
foure yere. This was the entent of the lordes
of the englyſſh party / except the duke of Glou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſtre / 
for he thought whan ſo euer he came in
to Englande / neuer to agree to any peace by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
Fraunce and Englande. He dyſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
as moche as he might / to thentent to pleaſe
the king and his brother of Lancaſtre. Thus
by this meanes Roberte le Hermyte came to
knowledge.</p>
            <p>ANd as ye haue herde here before / how
the erle of Rutlande / therle Marſhall / 
the archebyſſhop of Dunelyn / the lorde Hugh
Spenſer / the lorde Lewes Clyfforde and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / 
had been ſent in to Fraunce to treate for
kynge Rychardes maryage / and were retour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
agayne in to Englande / and brought the
kynge good tydynges / ſo that the kynge was
well pleaſed / as ye haue herde before. Than
Mychelmas came / and the generall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle
began / ſuche as englyſſhe men call the terme / 
wherin all maters be debated / and at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge
of the ſayd terme the duke of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtre
returned out of Gaſcon in to Englande
and had nat ben receyued there / as he thought
he ſhulde haue been (as ye haue herde before)
So whan the duke of Lancaſtre was retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned / 
the kyng made hym good chere. Tydin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
anone came in to Fraunce howe the duke
of Lancaſtre was retourned in to Englande.
than the frenche kynge and his counſayle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyned
to ſende Robert the Hermyte into
Englande with letters to the kynge / who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred
to ſe hym / and that the erle of ſaynt Poll
ſhulde acquaynte hym with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng and with
the lordes / that they myght here hym ſpeake
of the buſyneſſe of Surey and Tartary / and
of the greate Turke and Turkey / where he
had ben longe / for it was thought that the lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of Englande wolde gladly here ſpeakyng
of ſuche maters. Than this Robert the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myte
was warned to make hym redy to go in
to Englande in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myſſion / wherof he greatly
reioyſed / bycauſe he had neuer been there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:22067:275"/>
So he had letters delyuered hym / dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to the kyng of Englande and to his vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles.
Thus Robert departed fro Parys with
ſeuen horſes at the coſt and charge of the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
kynge / and rode tyll he came to Boloyne / 
and there tooke the ſee and aryued at Douer / 
and ſpedde ſo in his iourneys that he came to
Eltham and founde the kynge there / and the
Duke of Lancaſtre / the erles of Salyſbury / 
and Huntyngdon / &amp; the lorde Thomas Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy / 
and for the honour of the frenche kynge he
was well receyued / and ſpecyally of the kynge
who deſyred greatly to ſe hym. Than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered
his letters of credence / whiche were
redde ouer by the kynge and the other lordes.
The duke of Glouceſtre was nat the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he was
in Eſſex / at a Caſtell of his called Plaſſhey.
Whan this Robert had been with the kynge
and with the duke of Lancaſtre at Eltham a
fyue daies he departed thens to goſe the duke
of Glouceſtre / and ſo toke leaue of the kynge
and of the lordes and came to London / and
the next day rode fyftene myle fro London to
a towne called Brendwode / and the next day
to Plaſſhey / and there he founde the duke and
the Ducheſſe / and their chyldren / who ryght
goodly receyued hym acordyng to his degre.
Than Robert delyuered hym his letters ſent
fro the frenche kyng. And whan the duke ſawe
they were of credence / he drewe this Robert a
parte / and demaunded what credence he had.
Robert aunſwered hym and ſayd / ſyr I ſhall
ſhewe therin to you at good leyſer / I am nat
come to departe agayne ſo ſoone. Well quod
the duke ye be welcome. This Robert knewe
well ynough that the duke of Glouceſtre was
a ſore dyſlymulynge prince / and contrary to
any peace / and thought it harde to breke hym
fro his opinyon / for he knewe well he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
contrary to the peace / whiche was well
ſene at the treaties at Balyngham / for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
demaunded but to haue warre. yet for all
that Robert the Hermyte ſpared nat to ſpeke
to the duke on the forme of peace. Alwayes he
founde the duke colde in aunſwers / and ſayd
the mater lay nat in hym / for he had two elder
bretherne / the duke of Lancaſtre and the duke
of yorke / to whome the mater partayned ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to hym / and alſo that if he wolde con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent
therto alone / peraduenture the other lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / 
prelates / and counſaylours of good tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / 
wolde nat accepte it. Well quod Robert
the Hermyte / for the loue of our lorde Iheſu
Chriſt be ye nat contrarye to the peace / for ye
maye do moche / and alſo ye ſe well howe the
kyng your nephue enclyneth to the peace / and
wyll by maryage haue the Frenche kynges
doughter / by whiche coniunctyon ſhalbe gret
alyaunce of peace and loue. Than the duke
aunſwered and ſayd. What though ye be bele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
and herde at this tyme / with the kynges
and lordes of bothe realmes / and that ye haue
good audye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with them and with their coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaylours /

you / and often tymes I haue ſaid that I ſhall
neuer be contrary to the peace / ſo it be to the

aſſembled them togyther and entred in to

            <p>The concluſyon of the warre and hate by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene

whan he herde of his good ſpede / in any
of his entreprices. The duke of Bretaygne
who was a ſubtyle prince and ymaginatyfe
and had endured moche payne duryng this

of Naples and of Hieruſalem. Alſo the duke
ſawe that he began to waxe olde / &amp; that his
chyldren were but yonge / and ꝑceyued well
he had no frendes in Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / except the duke
of Burgoyne &amp; the duches his wyfe. And he

for by their mothers ſyde / they came &amp; were

kynge Charles of Nauerre father to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe
of Bretayne had done / in tyme paſt in
Fraunce / wherof the remembraunce as than
endured. And the duke ſawe that if he dyed
in that eſtate / bothe with ſir Olyuer of Cliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and with the erle of Ponthieur / he than
douted that his chyldren that were ſo yonge
ſhulde haue ouer many great enemyes. and
alſo he ſawe that the alyaunce bytwene hym
and Englande began to waxe colde / For he
was enformed that the kynge of Englande
ſhulde haue to wyfe the doughter of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
theſame lady that was promyſed to hym for
his ſonne and heyre. The duke dyde caſt all

he ymagined to breke his herte without
diſſimulacion / and make a ferme peace with
ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon &amp; with Iohan of Bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne:
And wolde putte hym ſelfe at their

forfaytes / and do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mages / that euer they dyde
to hym or to his men / duryng the warre. He
wolde deſyre nothynge but that they ſhulde
take hym for duke of Bretayne / and his chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren
after hym / accordyng to the artycles of
the peace before made / bytwene hym and the
chyldren of ſir Charles of Bloyes / whiche
charter of peace he wolde nat breke nor any

He called to hym his ſecratorie and in a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre

I do ſende the to ſpeke with my coſyn ſir O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer

to the caſtell Ioſſelyn. The porters had mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueyle
whan they herde hym ſaye that he cae
fro the duke of ſpeke with their maiſter. they
wente and ſhewed their lorde therof. Than
he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that the meſſanger ſhulde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
to hym / and ſo he dyde. And well and wiſely
declared his meſſage / and delyuered his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſealed with the dukes ſeale / whiche ſir O<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyuer
knewe ryght well / and opyned &amp; reed
the letter two or thre tymes / the better to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande
it. And in the redyng he had great
marueyle of the ſwete wordes / cretable / and
amyable / that was compriſed in the letter.
He ſtudyed a ſeaſon / and at laſt ſayd / howe
he wolde take aduyſe and write agayne. ſir
Olyuers men hadde great marueyle of this / 
for before he had forborne no man of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes / 
but outher he was ſlayne or putte in pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſone.
Than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e ſir Olyuer wente in to his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
chambre / and began to muſe and yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn
vpon theſe newes: At laſt he apeſed his
yuell wyll / in that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke humyled hymſelfe
ſo moche towardes him / and that he wrote ſo
ſwetely. yet he thought in hym ſelfe to proue
the duke further / or he aduentured hym ſelfe
to go to the duke / for he thought if he toke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hurte / no man wolde bewayle hym / if he
loſt hym ſelfe by folly. Than he wrote a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the duke ryght ſwete and tretable / but
the concluſyon was / that yf he wolde haue
hym to come &amp; ſpeke with hym / that he ſhuld
ſende his ſon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e and heyre to lye in hoſtage for
hym / tyll his retourne. This letter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered
to the dukes varlet / who retourned
therwith to Wannes where the duke was / &amp;
there delyuered his letter. The duke reed it / 
and ſtudyed a lytell and ſayd. I ſhall do it / 
to the entence to treate louyngly with hym.
Than the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> duke wrote a letter to the vycount
of Rohan / who was at the caſtell of Cayre / 
Whan the vycount ſawe the dukes letter / he
came incontynent to Wannes. Than the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
ſhewed all his purpoſe and entencyon. &amp;
ſayd Vycount / you and the lorde of Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſier
ſhall leade my ſon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to the caſtell Ioſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelyn
and leaue hym there / and bringe with
you the lorde Olyuer Clyſſon / for I wyll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and make peace with hym. The vicou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
ſayd it ſhulde be done gladly. So they toke
the dukes ſonne and heyre / who was about
the age of eight yere / and ledde hym to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
Ioſſelyn / to the lorde Olyuer Clyſſon / 
who receyued them ryght honorably. And
whan he ſawe the chylde and the good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the duke / he humyled and apeſed his
herte greatlye: and with that the knyghtes
tolde hym and ſayd. ſir / ye ſe the good wyll

I ſhall yelde me vnder his obeyſaunce. And
it ſemeth ye be ryght nere to hym / ſeynge he
putteth his affiaunce and truſt in you / to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer
you his heyre to bringe to me to lye in

lordes anſwered and ſaid. Sir / he hath well
tolde vs / that he hath ryght great deſyre to
come to a peace and accorde with you. In
this ye maye right well beleue vs / we be of
your blode. Than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e ſir Olyuer went for the
letters that the duke had ſent hym / and reed
them. Sir quod they / all that is conteyned
in this letter he hath ſaid vnto vs / and vpon
the ſame eſtate he hath ſent vs hyder. Than
ſir Olyuer ordaygned hym to departe with
the ſayd lordes / and toke the dukes ſonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
with them and ſaid / howe they ſhulde
bringe agayne the chylde to his father / ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
that he truſted right well his ꝓmyſe / co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydring
that he had proued hym ſo farre / and
<pb n="cclxiii" facs="tcp:22067:277"/>
that he had ſhewed ſuche humilyte: He dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nat but that his herte was in vnyte. So
they came to Wannes. The duke had apoyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
that ſir Olyuer ſhulde tary at a Freres
without the towne of Wannes / and there the
duke ſhulde come and ſpeke with hym: as it
was ordayned ſo it was done. and whan the
duke ſawe that ſir Olyuer had brought aga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yne
his ſonne and heyre / he reputed if for a
great curteſy / and was well content therw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
Thus the duke and ſir Olyuer mette in the

were farre of fro all people / they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned a

were I knowe nat / but their dealynge was
as I ſhall ſhewe you.</p>
            <p>THeir men had went they hadde been
ſtyll in the Freres / but as it was ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
me / they were thus in the ſhyppe more
than two houres / &amp; there made a good peace
bytwene them / and ſware faythe and trouth
eche to other without diſſymulacyon. Than
they called agayne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boteman / &amp; he brought
them agayne where he had them / and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
agayne by the gardeyne ſyde in to the
Freres. Than anone after the duke ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e out
and ledde ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hande
and ſo went in to the towne of Wannes / and
in to the caſtell called le Mote. Of this pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
euery man was greatly reioyſed / and to ſe

mete for hym / at the duke of Orlyaunce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce / 
the lorde of Coucy with thre hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred

Some lordes of the genowayes ſuche as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured

They had many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munycacyons in the felde

he ſignyfied his eſtate to the duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyance / 
whervpon he was remaunded and ſo
he retourned to Parys / and came thyder the

Than the lorde of Coucy ſaid / my lorde &amp; you

            <p>THeſe lordes prepared them ſelues to

her buſyneſſe. She was a lady of great co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage / 
ſhe pleted in parlyament for two cauſes.
The fyrſt was for the herytage of the countie
of Rouſſey agaynſt the Erle of Brayne / for
Loys the duke of Aniou her lorde &amp; huſbande
had bought it and payed for it / to a lady that
was cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teſſe of Rouſſey / ſomtyme wyfe to the

and Iheruſalem her huſbande / whiche money
was delyuered hym to haue payed in to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well / 
and or it was payed he herde howe his

he iourneyed no further / but returned agayne
in to Fraunce / and kept ſtyll the ſayd ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of
money to his owne profyte / and neuer made
acompte to the ſayde quene therof / nor to her
chyldren Loys and Charles / but ſpente and
waſted the money in pride and bobbans. The
quene layde to his charge that for faute of pay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
of the ſayd money / the realme of Napo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
was loſte and conquered by Margarete
of Duras / and by the heyres of the lorde Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les
de la Paix / by reaſon that ſuche ſoudyours
as her huſbande had to mayntayne his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
in Puell &amp; Calabre / were nat payed their
wages / wherby many tourned to the Erle of
ſaynt Seuyre and to Margarete of Duras / 
and other departed and lefte the warres. All
theſe cauſes were put in to the Parlyament
chambre at Parys / where all cauſes were pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed / 
ſhewed and demaunded / and all the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fences
and aunſweres herde on all partyes.
Their plee had endured the ſpace of thre ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
And though ſyr Peter of Craon were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

for the good ſeruyce that he had done to him.
This plee had endured ſo longe that it was
neceſſary to haue a concluſyon / and the lady
made importunate ſewte to haue iudgement.
The lordes of the parlyament conſydred all
thynges / and ſayd they wolde gyue no iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment / 
without both parties were preſent / and
ſyr Peter of Craon durſte nat well apere in

all other charges / and lordes &amp; ladyes made
hym good chere / I wote nat whether it were
by diſſymulacyon or otherwyſe. thus he was
agayne at Parys / holdynge as great eſtate

the englyſſhe ambaſſadours to the kynge / for
he was a knyght that hadde ſene moche / and
knewe moche honoure. Than the daye was
prefyxed that the iudgement concernynge the
quenes maters ſhulde be determyned / at whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
day there were preſent in the parlyament / 
great nombre of the lordes of Fraunce / to the

Berrey / Burgoyne / and Burhone / and the
erle of Brayne / and the byſſhoppe of Laon.
And before theym the lady was herde to laye
her tytell for the countie of Rouſſey. And on
the other parte there was ſyr Peter of Craon
and many of his lygnage. Fyrſte iudgement
was gyuen for the countye of Rouſſey / and

ordayned to gyue the ſeconde ſentence aroſe

the ſomme of a hundred thouſande frankes in
redy money / or els his body to go to pryſone
tyll ſhe were contented and ſatyſfyed. Of this
iudgement the ſayde lady thanked the lordes

The Kynge and other of his opynyon were

The duke of yorke paſſed it ouer lyghtly

The duke of Glouceſtre was of a nother

There the erle of Neuers was made knight

knightes enclyned. than two hundred of them
that were beſt horſed rode forthe / and the reſt
who were an eyght hundred / enbuſſhed them
ſelfe couertly in the wode / and there taryed.
The other rode forthe / and came to the place
where the turkes were. Whan they ſawe the
cryſten men come / they were ryght ioyouſe / 
wenynge there had been no mo / and ſo came
out of their holdes in to the playne feldes. and
whan the cryſten men ſawe tyme they turned
and fled / and made the turkes to chaſe them.
They were ſo well horſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the turkes coulde
nat ouertake them / and they chaſed ſo longe
that they paſſed the wode where as the enbuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhement

the cryſten men iſſued out / and cryed our lady
be with the lorde of Coucy / and ſo daſſhed in

turkes helde them cloſe togyther / whan they
ſawe how they were beſet before and behynde
and dyd put them ſelfe to defence as well as
they myght / but they kept none ordre / for they
were nat ware of the reregarde. And whan

were abaſſhed. The Frenche men dyd quyte

Than tydynges ran ouer all the hooſt

ſayenge that with an handefull of men

ſpake thoſe wordes by enuy / that he had to the

of the voyage that the erle of Haynalt and the

nouther he / nor all the lordes that were there

make but one iourney. That is well ſaid quod
the duke of Burgoyne / for than at youre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne /

Than theſe ſayd knyghtes and eſquyers
of Haynalt without any contradictyon acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to his deſyre / promyſinge to do hym ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce
as his trewe ſubgiettes / whiche they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fylled
in dede and dyligently prepared for the
ſame / ſo that by the begynnyng of the moneth
of Auguſt / in the yere of our lorde god a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
thre hundred fourſcore and ſyxtene / they
were all redy aparelled and aſſembled by com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panies
at Anners / there to take the water / and
fro thence to Encuſe / where the hole aſſemble
ſhulde mete. ¶Nowe whyle this aſſemble
was thus made in Haynalte / it were to be
demaunded if the ladyes and gentle women
and other / were ioyouſe of this iourney? We
ought to ſay naye / for than they ſawe their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers / 
their bretherne / their vncles / their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes / 
and their louers and frendes departe
to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> peryllous warre. for ſome of them knewe
well / howe that in tyme paſte the haynoways
wente with their lorde in to Freſe / and neuer
retourned agayne / wherfore they feared leſte
it ſhulde hap ſo than to theſe / as it dyd on their
predeceſſours. The ducheſſe of Brabant had
defended all men in the countrey of Brabant / 
no man to be ſo hardy to go oute of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
in that iourney. The ladyes and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
of Haynalt deſyred often tymes their
frendes and louers to leaue that iourney / but
they coulde nat lette the mater / howe be it they
were ſore diſpleaſed in their myndes with the
baſterde of Vertayne Fierebraſe / for they ſaid
he was one of the chyefe ſetters on of that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyneſſe.
Thus after that the duke Aubert and
Guillyam his ſonne had herde the aunſwere
of his men of Haynalte / than he went in to ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande / 
ſhewynge them his buſyneſſe. and they
aſſented to his requeſt / by the chiefe ſettynge
on of the lorde de la Vere / and ſyr Floris de
Boeſell / Floris / Dabell / the lorde of zenem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brige / 
ſyr Clays de Boyſell / Phylyp Corteen
and dyuers other gentlemen. All theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made them ſelfes redy / in ſuche wyſe that
it apered well by their dylygence / that they
had great deſyre to auaunce them ſelfe to that
iourney.</p>
            <p>IN lyke wyſe the duke and his ſonne
went in to Holande and made there
lyke requeſtes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lordes and good
townes / as they had done in zelande. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
were therof ryght ioyouſe / for of all
men they hated the freſons / for they were euer
at warre togyther ſpecyally on the ſee and on
the borders of their countrey / and therfore the
lordes of Holande / ſuche as the lorde Tarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell / 
and dyuers other noble men knyghtes
and ſquyers / herynge the requeſtes of their
lordes duke Aubert and the erle of Oſtrenant
they offered themſelfe / promyſynge comforte
and ayde to the beſt of their powers / and that
they well ſhewed / for incontynent they made
them redy / and auaunced forwarde. In lyke
wiſe dyd the men of the good townes and of
<pb n="cclxxiiii" facs="tcp:22067:288"/>
the countrey. They ſent forthe with theſe lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
a great nombre of croſbowes and moriſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pykes / 
and other men of warre. So daylye
men aſembled at the towne of Encuiſe / and
ſhyppes and veſſelles came thyder / in ſuche
wyſe / that the maryners were eſtemed to the
nombre of .xxx. thouſande. It was ſayd that
there came out of the towne of Harle .xii. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred / 
whiche ſhyppes were well prouyded
of all thynges neceſſary. And of a trouthe / 
if the ladyes and other damoſelles were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roufull
in Heynalt / in lykewiſe ſo were they
of Hollande and zelande. Sir Danyell of
Marebbed and Guillyam of Oruenbourge
they durſt nat apere before the ladyes &amp; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylwomen / 
for they had ſore ſette forwarde
the buſyneſſe / for they hadde great wyll and
deſyre to be reuenged of the Freſons / bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
of a batayle that hadde been there before / 
wherin the Erle Wyllyam was pituouſlye
ſlayne / and loſt .xxxiii. cotes of armes of his
lynage / wherfore theſe two knyghtes wolde
neuer take any treſon to mercy nor rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſome.
So within a certayne ſpace euery man was
come to Encuiſe. Fyrſt came the Englyſſhe
men and than the henous / and their capyten
was the ſeneſchall of Iumont and the lorde
of Comegynes / who was marſhall. Than
came hollanders and zelanders. The fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che
men came nat ſo ſoone. So they taryed a .xi.
dayes for the Frenche men / in whiche ſeaſon
there fell a debate bytwent the hollanders &amp;
the Englyſſhe men / and if the erle of Oſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt
had nat ben / all the Englyſſhmen had
ben ſlayne. Whiche ſtryfe was apeſed &amp; than
the frenchmen came. Than there was great
ioye made / and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement gyuen / that
euery man ſhulde entre in to ſuche ſhyppes / 
as they were aſſygned vnto before / whiche
was done. And whan they were all ſhypped
they hoyſed vp ſayles and ſayled forthe. the
wether was fayre / it ſemed as it was diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pleaſure. There were ſo many
ſhippes that if they had be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> araynged one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another / they wolde haue ſtretched fro en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſe
to the boundes of Condren / whiche was
in highe Freſe / where they purpoſed to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryue
(as they dyde) whiche was .xii. leages
by water / but they ſayled a front right ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly.
¶Nowe wyll we leaue ſpekyng of
them and ſpeke of the Freſons / who (as I
was enformed) were aduertyſed long before
of duke Aubertes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng / with great puyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunce
on them.</p>
            <p>WHan the freſons knewe and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtode
that they ſhulde haue warre / 
all the wyſe men of the countre aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
toguyder / to take counſayle and aduyſe
what they ſhulde do. Whan they had long de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bated
the mater / their ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion was to fyght
with their enemyes / as ſoone as they myght
knowe that they were entred in to their coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey / 
ſayeng howe they had rather dye as fre

or prince / or vnder ſubiectyon. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſayd / to dye in the quarell they wol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
fight with their enemyes. And concluded
amonge themſelfes / to take no man to raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome / 
howe great ſoeuer he were. Amonge
them there was one man farre excedynge in
greatneſſe aboue all other. He was hygher
than any other man in that countrey by the
heed. He was called Iuye Iouer / and ſome
called hym the great Freſone. This manne
was greatly commended in Pruce / in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery / 
in Turkey / in Rodes / and in Cypres.
He hadde done many noble feates of armes / 
ſo that he was greatlye renomed. Whan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e he
harde the opynions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Freſons / howe they
wolde fight with their enemyes / he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and ſayde. ¶O / ye noble and free Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons /

ſoone made agayne if we ſhulde fight with
them. I feare me we be nat ſtronge ynough
to fyght with them at ones / for as I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed / 
they be to the nombre of an hundred
thouſande armed heedes. Whiche was of a
trouthe / they were as many or mo. To his
wordes conſented thre other knightes of the
Freſons / the fyrſt named ſir Fewe of Dore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerque / 
the ſeconde ſir Gerarde of Canym / 
and the thirde ſir Tiny of Walturge / but the
people wolde in no wyſe conſente to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſe / 
no more wolde other noble men called
the Elyns / that is to ſaye / the gentylmen or
iudges of the cauſes. They replyed ſo with
this great freſon / that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded with
them / that as ſoone as they knewe their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes
entred in to their countre / they ſhulde
go and fyght with them. They abode all on
that opinyon / and ſo made them ſelfe redy.
But to ſaye the trouthe / they were but poore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
armed. Many had no armure / but their
cootes of wadmoll / and courſe groſe clothe.
Some armed with lether / and ſome with ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtye
mayle: and ſome there were ryght well
armed.</p>
            <p>THus they armed theym / and whan
they were redy they wente to their
churches and toke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſes and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners /

ten thouſande fyghting men / &amp; came to

ſawe well howe their enemyes were come / &amp;
had great deſyre to take lande / whiche was

a woman apparelled all in blewe / who all in

Than ſome lepte out of the ſhippes in to the

their ſwerdes and ouertoke her / and hewed

freſons / who receyued them right valyantly
and putte them of with longe pykes &amp; longe
ſtaues bounde with yron. To ſaye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trouthe
in takyng of lande there was many dedes of

and ſore hurte. But biforce of the Engliſſhe
archers and croſ bowes of Heynaulte / Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande /

and certayne tentes reyred vp. There
they reſted them that ſondaye / and the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye
aduiſynge the Freſons their enemyes / 
In whiche two dayes dyuers ſcrymiſſhes
were made / and on the Tueſday bothe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were redy. Than certayne newe knigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
were made / and it was ordayned to fight

ſowned trumpettes and clarions / and ſo ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e

freſons came to defende the paſſage / and the
archers ſhotte agaynſt them fierſly / and the
freſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s couered them ſelfes with targes / and
with the erthe of the dyke that was bytwene
them &amp; their enemyes: Howe be it they were
ſo nere aproched / that certayne of the holan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
entred in to the dyke and made bridges
with ſperes and pykes / and ſo with valyant
corage began to enuade the freſons / who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
their force right valyantly / and gaue
ſuche ſtrokes againſt them that wolde mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

downe agayne: But the Heynowayes / 
Frenche men / Englyſſhe men / Hollanders / 
and zelanders were ſo well armed / that the
freſons coude do them no do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage nor hurt / 
but caſt them downe to the grounde. There
<pb n="cclxxv" facs="tcp:22067:289"/>
were ſuche noble dedes done and atchyued / 
that it were impoſſible to ſhewe it. the newe
made knyghtes dyde nobly their deuoyre / &amp;
the Freſons defended marueylouſly. They
were great and bygge men / but they were y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
armed: many were barelegged and bare
foted. In this aſſaut the lorde Lygne / the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſhall
of Heynault / and the lorde Iumont / 
and dyuers other / as they wente aboute this
dyke / They founde awaye wherby they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ouer the dyke / and ſo came on the freſons
with the poyntes of their ſperes / wherof the
Freſons were fore abaſſhed / ſo that dyuers
of them lepte the dyke. So perforce the Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were fayne to opyn and ſparcle abrode
here and there. In this batayle the great fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon
was ſlayne and the other began to flye.
The chaſe was horryble and cruell / for none

ſlewe all they myght attayne vnto / 
In ſo moche that ſuche as were taken by the
Heynowes / frenche men / or Englyſſhe men
the hollanders ſlewe them in their handes.
Amonge the hollanders / the lorde Wyllyam
of Oruenbourge and his two ſonnes / Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and Henry (who were made knyghtes the
ſame mornyng) acquyted themſelfe maruey
louſly well / and ſlewe many Freſons / for it
ſemed well by them / that they loued but litell
the freſons. Thus finally the Freſons were
diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fyted / and the mooſt parte ſlayne in the
felde / but fewe were takenne priſoners / and
caryed to Haye in Hollande / and there were
kepte a long ſeaſon after. The lorde of Cun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren
(who was lorde of that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey / where
the felde was) was the mondaye before yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to the duke Aubert and his two ſonnes / 
and yet for all that they were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> felde with
the freſons. The two ſonnes were longe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke. After this diſconfyture they
entred in to the countrey of Condren / &amp; toke
townes and fortreſſes / howe be it they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
but lytell / for the Freſons dyde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great
do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage by preuy encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trynges. And whan
they ſhulde take any priſoners / they wolde
neuer yelde / but fought to the dethe: ſayeng
they had rather dye free Freſons / than to be
vnder the ſubiectyon of any prince or lorde.
If any priſoners were taken / there coude no
raunſome be gotten for them / for their fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
wolde nat quyte them out / but rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fre
them to dye in priſone. They wolde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
quyte none of their people / withoute it
were to delyuer man for man. And if they
ſawe that there were none of their people in
priſone / they wolde ſlee all their enemyes &amp;
take no priſoner. Thus about the ende of .v.
wekes / and that the heynous and other had
taken and beaten downe certayne townes / 
vyllages / and fortreſſes / of no great valure.
The leaſon beganne to waxe colde maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly / 
and rayned nereha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de euery day / and
the ſees full of tempeſtes and wyndes. The

If it were nat the truſte that we haue in

the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teſſe of Neuers / the
counteſſe of ſaynt Poule / and the
other lordes and ladyes of Fraunce / hadde
greatly feeſted the lordes and ladyes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande / 
than there was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municacion howe

thervpon apoyntment was made / and leaue
taken on all partes. The Englyſſhe ꝑtie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to Calis to the kyng / &amp; ſhewed what
chere they had / and what preſentes had ben

kyng / for he was gladde whan he herde any
honour ſpoken of the Frenche kyng / he was
ſo in loue with hym bycauſe of his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / 
whome he truſted to haue to his Quene.
Than anone after the Frenche kyng came to
ſaynt Omers / and was lodged in the abbey
of ſaynt Bertyne / and diſlodged all other
that were there before / and had the duke of
Bretayne in his company. And than it was
ordayned that the dukes of Berrey / of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne /

to ſpeke with the kynge of Englande.</p>
            <p>SO they came to Calays / and were
ioyouſlye receyued / &amp; had as good
chere as coulde be deuyſed. Theſe
thre dukes had ſecrete communycacion with
the kynge and his counſayle / ſo that many / 
bothe of Fraunce and of Englande reputed
that there was a peace concluded bytwene
Fraunce and Englande. And in dede it was
nere at a poynt / and the duke of Glouceſter
agreed well therto / as at that tyme. For the
kyng of Englande hadde promyſed hym / if
he wolde agree to the peace / to gyue his ſon
Affren the erldome of Rocheſter in herytau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce / 
and to make hym ſpende yerely in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
two thouſande pounde ſterlyng / and
to gyue to hym ſelfe as ſoone as he came in
Englande in redy money fyftie thouſande
nobles / ſo that by reaſon of theſe gyftes / the
duke of Glouceſtours hardneſſe was well
aleyed. So that the lordes of Fraunce ſawe
well his opinyons were nat ſo obſtynate as
they were before / for they founde hym than
ſwete and meke. Whan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e euery thynge was
ordeygned of that they came for / they tooke
leaue of the kynge and other / and retourned
to ſaynt Omers to the Frenche kynge / and
ſhewed howe they hadde ſpedde. Than the
Frenche kyng wente to the baſtyde of Arde
and the duke of Burgoyne to Mountoyre / 
and the duke of Bretaygne to the towne of
Eſque / and the duke of Berrey to Balyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.
And in euery ꝑte all aboute there were
pyght vp Tentes and Pauilyons / and all
the countrey full of people / what of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and of Englande. The kynge of Englande
came to Guyſnes and the duke of Lancaſtre
with hym / and the duke of Glouceſtre to Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes.
Thus on a Fridaye beyng the euyn of
Symon and Iude / in the yere of oure lorde
god / a thouſande thre hundred fourſcore and
ſixtene / about tenne of the clocke in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone.
The two Kynges departed oute of
their tentes / the which were pyght nat farre
aſondre / and came a foote the one to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other
and met at a certayne place that was apoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And on the one ſyde there was arayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
four hundred knyghtes of Fraunce / ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with their ſwerdes in their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / And
on the other parte foure hundred Englyſſhe
knyghtes in lyke maner. So the two kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
paſſed through them. The dukes of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>caſtre
and of Glouceſtre ledde the Frenche
kynge / and the dukes of Berrey and of Bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>goyne
ledde the kynge of Englande. Thus
they came foreby the ſayd eight hundred kni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ghtes.
And whan the two kynges came iuſt
toguyder / all the eyght hundred knyghtes
kneled downe to the grounde / and many of
them wepte for ioye. Thus the two kynges
mette toguyder bareheeded / and a lytell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned
and tooke eche other by the handes.
Than the Frenche kynge ledde the kynge of
Englande in to his tente / whiche was noble
and ryche / and the four dukes tooke eche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the handes and folowed the two kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges.
And other knyghtes after the Frenche
men on the one ſyde / and the Englyſſhe men
on the other ſyde: And ſo they ſtode regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
eche other in good and humble maner
tyll all was done. Than<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e it was ordayned / 
that on the ſame place where as the two kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
tooke eche other by the hande / that there
ſhulde be made and founded a chapell in the
honoure of our Lady / and ſhulde be called
our lady of Grace. I can nat tell whether it

and the other to Calais. The Frenche kyng
rode to Cordre and the duke of Orlyaunce
with hym / the duke of Berrey to Dornam / 
and the duke of Burgoyne to Mountoyre.
So there was no more done that daye / all

            <p>THeſe or lyke wordes ſayd the kynge
of Hungery to the lordes of Fraunce
&amp; rekened Nycopoly as their owne / 
howe be it fortune fell otherwyſe. All that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the kynge Baſaach called Lamorabaquy
had reyſed an army of ſarazyns / ſome out of
farre countreys / as out of Perce. many great
men of the ſarazyns came to ayde Lamoraba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quy
to dyſtroy cryſtendome. They were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Braſe ſaynt George to the nombre of

the chryſten men were nat a certayned what
nombre they were of. This kynge Baſaache
and his men aproched nere to Nycopoly by
couerte wayes / they knewe in feates of warre
as moche as myght be / and this kynge was a
valyaunt man / whiche ſhewed well by reaſon
of his polycy / he ordered his bataylles thus.
All his hooſt was in a maner as wynges / his
men compriſed well a great myle of grounde / 
and before the hooſt to ſhewe a face redye in
a bande an eyght thouſande turkes / the two
wynges of the batayle were open a forefronte
<pb facs="tcp:22067:292"/>
and narowe <abbr>behynde</abbr>/and Lamorabaquy was
in the herte of the batayle / thus they rode all
in couerte. Theſe eyght thouſande Turkes
were ordeyned to make a face / and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as ſone
as they ſhulde ſe the cryſten men a ꝓche / than
they to recule lytell and lytell in to the herte of
the batayle / and than the two wynges whiche
were open before (the cryſten men beyng ones
entred bytwene theym) to cloſe togyther and
ioyne in to one company / and than to fyght
with their enemyes. This was the ordre of
their batayle.</p>
            <p>THus in the yere of oure lorde god a

the turkes were comyng and the ſcoutes that
came in ſhewed howe they had ſene the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes /

tydynges was brought to the erle of Neuers / 
and to all other ingenerall by their ſcurers /

you. Theſe tydynges greatly reioyſed the cry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſten
men / ſuche as deſyred to do dedes of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
Than euery man roſe fro their dynners
and put the tables fro them / and demaunded
for their harneſſe and horſes / and they were
well chafed before with drynkynge of wyne.
Than euery man drewe in to the felde / baners
and ſtanderdes dyſplayed / euery man to his
owne baner. Than the baner of our lady was
dyſplayed / therwith the valyaunt knyght ſir
Iohan of Vien admyrall of Fraunce / and the
frenche men were the fyrſt that drewe in to the
felde freſſhely aparelled / makynge ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte
of the turkes / but they knewe nat that
they were ſo great a nombre as they were / nor
that Lamorabaquy was there in his owne
perſone. As theſe lordes of Fraunce were into
the felde / there came vnto theym the kynge of
Hungeryes marſhall in great haſt / who was
a valyaunte knyght / called Henry of Oſten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lenyhall / 
vpon a good horſe with a penon of
his armes / of ſyluer a croſſe ſable ancored / cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in armure / the yron of a mylſtone. Whan
he came before the baner of our lady he ſtode
ſtyll / and (to the moſte parte of the barones of
Fraunce) he ſayd openly. Syrs I am ſent hy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther

deſireth you by me / that ye ſat nat on your ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myes
vntyll ſuche tyme as ye haue worde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne

our ſcoutes haue nat brought the certaynte of
the nombre of the turkes / but within theſe two
houres ye ſhall here other tydynges / for we
haue ſent other foreryders forth to auewe our
enemyes more ſubſtancially than the firſt dyd
and ſyrs ye maye be ſure the turkes ſhall nat
indomage vs / if ye tary tyll all our hole puyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunce

the kynge and his counſayle hath ordered / I
muſte retourne agayne to the kynge. Whan he
was deꝑted the french lordes aſſembled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyder / 
to knowe what was beſt for them to do.
Than it was demaunded of the lorde Coucy
what he thought beſt to be done / he anſwered
and ſaid. I wolde counſayle to obey the kyng
of Hungeryes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement / for that ordre
ſemeth to be good. And as it was enfourmed
me ſyr Phylippe of Arthoys erle of Ewe and
conſtable of Fraunce / was nat contented that
the aduyſe had nat fyrſt haue ben demaunded
of hym. Than he for pride and diſpyght helde
the contrary opynyon / and ſayd. ye ſyr ye / the
kynge of Hungery wolde haue the floure and
chiefe honour of this iourney / we haue the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde / 
he hath graunted it to vs / and nowe he
wolde take it fro vs agayne / beleue hym who
wyll for I do nat / &amp; than he ſayd to the knyght
that bare his banner / in the name of god and
ſaynt George / ye ſhall ſeme this daye a good
knyght. Whan the lorde Coucy herde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
ſpeke theſe wordes / he toke it done of a

beſt to be doone. Syr quod he where as wyſe

we ſhulde be the ſtronger and if our puyſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

wynges eche of .lx. thouſande men beganne
<pb n="cclxxviii" facs="tcp:22067:292"/>
to aproche and to cloſe / and had the chryſten
men bytwene them / ſo that if they wolde haue
reculed they coulde nat / for they were cloſed in
with the ſarazyns / the wynges were ſo thicke.
Than dyuers knyghtes that were well expert
in armes / ſawe well the iourney ſhulde be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt

knight ſyr Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Vien. Euery knyght
of Fraunce was in his cote armure that euery
man ſemed to be a kinge / they were ſo freſſhly
aparelled. As it was ſhewed me whan they be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gan
fyrſte to fyght with the turkes / they were
nat paſt a ſeuen hundred men. Lo beholde the
great foly and outrage / for if they had taryed
for the kynge of Hungery who were threſcore
thouſande men / they had been lykely to haue
doone a great acte / and by them and by their
pride all was loſt / and they receyued ſuche do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mage / 
that ſythe the batayle of Rounſeualx / 
where as the .xii. peres of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce were ſlayne
cryſtendome receyued nat ſo great a do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage
howe be it or they were dyſcomfyted a great
nombre of turkes were ſlayne / for the frenche
men dyſcomfyted the fyrſt batayle of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes / 
and had them in chaſe tyll they came in to
a valey / where Lamorabaquy was with his
hole puyſſaunce. Than the frenchmen wolde
haue retourned to their hooſt / but they coulde
nat / for they were cloſed in on all partes. there
was a ſore batayle / the frenche men endured
longe. Than newes came to the kyng of Hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gery
howe the frenche men / englyſſhmen / and
almayns were fyghtyng with the turkes / and
had broken his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement and counſayle
gyuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his marſhall / wherwith he was
ſore dyſpleaſed / and nat without good cauſe.
Than he ſawe well howe he was lykely to leſe
that iourney / Than he ſaid to the great may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Rodes / who was by hym. Syr we
ſhall this day leſe the iourney by reaſon of the
pride of the frenchmen / for if they wolde haue
beleued me / we had been ſtronge ynough to
haue fought with our enemyes. and therwith
the kynge of Hungerye loked behynde hym / 
and ſawe howe his men fled a waye and were
diſcomfyted in them ſelfe. Than he ſawe well
there was no recouery / and ſuche as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute
hym cryed and ſayd. Saue your ſelfe / 
for if ye be ſlayne all Hungery is loſte / ye ſhall
leſe the felde this daye / by reaſon of the pride
of the frenche men / their valyau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tneſſe turneth
to folyſſh hardynes / for they ſhall be all ſlayne
or taken / none is lykely to ſcape / therfore ſyr if
ye beleue vs ſaue youre ſelfe / and ſcape this
daunger.</p>
            <p>THe kynge of Hungery was ſore dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
whan he ſawe howe he had
loſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iourney by dyſorderyng of the
frenche men / and ſawe no remedy but to flye
or els be taken or ſlayne. Great murder there
was / for in flyenge they were chaſed and ſo
ſlayne. They of Hungery fledde without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre / 
and the turkes chaſed theym / howe be it
god ayded the kinge of Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gery and the great
mayſter of the Rodes / for they came to the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of Dunce / and founde there a lytell barge
parteynynge to the Rodes / they entered in to
it but with ſeuen perſones / and ſo went of the
ſhore / or els they had been ſlayne or taken / for
the turkes came to the Ryuer ſyde / and there
ſlewe many a cryſten man / ſuche as had folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the kynge to ſaue them ſelfe.</p>
            <p>NOwe lette vs ſpeke of the frenche men
and almayns who fought valyauntly.
Whan the lorde of Mount caurell a ryght va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyaunt
knyght of Arthoys ſawe that the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfyture
ranne vpon them / he had by hym a
ſonne of his a yonge man / than he ſayde to a
ſquyer of his. Take here my ſonne and leade
hym away by yonder wynge whiche is open
and ſaue hym / &amp; I wyll abyde the aduenture
with other of my felowes. Whan the chylde
herde his father ſay ſo / he ſayd howe he wolde
nat departe / but the father dyd ſo moche that
perforce the ſquyer led hym away out of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
and came to the ryuer of Dunce / but there
the chylde had ſuche care for his father that he
tooke ſmall regarde to hym ſelfe / ſo that he fell
in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ryuer bytwene two barges / and there
was drowned without remedy. Alſo ſyr Wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyam
of Tremoyle fought in that batayle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyauntly / 
and there was ſlayne and his ſonne
by him / and ſyr Iohan of Vyen bearynge the
baner of our lady was ſlayne / and the baner
in his handes. Thus all the lordes and knigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that were there were diſtroyed / 
by the maner / as ye haue herde. Syr Iohan
of Burgoyne erle of Neuers / was ſo rychely
beſene / and in lykewyſe ſo was ſyr Guy de la
Ryuer / and dyuers other lordes and knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of Burgoyne / that they were taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb facs="tcp:22067:293"/>
And there were two ſquiers of Picardy
ryght valyaunt men / called Gyllyam Dewe / 
and the Bourge of Maytequell / theſe two by
valyauntneſſe two tymes paſſed through the
felde / and euer retourned in agayne and dyd
marueyls / but fynally ſhere they were ſlayne.
To ſay the trouthe the frenche men and other
ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers that were there acquyted them ſelfe
valyauntly / but the frenchmens pride loſt all.
There was a knyght of Pycardy called ſyr
Iaques of Helley / who had dwelte before in
Turkey / and had ſerued Lamorabaquy / and
coude ſomwhat ſpeke the langage of Turkey
whan he ſawe the batayle loſte he yelded hym
ſelfe / and the Sarazyns who are couetous of
golde and ſyluer toke and ſaued hym. Alſo a
lquyer of Tornaſys called Iaques du Fay / 
who had before ſerued the kynge of Tartary
called Tauburyn / as ſoone as this Iaques
knewe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the frenche men came to make warre
in Turkey / he toke leaue of the kynge of Tar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tary
and departed / and was on the ſayd felde / 
and taken priſoner by the kyng of Tartaries
men / who were there in the ayde of Lamora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baquy / 
for kynge Tauburyn of Tartary had
ſent to hym great nombre of men of warre.</p>
            <p>THe frenchmen were ſo richely arayed
that they ſemed lyke kynges / wherby
they were taken and their lyues ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued / 
for ſarazyns &amp; turkes are couetous / they
truſted to haue great raunſomes of theſe that
were taken / and reputed them greater lordes
than they were. Sir Iohan of Burgoyn erle
of Neuers was taken priſoner. In lykewyſe
were the erles of Ewe and de la Marche / the
lorde Coucy / ſyr Henry of Bare / ſyr Guy de
la Tremoyle / Bouciquant and dyuers other.
And ſyr Philyp of Bare / ſyr Iohan of Vyen / 
Willyam of Tremoyle and his ſonne ſlayne / 
and dyuers other. This batayle endured thre
houres fyghtynge / and the kinge of Hungery
loſt all his baggage and all his plate and io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles / 
and was gladde to ſaue hym ſelfe / but
with ſeuen perſons with him in a lytell barge
of the Rodes / els he had been taken or ſlayne
without recouery. There were mo men
ſlayne in the chaſe than in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle / 
and many drowned / 
happy was he that might
ſcape by any maner
of meanes.</p>
            <p>WHan this dyſcomfyture was doone
and paſſed / and that the turkes ſuche
as were ſent thyder by the Sowdan
were withdrawen in to their lodginges / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
was in to tentes and pauylyons that they
had conquered / whiche they founde well reple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyſſhed
with wyne and meate redy dreſſed / 
wherwith they refreſſhed them / and made ioy
and reuell / lyke ſuche people as had ateygned
vyctorye on their enemyes. Than Lamora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baquy
with a greate nombre of mynſtrelles
acordyng to the vſage of their countrey / came
to the kynge of Hungeryes chefe tent / whiche
was goodly aparelled and hanged with riche
ſtuffe / and there he toke great pleaſure / and
glorifyed in his herte of the wynnyng of that
iourney / and ſhanked their god acordynge to
their lawe. Than he vnarmed hym / and to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>freſſhe
hym he ſate downe on a tapyte of ſylke
and cauſed all his great lordes to come to him
to iangle and to talke with them. He made as
great myrthe as myght be / and ſayd howe he
wolde ſhortely with great puyſſaunce paſſe
in to the realme of Hungery / and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quere the
countrey / and after other countreys vpon the
cryſten men / and to bringe them to his obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunce / 
for he ſayd he was content that euery
man ſhulde lyue after their owne lawes / he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyred
nothynge but the ſignory / but he ſayd he
wolde reygne lyke Alyſaunder of Maſydone
who was twelue yere kynge of all the worlde / 
of whoſe lynage he ſayde he was dyſcended.
All y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> herde him agreed to his ſayenge. Than
he madethre co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. The fyrſt was
that who ſo euer had any priſoner cryſten / to
bringe hym forthe the ſeconde daye after in to
his preſence. the ſeconde was that all the deed
bodyes ſhulde be vyſyted and ſertched / and
ſuch as were likely to be noble men to be layde
aparte by them ſelfe in their raymentes tyll
he came thyder hym ſelfe / for he ſayd he wolde
ſe them. The thyrde was to enquyre iuſtely if
the kyng of Hungery were deed or a lyue. All
was done as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded.</p>
            <p>WHan Lamorabaquy had well refreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
hym / than to paſſe the tyme he
went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where the felde was / 
to ſe the deed bodyes / for it was ſhewed hym
that he had many of this men ſlayne / and that
the batayle had coſt hym greatly / of the which
he had great marueyle / and coulde nat byleue
<pb n="cclxxix" facs="tcp:22067:293"/>
it. Than he mounted on his horſe and a great
nombre with him / he had with hym two of his
bretherne called Baſaache and Surbaſaach / 
as ſome people ſayd / but he wolde nat be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
of them / for he ſayd he had no bretherne.
Whan he came to the place where the batayle
was / he founde it of trouthe that there were
many deed and ſlayne / he ſawe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for one cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
man deed / he founde .xxx. turkes ſlayne / 
wherwith he was marueylouſly dyſpleaſed / 
and openly ſayde. Here hath been a cruell ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle
and marueylouſſly defended of the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
men / but I ſhal make them that be a lyue
to bye it derely. Than the kynge went to his
lodgynge / and ſo paſſed that nyght in great
furour of hert / and in the mornyng or he was
vp moche people came to his tente to knowe
what they ſhulde do with the chryſten priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners / 
the renome ranne that they ſhulde all be
put to dethe without mercy. Lamorabaquy
(for all his dyſpleaſure) ordeyned that ſuche
cryſten men as were in the batayle in great a
ray / and lykely to be great men / ſhulde be all
ſette togyther in one parte / for it was ſhewed
hym that they myght well pay great raunſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
Alſo there were dyuers ſarazyns and pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyms / 
of Perce / of Tartary / of Arabye / and
ſuryens that had many priſoners / by whome
they thought to haue great aduauntage / as
they had in dede / they hyd them out of the way
ſo that they came nat to knowledge. Amonge
other ſyr Iaques of Helley was brought be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
Lamorabaquy / he that had him durſt nat
hyde hym no lenger. Syr Iaques de Helley
was beknowen with ſome of the kynges ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / 
who toke hym fro them that had him / 
whiche was happy for hym / as ye ſhall here
after / for many cryſten men were afterwarde
cruelly ſlayne and put to dethe.</p>
            <p>Kynge Baſaach had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quyre
whiche were the greateſt of the
cryſten men / and that they ſhulde be
ſet a ſyde / to the entent to ſaue their lyues. So
they were tryed out and ſet a parte. Fyrſt the
lorde Iohan of Burgoyne Erle of Neuers / 
who was chiefe aboue all other / and than ſyr
Phylyppe of Arthoys erle of Ewe / the erle of
Marche / the lorde Coucy / ſyr Henry of Bare
ſyr Guy of Tremoyle / and other to the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
of eyght perſones. And Lamorabaquy
went to ſe and to ſpeke with them / and <abbr>beheld</abbr>
them a longe ſeaſone / and he coniured theſe
lordes by their faythe and lawe / to ſaye the
trouthe / if they were the perſones that
they named them ſelfe for / and they ſayde ye.
And yet to knowe the more certaynte he ſente
to them the frenche knyght ſyr Iaques of Hel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ley / 
to knowe them / for he had ſerued Lamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabaquy
before / therfore he had his lyfe grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hym. He was demaunded if he knewe the
frenche knyghtes pryſoners. He aunſwered
and ſaid / I thynke if Iſe them I ſhall knowe
them. Than he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to go and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uewe
theym / and to ſhewe playnely their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
He dyd as he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded / and whan
he came to them / he ſhewed them his aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture / 
and howe he was ſente thyder to knowe
ſurely their names. Than they ſayde. Ah ſyr
Iaques / ye knowe vs all / and ye ſe well howe
fortune is agaynſt vs / and how we be in daun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger
of this kynge / therfore to ſaue our lyues
make vs rather greater than we be in dede / 
and ſhewe the kyng that we be ſuche men able
to pay great raunſomes. ſyrs quod he ſo ſhall
I do / for I am bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de therto. than this knight
retourned to Lamorabaquy and to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle / 
and ſyd howe thoſe knyghtes whiche
he hadde ſpoken with / were of the greateſt
men in all Fraunce / and were of the Kynges
lyngage / and ſaid they were able to pay great
raunſomes. Than Lamorabaquy ſayd howe
their lyues ſhulde be ſaued / and all other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
to be ſlayne and hewen all to peces / in
example of all other. Than the kynge ſhewed
hym ſelfe before all the people that were there
aſſembled / to whome they all made lowe reue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rence.
They made a lane for hym to paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough / 
euery man with his ſworde naked in
his hande / and ſo came thyder where the ſayd
lordes of Fraunce ſtode togyther. Than the
king wolde ſe the correction of the other / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
thynge the ſarazyns were deſyrous to do.</p>
            <p>THan they were all brought before La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morabaquy
naked in their ſhyrtes / 
and he behelde them a lytell and than
tourned fro them warde / and made a ſygne
that they <abbr>ſhuld</abbr> be all ſlayne / and ſo they were
brought through the ſarazyns / that had redy
naked ſwordes in their handes / and ſo ſlayne
and hewen all to peces without mercy. This
cruell iuſtyce dyd Lamorabaquy that daye / 
by the whiche mo than thre hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred gentlemen
<pb facs="tcp:22067:294"/>
of dyuers nacyons were tourmented &amp; ſlayne
for the loue of god / on whoſe ſoules Ieſu haue
mercy. Amonge other was ſlayne ſyr Henry
Dantoigne of Heynalt / and ſo it was the <abbr>lord</abbr>
Boucyquante marſhall of Fraunce was one

wolde that his vyctory ſhulde be

the frenche knyghtes to come before hym wher

of tho thre knyghtes he wolde choſe to ſende

Burgoyne his father. Than the erle of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
ſayd / ſyr and it pleaſe you I wolde that

with Lamorabaquy and the other two
knyghtes delyuered to dethe and ſo ſlayne / 
whiche was pytie. Than Lamorabaquy was
well apeaſed of his furoute / and vnderſtode
howe the kyng of Hungery was ſcaped away
a lyue. Than he determyned to retourne in to
Turkey to a cytie called Burſe / and ſo he dyd

that in euery place as he paſſed / to manyfeſt

had vpon the cryſten men. The Erle of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
wrote to the frenche kynge for hym ſelfe / 
and all his company / &amp; to his father the duke
of Burgoyne / and to the ducheſſe his mother.
Whan this knyght had his charge as well by

all other lordes gaue largely to this knight.
Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhewed howe he muſt nedes returne

The kynge and other thought it but

There was apoynted to go in this voyage
ſir Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Caſtell morant / who was a wyſe
knyght and well languaged. Than it was
demaunded of ſir Iaques what iowelles or
preſentes the kynge myght beſt ſende to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morabaquy / 
and that ſhulde beſt pleaſe him / 
to the entent that the priſoners ſhulde be the
better entreated. The knight anſwered / that
Lamorabaquy toke gret pleaſure in clothes

And alſo he ſayd / he had great delyte in theſe

ſayd / that fyne lynnen clothes and fyne ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes
were moche made of there / for of clothe
of golde and ſylke they hadde plentie. This
pleaſed well the Frenche kyng and the duke

            <p>WHan he deꝑted to retourne / the kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge

other two ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers were charged with
fyne ſcarlettes whyte &amp; reed. And alſo with
moche payne / the kynge gate of theſe whyte
gerfaucons. Thus ſir Iohan of Caſtell mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
departed fro Parys with his preſentes

ſhall right well recouer it. Thus the kynge
<pb n="cclxxxi" facs="tcp:22067:295"/>
bare his do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage as well as he myght. On y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
other parte / Lamorabaquy retourned in to
his countre / &amp; came to a towne called Burſe
and thyder were all the priſoners brought / &amp;
there ſette vnder ſure kepynge. They were
nothyng there at their eaſe. The heate of the
countrey and dyette ſore chaunged them / for
they hadde ben vſed before to ſwete and dely<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cate
metes and drinkes / and had their owne
cookes and offycers that dyde prepare their
meates accordynge to their dyettes: &amp; there
in Turkey they were ſarued all contrarye / 
with groſe meates / fleſſhe yuell ſodden and
dreſſed. They had ſpyces ynough / &amp; bredde
made of mylke / clene fro the nature of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
They had wyne and that was with great
daunger. Thoughe they were all great lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / 
they were but ſmally regarded there.
The turkes had as lyue they had been ſicke
as hole / and deed as a lyue. they wolde they
had ben all putte to execuſyon. So theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
conforted eche other within themſelfe
for they ſawe none other remedy. ſo ſome of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their nature chaunged and fell in to ſicke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe.
He that made the beſt chere and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynaunce
was the Erle of Neuers / and that
he dyde to conforte his companyons. alſo ſir
Bouciquant and the erle of Marche and ſir
Henry of Bare were of good conforte / and
tooke euery thynge paciently / Sayeng that
the honours in armes nor the glorie or this
worlde / coude nat be hadde without payne / 
and ſomtyme with metyng of harde aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
For they ſaid that there was neuer ſo
valyaunt and happy / that had alwayes eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thyng as they wyſſhed. They ſayde they
were bounde to thanke god that he hadde ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
their lyues / conſydringe the diſpleaſure
that Lamorabaquy and his counſayle were
in / for the loſſe of their men / for it was ones
determyned that we ſhulde all generally ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
been putte to dethe. Than Bouciquaunt
ſayd / I ought aboue all other to thanke god
of my lyfe / for I was at the poynt to haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hewen all to peces / as other of my company
were / but at the requeſt of my lorde here / the

vs fro this paryll / he wyll and it pleaſe
hym delyuer vs fro a greatter / for we be his
ſoudyers / &amp; for his ſake we haue this payne / 
For by reaſon that ſir Iaques of Helley is
gone in to Fraunce / I truſt within a yere we
ſhall haue good comforte / and be delyuered.
The matter can not abyde thus. The Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
kyng and the duke of Burgoyn wyll nat
forgette vs / but by ſome meanes / raunſomed
and delyuered.</p>
            <p>THus ſir Boucyquaunt reconforted
hym ſelfe / and tooke euery thyng in
good pacyence / but the lorde Coucy
coude take no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte / whiche was marueyle
for before that tyme he was a lorde of great
wyſdome and of great coniorte / &amp; neuer was
abaſſhed. but beyng thus in priſon in Burſe
in Turkey / he was more diſconforted than
any other / and in more malencoly / And ſayd
he was ſure he ſhulde neuer retourne in to
Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Sir Henry of Bare conforted hym
as moche as he myght / and blamed hym of
his diſconforte / ſayeng howe he ought to gy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue

ſir Henry was ſore abaſſhed in hym ſelfe / &amp;
oftentymes remembred his wyfe and wolde

Philyppe of Arthoiſe erle of Ewe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable

Than ſir Iaques right humbly ſaid to him.
Right dere &amp; redouted ſir / beholde here your

Than Lamorabaquy ſayd / thou arte welco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked

kyng and the duke of Burgoyne had ſente a
knyght of honoure embaſſade to hym with
crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / and had brought with hym certayne
preſentes of pleaſure fro the Frenche kyng.
Lamorabaquy demaunded what they were / 
and if he had ſene them or nat. The knyght
aunſwered ſir / I haue nat ſene them / but the
knyght that hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge to do the meſſage
is at Bode in Hungry. And ſir / I am come
before to ſhewe you therof / &amp; to haue a ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducte

We wyll that he haue one / as thou wylte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſe / 
wherof the knyght thanked hym. So
they departed as at that tyme. Another tyme
ſir Iaques ſpake with Lamorabaquy &amp; kne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
downe before hym and humbly requyred
that he myght ſe the lordes and knyghtes of
Fraunce / for he had dyuers thynges to ſaye
to them out of their countre. Lamorabaquy
ſtudyed a lytell or he aunſwered / and at laſte
ſayd. Thou ſhalte ſpeke with one of them / 
but with no mo / and ſo ſent for the erle of Ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers

kneled downe to hym. Therle was glad
to ſe hym / and demaunded howe the frenche
kynge and the duke his father / &amp; the duches
his mother dyde. The knyght ſhewed hym
all that he knewe / and all that he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

ſo good leyſar to talke togyder / as they wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
haue had / for Lamorabaquyes men that
were there preſent badde them haue done / for
they ſayd they had other thynges to do / than
to ſtande there and wayte vpon them. Than
ſir Iaques demaunded of the Erle howe all
the other lordes of Fraunce dyde. The Erle
ſaid they were all in good caſe / except y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde
of Coucy / who was ſomwhat diſeaſed / and
was at the cytie of Burſe. Than ſir Iaques
ſhewed hym howe ſir Iohan of Caſtell mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

to Lamorabaquy / and to aſſwage his yre / he
hath ſent hym ryche iewelles and preſentes / 
but he is at Bode in Hungry with the kyng
there / and I am come before for a ſaueco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct
for hym to come and go / the whiche Lamora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baquy
hath graunted. And I thynke I ſhall
retourne to hym ſhortely. Herof therle was
right ioyous / but he durſt make no ſemblant
for feare of the Turkes but ſaid. ſir Iaques
I vnderſtande by you / that ye are quyte of

whan ye come there / I praye you ſhewe the

to treate as ſhortely as maye be for our dely<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueraunce / 
by ſome marchauntes genowayes

for if they ſhulde make long treatie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
Lamorabaquy is trewe of his worde / cur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſſe

ſo longe by his iourneys / that he arryued at
Bode in Hungry. Than he drewe to ſir Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han

Than ſir Iaques ſayd. ſir / I haue brought

well quod the kynge / ye ſhall haue none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

went fro them and lefte the two knightꝭ ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge

with the abuſyon on the kynge of Hungery.
Than they counſayled toguyder / what was

            <p>THis meſſanger ſpedde ſo well / and

it is a thyng to humbly done for the kynge to

ſith that fortune hath ben ſo fauorable to him
to haue the vyctorie in ſuche a batayle / and
hath hadde the kyng of Hungry in chaſe and

the fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of thoſe priſoners may well fynde

Than the kyng was cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayled to write to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

gayne letters fro the frenche kynge to the kyng

their voyage into Turkey / and ſo retourned
all togyther in to Fraunce.

bycauſe his herte coude ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
loue the frenche men / therfore of the loſſe
that the frenche men had in Turkey / he was
rather gladde than ſory. The ſame ſeaſone he

for trewce / reſpyte / nor aſſuraunce / for in tyme
paſte the Frenche men haue kept no promeſſe

the herytage of the duchy of Acquytayn / 
whiche was gyuen and delyuered by agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of good treatie of peace to the kynge my

Englande / that deſyred the warre as well as
I do / and wolde put to his payne to recouer

ſo / there is no ſuche Kynge in Englande as
nowe that loueth any dedes of armes / if there

there was neuer ſo good tyme to make warre
in Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as now / for who ſoeuer goeth nowe

that englyſſhmen haue in truſt of wynnyng /

of warre that wyll deſerue to haue honour by

me of the laſt iourney y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I made into Fraunce.
I thynke I had in my company but two thou

ſayd any thyng to them / and ſo they rode into
Bretayne / and ſo a longe through the realme
of Fraunce / fro Calais to Burdeaux / without
hauynge of any batayle or rencountre. but I
thynke ſurely / who ſo wolde nowe make any
ſuche iourney they ſhulde be fought with all / 
for he that calleth hym ſelfe kynge in Fraunce
is yonge / hote / and of great corage and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe / 
he wolde ſurely fight / what ende ſo euer

for we loue nothynge ſo well as to haue ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle / 
for without it be by batayle and victory
vpon the frenche men (who be ryche) els we
ſhall haue no recouery / but ſuffre with the loſſe
as we haue done euer ſythe my nephewe was
kyng of Englande. This thyng can nat longe
endure in this eſtate / but at laſte the realme of

it / for the kyng taketh and ſhall take and reyſe
great tayles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marchauntes / wherwith they
be nat content / and yet they can nat tell where
the good becometh. Thus the kynge enpoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the realme of Englande / and gyueth to
one and other largely / and there as it is but y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
beſtowed / and his people vyeth the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne /

is of trouth.</p>
            <p>THus the duke of Glouceſtre deuyſed
with his knyght with ſuche wordes
and other / as it was well knowen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
He hated the kynge / and coulde ſpeke no
good worde of him / and though he were with
his brother the duke of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>caſtre / as one of the
greateſt rulers of the Realme / he toke no care
therof. And whan the kyng dyd ſende for him
he wolde come at his pleaſure / and ſometyme
nat a whyt. And whan he came to the kynge / 
he wolde be the laſte ſhulde come / and the firſt
that wolde departe / and in counſayle what he
had ones ſayd of his opynion / he wolde haue
it taken and accepted / els he wolde be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed / 
and ſomtyme take his leaue and departe
to his maner in Eſſex called Plaſſhey / there
was his chiefe abydynge. This duke was a
great prince / and might well ſpende by yere a
threſcore thouſande ducates / he was duke of
Glouceſtre / erle of Eſſex and of Buckingham
and conſtable of Englande. He was of ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueylous
condycyons / that the kynge douted
hym more than any other of his vncles / for in
his wordes he wolde nat ſpare nor forbeare
the kynge. The kynge alwayes was humble
and meke to hym / and whatſoeuer he wolde
demaunde the kynge wolde graunte it hym.
This duke had cauſed in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to be done
many cruell and haſty iugementes / for he had
cauſed to be beheeded withoute tytell of any
<pb facs="tcp:22067:299"/>
good reaſone that noble knyght ſyr Symon
Burle / and dyuers other of the kynges coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle.
and chaſed out of Englande the arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſhop
of yorke and the duke of Irelande / 
bycauſe they were ſo nygh of the kinges coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayle / 
and layde to their charge that they had
counſayled the kynge wronge / and ledde hym
as they lyſt / and had ſpente the reuenewes of
Englande at their pleaſures. This duke had
two bretherne / the duke of Lancaſtre and the
duke of yorke. Theſe two were euer about the
kynge / wherat this duke of Glouceſtre hadde
great enuy / &amp; wolde ſay to dyuers / as to ſuche
as he truſted (as Robert byſſhop of London
and to other / whan they came to him to Plaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhey)
Frendes / my two bretherne ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
greatly the kynges houſe / it were better
they were at home at their owne houſes. this
duke by ſubtyle couerte wayes / drewe to his
acorde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> londoners / for he thought if he might
be ſure of them / he ſhulde ſone haue all the reſt
of the realme to his acorde. This duke had a
nephue / ſonne to the doughter of his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther / 
called Lyonell duke of Clarence / whiche
doughter was maryed into Lombardy to the
ſonne of ſyr Galeas duke of Myllayne. This
duke Lyonell dyed in the cytie of Aſte in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounte.
So this duke of Glouceſtre wolde
gladly haue ſene his nephue ſonne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
of the duke of Clarence / called Iohan erle
of Marche / to haue ben kynge of Englande / 
and to haue had his nephue kynge Rycharde
depoſed / for he ſayd howe the kynge was nat
worthy to holde nor to gouerne the realme of
Englande. This he wolde ſay to them that he
truſted / and he dyd ſo moch that he cauſed the
erle of Marche to come to his houſe / and than
and there he dyſcouered to hym all his entent
and ſecretneſſe and ſayde / howe he had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myned
to make hym kynge of Englande / and
kyng Richarde to be put downe and his wyfe
alſo / and to be kept in priſon dutynge their ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues / 
and ſo he deſyred effectuouſly the erle to
accept his offre and good wyll / ſayenge howe
he wolde do the beſte he coulde to bringe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute / 
and that he had of his acorde and aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce
the erle of Arundell and therle of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyke / 
and dyuers other prelates and lordes
of Englande. The erle of Marche was ſore
abaſſhed / whan he herde the duke his vncle
ſpeke ſuche wordes / howe be it lyke a yonge
man he diſſymuled the mater / and aunſwered
wyſely / to thentent to pleaſe the duke / and ſaid
howe he <abbr>wold</abbr> be glad to be ruled as he wolde
haue hym / but he ſayd he wolde be well aduy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
or he accepted ſuche promiſſe to ſone / and
wolde take therin aduyſe and delyberacyon.
And whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Glouceſtre ſawe the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
of the erle / than he deſyred him to kepe the
mater ſecrete. The erle anſwered ſo he wolde
do. Than therle departed as ſone as he coude
and ſo wente in to Irelande to his herytage / 
and after he wolde neuer entende to the dukes
treatie / but alwayes excuſed him ſelfe wyſely / 
yet euer he kept the mater ſecrete / for he ſawe
well the concluſyon ſhulde nat be good.</p>
            <p>IT was ſayd howe the duke of Glou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſtre
ſought all the wayes he coude
to ſet a trouble in Englande / and to
ſtyrre the londoners agaynſt the kynge. So
it was the ſame yere that the truce was made
bytwene Englande and Fraunce / to endure
for thyrty yere / and that the kynge was retour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
agayne in to Englande with his yonge
wyfe / than the duke of Glouceſtre enfourmed
the Londoners and ſayd. Syrs / make ye a re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>queſt
to the kynge and it ſhall be reaſonable / 
deſyre that ſeynge he hath peace with his ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myes / 
that ye may be franke and fre fro all ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſydies
and aydes that hath ben graunted this
twenty yere paſt / affyrmyng howe they were
nat graunted but durynge the ſeaſone of the
warre / for ye ſyrs (quod the duke that be mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chauntes
are yuell entreated and ſore oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed / 
to pay of euery hundred florens .xiii. and
all theſe goodes are ſpent in ydleneſſe / in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge
and makynge of feaſtes / and eatynge
and drinkynge / and all ye pay for / wherby ye
be ſore traueyled. and ſhewe you to the kynge
howe ye wolde that the realme of Englande
ſhulde be gouerned acordinge to the auncyent
cuſtomes / and ye may ſay that whan the kyng
hath any nede or the realme / or for the honour
of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey / and for the defence therof / howe
that ye wyll be redy to ayde it / in ſuche wyſe
that the kynge and his counſayle ſhall holde
them content. Thus by the ſettynge on of the
duke of Glouceſtre / the Londoners and the
counſayles of dyuers other cyties and tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of Englande / aſſembled theym togyther / 
and on a day came to Eltham a ſeuen myle fro
London / where the kyng was / and whan they
came before the Kynge they made a requeſt
<pb n="cclxxxv" facs="tcp:22067:299"/>
of all theſe foreſayd thynges / and wolde that
it ſhulde haue ben acomplyſſhed incontynent.
And whan this requeſt was made there was
with the kynge no mo of his vncles but two / 
the dukes of Lancaſtre and of yorke. Than
the kynge charged the Duke of Lancaſtre to
make theym an aunſwere / and than the duke
ſayd to them. ſyrs / the kynges pleaſure is that
ye departe home euery man to his owne / and
within a moneth aſſemble agayne togyder at
London or at Weſtmynſter / &amp; there the kynge
wyll be with his counſayle / and his nobles / 
prelates and other / and they they wyll be redy
to here your requeſtes / and loke what ſhall be
thought neceſſary by his counſayle / the kynge
wyll graunt it you / in ſuche wyſe that ye ſhall
all be well contente. This aunſwere pleaſed
many of them / but nat all / for there were ſome
that were of the opinyon of the duke of Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtre / 
who wolde haue had a ſhorter anſwere / 
but the dukes of Lancaſtre and of yorke apea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them with fayre ſwete wordes / and ſo they
departed for that tyme. But for all that they
left nat their purſute / ſo that the next moneth
after they aſſembled at Weſtmynſter / there be
ynge the kynge with his counſayle / and than
there was preſent the duke of Glouceſtre / who
greatly enclyned to their demaundes / but at
makinge of the aunſwere he ſpake nat all that
he thought in his hert / but diſſymuled the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / 
to the entent that the kynge nor his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
ſhulde nat perceyue his mynde. Than
the duke of Lancaſtre made the aunſwere to
the londoners for the kynge and ſayd. ye ſyrs
of London and other / the kynge hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
me to gyue you a determynable anſwere
to your requeſtes in his name and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle / 
and by the conſent of other prelates and
noble men of his realme. Sirs ye knowe well
to the entent to eſchewe all parelles and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that myght come to this Realme / there
was a generall graunt made by you and other
of the good cyties and townes of Englande / 
that there ſhulde be rayſed a tayle on the ſtate
of marchaundyſe / in maner and fourme as it
hath tynne nowe vpon a ſyxe yere / that was
to paye of euery hundred .xiii. and by reaſon
therof the kynge graunted and ſealed to you
certayne frauncheſſes / the whiche he is nat in
mynde to take fro you / but rather to encreaſe
it dayly acordyng to your deſertes. but where
as ye nowe wolde repell agayne that ye ones
wyllyngly agreed vnto and graunted / ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here openly he repelyth agayne all ſuche
graces and grauntes as he hath made to you
before this tyme. Beholde here all theſe noble
men and prelates haue ſworne and promeſſed
to the kynge to ayde and ſuſtayne all thynges
lawfully gyuen and graunted. therfore ſyrs
conſidre well that the ſtate of the king is great
and chargeable / and if it augment in one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner / 
it mynyſſheth in another / for the rentes
and reuene was turneth nat to the kynges pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyte
as moche as it hath doone in tyme paſte / 
the kinge and his counſayle hath ben at great

bytwene Englande and Fraunce / and great
charge it hath been to the kynge for ſuche am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
as haue treated bytwene the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties / 
as well here as beyonde the ſee / alſo the
purſuynge of the kynges maryage hath coſte

bytwene the realmes / yet the charge is great
of kepynge of the garyſons in townes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelles /

as well in Gaſcoyne / Burdeloys / Bayonois /

whiche may nat be vnprouyded / and alſo the

departed at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyme without any other thynge
<pb facs="tcp:22067:300"/>
doynge / and the moſte parte of theym were
well content / and ſuche as wolde the contrary
made no ſemblante therof at that tyme. The
duke of Glouceſtre retourned to his maner of
Plaſſhey / and he ſawe well as at that tyme he
coulde nat brynge his purpoſe to paſſe / but
ſtyll he ſtudyed howe to make trouble in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande / 
and to fynde the wayes howe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe
the warre in Fraunce and he had of his
acorde his wyfes vncle the Erle of Arundell / 
who deſyred nothynge but warre / and they
had doone ſo moche that they had drawen to
their acorde the erle of Warwyke.</p>
            <p>TTHe kinge of Englande had two
bretherne by his mother / one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Thomas Erle of Kente / and
the ſeconde ſir Iohan of Holande
a valyaunt knyght / who had to his wyfe the
doughter of the duke of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>caſtre / he was erle
of Huntyngdon and chamberlayne with the
kynge / it was he that ſlewe the ſonne of Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde
erle of ſtafforde / as ye haue herde here
before in this hyſtorie. The ſayde Rycharde
erle of Stafforde had a ſquyer to his ſonne / 
who was with the duke of Glouceſtre. This
erle of Huntyngdon moſte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly was euer
in the courte with the kynge his brother / and
he knewe more of the dealynge of the duke of
Glouceſtre than any other dyd / for couertely
and wyſely he made enquery / and alſo he dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
greatly the duke / for he knewe he was fell
and ſodayne / and hyghe mynded / and ſawe
howe he kept his enemye aboute hym / for the
dethe of the yonge Stafforde / and the peace
therof was neuer made / but the grudge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
contynued ſtyll. The kynge loued well his
brother / and bare him againſt euery man. and
the kynge ſawe well howe his vncle the duke
of Glouceſtre was euer contrary to hym / and
was euer about to conſpyre agaynſt him / and
to ſtyrre the realme to rebellyon. ſo the kynge
and his brother of Holande wolde often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
comune togyther. The ſame ſeaſone the
frenche kyng had ſent the erle of ſaynt Powle
in to Englande to ſe the kyng and his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the quene and to noriſſhe loue / for the truce
was made in ſuche maner and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dycion / that
their ſubgiettes myght repayre eche to other
in dyſpyte of all their yuell wyllers. the kynge
and the erle of Huntyngdon made them good
chere / as well for the honoure of the Frenche
kynge / as for that he had wedded their ſuffer.
At that tyme the Dukes of Lancaſtre nor of
yorke were nat with the kynge / for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
ſomwhat to diſſymule / for they ſawe well

            <p>THis kyng of Cypre had good cauſe

he cauſed to be ſlayne &amp; murdered by night /

            <p>This kynge of Cypre had a fayre yonge
ſonne. The Cyprience crowned this chylde
kynge / and after his crownyng he lyued nat

the genouois with great puyſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce brought

            <p>WHan theſe knightꝭ were thus brought

Than they that were ſent thyder fro

ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tylly / ſo that they were more at their

howe be it they were kept euer ſo ſtrayte
that they coulde nat haue the thyrde parte of

herde euer the ſoueraygne of Flaunders / for
ſyr Iaques of Helley hadde enfourmed hym
howe he was one of the chyefe of counſayle
with the duke of Burgoyne. Lamorabaquy
was in a Caſtell beſyde Burſe / and thyther
came the ſayde meſſangers. As laſte it was a

and taryed in pledge with Lamorabaquy.
And the erle of Neuers ſware and bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de him
ſelfe to the ſayd marchauntes / that as ſone as
he came to Venyce / nat to departe thens tyll
the money were payed. Thus concluded this

of the ayre and courſe meates / that he dyed at

wherof all his company were ryght ſory / but
they coulde nat amende it. Thus ſyr Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyppe
of Arthois erle of Ewe and conſtable of
Fraunce / after he was deed was enbawmed / 
and ſo brought in to Fraunce / and buryed in
the churche of ſaynt Laurence of Ewe. Whan
Lamorabaquy was contented with the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundes

the ſoueraygne of Flaunders and ſir Iaques

conſydered the payne and traueyle that they
had endured / and ſpecyally the ſoueraygne of
Flaunders was greatly in his fauour. Theſe
two knyghtes thanked the kynge of his gyft / 
than they toke their leaue of hym / and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
of the Frenche knyghtes and lordes.
Whan they were departed fro the kynge they

toke a galee paſſenger to ſayle to Mathelyn.
At their departynge fro the porte the wether

and had a marueylous great tempeſt / ſo that
the ſoueraigne of Flaunders by reaſon of ſore

were right ioyfull / and thanked the knyght of
his traueyle and payne he had taken in that
iourney.</p>
            <p>WHan the redempcyon of theſe lordes
and knyghtes of Fraunce was at a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poynt
/ than Lamorabaquy thought
or they departed to haue them in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and that they ſhulde be more at large and

was reaſon / ſythe they were no lenger priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners / 
he thought they ſhulde ſe parte of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſſaunce
and ſtate / whiche was as it was ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
me / marueylous great and ſumptuous / 
and kepte moche people dayly aboute hym.
Thus he ſent of the noble men of his houſe to
bring them to his preſence / to whom he made
good chere / and had euery thynge delyuered
them of the ordinary of his courte / acordynge
to the vſage of the countrey / and euery daye
the kynge talked with the erle of Neuers by
a truchman / and greatly he honoured the erle
of Neuers / for he ſawe well he was lyke to be
a great man in Fraunce / and ſonne to a great
<abbr>lord</abbr>/wherof he was well enfourmed / the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
he founde true / by reaſon of the great ſute
that was made for their redempcyon / and by
the great ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of money that they agreed to
paye. The erle of Neuers and his company
had great marueyle of the great ſtate that he
kept / he and his people laye euer in the felde / 
for no towne coulde ſuffyce them. The ſpence
of his howſeholde and charge of meate and
drinke / was marueyle to conſydre fro whence
it ſhulde come / but that the countrey is ſo hote
that the people be of ſobre dyet / and vſe moche

wherof they haue great haboundaunce / the
whiche is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon drinke of the ſarazyns / and
they haue plenty of bredde / made of a grayne
called mylle / he had euer aboute hym a ſeuen
thouſande fawconers and as many hunters.
So it was on a daye he wente a hawkynge / 
and had a flyght with a fawcon at an Egle in
the preſence of the erle of Neuers / the whiche
flyght pleaſed nat Lamorabaquy / wherwith
he was ſore dyſpleaſed / and as it was ſhewed
me / for the ſame faute there was at the poynte
a two thouſande fauconers to haue loſte their

nat dylygent in kepynge of his hawkes. Ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
tyme in the preſence of the erle of Neuers
a woman came to complayne to the kynge / de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyringe
to haue ryght and iuſtyce vpon a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt

and as ſoone as I ſayde ſo / he gaue me two

I ſpake in your name / therfore ſyr kynge do
me iuſtyce / as ye are ſworne to do to all your
people. The kinge marked well the womans
wordes / and ſo cauſed his ſeruaunte to come
a fore hym / and the woman alſo / and than he
cauſed the woman to renewe her complaynt.
The ſeruaunt began to excuſe hym / and ſayd
that he knewe nothynge of that matter. The
woman ſpake wyſely and affyrmed her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
to be trewe. Than the kynge ſayde / wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
aduyſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> well / for if I fynde thy wordes

quod ſhe I am content / for if my wordes were

do me iuſtyce I deſyre none other thyng.
Thou ſhalt haue iuſtyce quod the kynge / for
I haue ſworne ſo to do to euery man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Than the kynge cauſed the man to be
taken and cauſed his bely to be opened / to ſe if
he had eaten or dronken the mylke or nat / and
there he founde that he had dronke the mylke
for it was nat turned to digeſtyon. And whan
the kyng ſawe that the womans wordes were

to complayne / go thy way quyte thou art well
reuenged of the treſpaſe that was done

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Han the duke of Gloceſtre was
brought to the caſtell of Calys / 
than he feared hym ſelfe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye / 
&amp; ſaid to the erle Marſhall
For what cauſe am I brought
out of Englande hyder to Calais? Me thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
ye holde me as a priſoner. Lette me go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode
and ſe the fortreſſe aboute. Sir quod
the marſhall / that ye deſyre I dare nat do it / 
for I haue the charge vpon you on payne of
my lyfe. The kynge my ſoueraygne lorde is
a lytell myſcontente with you. Wherfore / ye
muſte take pacyence here for a ſeaſone / tyll I

I am right ſorie for your trouble if I myght
remedy it. But ſir / ye knowe well I am ſwor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
to the kynge / wherfore I muſt obey / and
ſo wyll I do / for ſauynge of myne honoure.
The duke coude haue none other aunſwere / 
But by that he ſawe / he feared greatly his

ſange maſſe before hym / that he myght be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.
And ſo he was at good leyſar before
the ſacrament / with deuout herte / and cryed
God mercy / and was ſore repentaunt of all
his ſynnes. And in dede it was tyme ſo for
hym ſo to do / for his dethe was nerer to hym
than he was ware of. For as I was enfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med / 
whan he hadde dyned and was aboute
to haue waſſhen his handes / There came in
to the chambre foure men / and caſte ſodayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
a towell aboute the dukes necke / two at
the one ende and two at the other / and drewe
ſo ſore that he fell to the Erthe / and ſo they
ſtrangled hym / and cloſed his eyen. &amp; whan
he was deed they diſpoyled hym / and bare
hym to his beed / and layde hym bytwene the
ſhetes all naked / and his heed on a ſofte pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe / 
and couered with clothes furred. And
than they yſſued out of the chambre in to the
hall / well determyned what they wolde ſaye
and ſayde openly / Howe a palueyſye hadde
taken the duke of Glouceſtre the ſame night
ſodaynly / and ſo dyed. Theſe wordes anon
were abrode in the towne of Calais. Some
beleued theym and ſome natte. Within two
dayes that the duke was thus deed / the erle

he was his nere coſyn / and were ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny

Fraunce and in Flaunders than in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
The Frenche men were gladde therof / For
there was a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon brute / that there ſhulde
be no good peace bytwene Fraunce and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande / 
as long as he lyued. And in all trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties
bytwene Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and Englande / he was

dyed in Calais. his body was enbaumed

by See in to Englande. And the Shyppe
that caryed hym / arryued at the Caſtell of

but the erle of Saliſbury who was in

by theirs. Affyrming howe there was neuer
none of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Beauchampes that euer dyd tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

the erle of Warwyke for pytie was reſpyted
fro dethe. He was banyſſhed in to the yſle of

Alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Lancaſtre had .ii. of his dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters

            <p>THus the kyng of Englande had peace
with his vncles / bycauſe of the dethe
of the duke of Glouceſtre. Than he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ganne
to reygne more fierſly than he dyd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The kynge went and lay in Eſſex / where
as the duke of Glouceſtre had the chiefe rule / 
whiche ought to haue pertaygned to Affcen

by enherytaunce was conſtable of Englande
the kynge toke that offyce fro the right heyre / 
and gaue it to his coſyn the erle of Rutlande.
The kynge than kept greate ſtate than euer
he dyd: nor there had nat ben no kynge before
in Englande that ſpente ſo moche yerely by a
hundred thouſande nobles as he dyd. In lyke
wyſe the kynge had with hym the heyre of the
erle of Arundell / who was beheeded at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
And bycauſe a knyght that was belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng
to the duke of Glouceſtre called Cerbe / 
ſpake at a tyme certayne wordes agaynſt the
kynge and his counſayle / he was taken and
beheeded. Syr Iohan of Quynghay was in
great parell / but whan he ſawe that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
went ſo dyuerſely as they dyd / he dyſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muled
as moch as he might / and departed fro
the ducheſſe of Glouceſtres houſe / and wente
and dwelt in other places. ¶In thoſe dayes
there was none ſo great in Englande / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> durſt
ſpeake agaynſt any thynge that the kyng dyd
or wolde do. He had counſayle mete for his ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petyte / 
who exhorted hym to do what he lyſt.
The kynge kept ſtyll in his wages ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande

of his vncles / nor of the lygnage of Arundell.

lordes and prelates of Almayne: No lorde of

The duke of Orlyau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſet euery man downe.
Veſſell of golde and ſyluer ranne plentuouſly
through the palays / as though it had ben but
of wode or erthe / it was a ſumptuous dyner.
And as I was enfourmed the frenche kynge
gaue to his coſyn the kyng of Almayne all the
veſſell and plate of <abbr>gold</abbr> and ſyluer / that was
ſerued that day in the palays at the dreſſer or

the kynge retrayed after dynner / and ſpyces

valewed to two hundred thouſande florayns / 
and more ouer there was gyuen to the other
almayns / great gyftes and goodly preſentes
of veſſell and plate of golde and ſyluer / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the ſtraungers that were there had great
marueyle of the ſtate and puyſſaunce / &amp; great

and openly publyſſhed through the cytie / but
as for the mater conſernynge the popes / there
was nothynge knowen therof out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayle / 
for all that was concluded in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle
was kept ſecrete. Afterwarde I was en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fourmed / 
how it was agreed that maiſter Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
Daylly byſſhop of Cambraye / ſhulde go

called pope Bonyface / that he ſhulde ſubmyt
hym ſelfe to haue a newe electyon of a pope / 
and in lykewyſe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other pope at Auygnon.
And if ſo be that any of them wolde nat agree
therto / to abyde the ordre of theſe two kynges
he to be dyſgrated &amp; all ryghtes of the churche
to be kepte fro hym / and the frenche kynge to

I ſette your wordes at the kynges pleaſure /

Than the erle of Rutlande who was con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtable

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E maye well knowe this matter
greatly troubled the courte / and
many lordes and knyghtes were
ſore dyſpleaſed of that aduenture
and ſecretly they greatly blamed
the erle Marſhall / but he made as though he
had ſer nothyng by the mater / his hert was ſo
proude &amp; preſumptuous. Thus the lordes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day. The duke of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>caſtre what

kynge ſhulde nat haue taken the mater as he
dyd / but ſhulde rather haue tourned it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge / 
and ſo thought the moſte parte of all
the lordes of Englande. The erle of Derby
went and lay at London / and helde his eſtate
at his owne lodgynge / and there were pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for him / the duke of Lancaſtre his father / 
the duke of yorke / the Erle of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande / 
and dyuers other lordes. And the erle
Marſhall was ſente to the towre of London / 
and there helde his eſtate. Theſe two lordes
made prouyſyon / for that was neceſſary for
them for their batayle. The erle of Derby ſent
his meſſangers in to Lombardy to the duke
of Myllayne ſyr Galeas / for to haue armure
at his pleaſure. The duke agreed to the erles
deſyre / and cauſed the knight that the erle had
ſent thyder / whoſe name was Fraunces / to ſe

four of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt armorers that were in Lombar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
to the erle in to Englande with the knight / 
to the entent that they ſhulde arme and make
armure acordynge to the erles entente. The
erle Marſhall on his parte ſent in to Almayn
and in to other places to prouyde him for that
iourney. The charge of theſe two lordes was
greate / but the erle of Derby was at mooſt
charge. The erle Marſhall whan he beganne
that buſyneſſe / he thought to haue had more
ayde of the kynge than he had / for ſuche as
were nere aboute the kynge ſayd to him. Syr
ye haue nothyng to do to medle bytwene theſe

in the realme / and ſpecyally with the Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners / 
and if they ſe that ye ſhulde take parte

At the metyng there was frendly chere / 
and ſo in good order they entred in to Paris
with great ioye. The ſame daye one great

            <p>THus they came to the houſe ofſaynt

receyued the erle nobly / and therle

And after takyng of ſpyce and wyne / the erle

Peter de Ailly byſſhoppe of Cambrey / 
was ſent in legacion to Rome to ſpeke with
pope Boniface. he ſpedde hym ſo in his iour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney
that he came to Fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / and there fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
pope Boniface / and to hym he delyuered his
letters of credence / dyrected fro the kynges
of Almaygne and of Fraunce. The pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
them / and the byſſhoppe right meke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.
The pope knewe well parte of his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
Than the byſſhoppe declared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe
of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mynge. Whan the pope hadde well
herde hym he ſayde / Howe the anſwere laye

nalles that had choſen hym pope. but he ſaid
whan he hadde ſpoken with them by delybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
counſayle / than he wolde make ſuche an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwere
that he truſted to content them. This
aunſwere was ſuffycient for that tyme. The
byſſhoppe dyned that daye in the popes pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce / 
and certayne Cardynalles with hym.
Than after the pope departed fro Foundes
and went to Rome / and there the pope aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled
a conuocacion of the cardynalles in his
palyce beſyde ſaynt Peters churche. In this
conſiſtorie there were none but the pope and
his cardynalles / And there the pope ſhewed
the requeſt that the kynge of Almaygne and
the Frenche kyng had made hym by the byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe
of Cambrey / &amp; there he demaunded
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile what anſwere he ſhuld make. there

right contrary to the cardinalles to put

ſhulde be greatly to their ſhame and rebuke
Than they ſaid to the pope. Holy father / to

wyll obey to the / ye muſt ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>what diſſymule y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
mater / and ſaye howe ye wyll gladly obey to
all thynge that the kynge of Almaygne / the
kyng of Hungry / and the kyng of Englande
wyll counſayle you vnto. So that he that is
in Auignon / who writeth hym ſelfe pope Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nedic / 
whom the Frenche kyng and the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chmen
vpholde in his errour / that he depoſe

bretherne the cardynalles. This counſayle
pleaſed well pope Boniface. This was the
ſpeciall and generall aunſwere that the byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe
of Cambrey had. And whan the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns
vnderſtode that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynges of Almay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne
and of Fraunce / had ſente to their pope
their ambaſſade / to haue him to leaue his pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>palyte / 
anone there multiplyed great mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muracion / 
through the cytie of Rome. And
the Romayns douted greatly to leſe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
ſiege / whiche was yerely to them a gret
profyte. For all pardons that ſhulde be two
yere after / the vantage therof ſhulde growe

they had made great prouiſyon / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they douted leſt it ſhulde haue ben loſte / 
whiche ſhulde greatly haue ben to their pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iudyce.
Than the mooſt notableſt perſones
in Rome aſſembled togyder / and came to the
Pope and ſhewed hym more ſigne of loue / 
than euer they hadde done before / and ſayd.
Holy father / ye are the trewe pope / therfore
leſe nat your herytage and patrimony of the
churche / the whiche was ſaynt Peters. take
neuer counſayle to the contrarye / but abyde
ſtyll as pope. For who ſoeuer be agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt you / 
we ſhall abyde with you / and ieoparde oure
bodyes and goodes / to defende you in youre

welbeloued chyldren be of good confort / and
be well aſſured / that I wyll abyde as pope / 
for any treatie of kynge or kynges to the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary.
Thus the Romayns were contented
and apeaſed / and retourned to their houſes.
The popes anſwere was alwayes to the byſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhoppe
of Cambrey / that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he parceyued
clerely that Benedic depoſed hymſelfe / than
he ſaid / he wolde be ordred by the ſayde kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
So the byſſhoppe retourned and came
in to Almaygne / and founde the kyng at Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ualence / 
and there he ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anſwere that

ſayde. Well. Shewe all this to our bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther

ordreth hym ſelfe ſo ſhall I order me / and all

Than the byſſhoppe departed fro the kyng /

and were in dyſcorde. The moſt parte depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of the conſyſtory / and toke no leaue of
the pope / and retourned to their lodgynges.
Some ſuche as were in this popes fauour ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryed
ſtyll with hym. Whan the byſſhoppe of
Cambray ſawe howe they departed in ſuche
maner / he knewe well they acorded nat well / 
and therwith auaunced hym ſelfe / and entred
in to the conſyſtory / and ſo came to the Pope
whyle he ſate ſtyll in his ſee / and without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
of any great reuerence ſayde. Syr gyue
me myne aunſwere / ſythe ye haue had your
counſayle aboute you / ye ought to gyue me
myne aunſwere that I may retourne. This
pope Benedic who was in great dyſpleaſure
for the wordes that the cardynall of Amyence
had ſpoken / ſayd. Byſſhoppe of Cambray I
haue counſayle of dyuers of my bretherne the
cardynals / who hath created me in to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyte
papall / and haue receyued all the ſolemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nytyes
therto belongyng / and am writen and
named pope by all my ſubgiettes / and as pope
I wyll abyde as longe as I lyue / I wyll nat
do the contrary to dye in the payne / for I haue
doone no cauſe why to leſe it / and ſaye to our
ſonne of Fraunce / that hyther vnto I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken
him as a good catholyke prince / but nowe
byſyniſter meanes if he wyll entre in to great
errour / he wyll repente it. I praye you to ſay
to hym fro me / that he be well aduyſed howe
he enclyneth to any thinge that ſhulde trouble
his conſcyence. Therwith this Benedic roſe
out of his chayre / and went in to his chambre / 
and certayne cardynalles with hym / and the
byſſhoppe of Cambray retourned to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge / 
and dyned ſobrely / and than after toke
his horſe and paſſed the bridge of Rone / and
came to vile Nefe / and at nyght lay at Baig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noulx / 
whiche partaygned to the Realme of
Fraunce / and he vnderſtode that ſyr Boucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quant
marſhall of Fraunce was come to porte
ſaynt Andrewe a nyne leages fro Auygnon.
The nexte day thyder came the byſſhoppe of
Cambray / and ſhewed hym the aunſwere of
Benedic. Whan the marſhall vnderſtode that
this pope Benedic wolde nat obey the kynge
his mayſters ordynaunce / he ſayd to the byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.
ſyr ye are beſt to retourne in to Fraunce / 
ye haue no more to do here / and I ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
that I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to do by the kynge
and his vncles. The next daye the byſſhoppe
departed and toke the way to Albenoys and
to Pyne / and the marſhall ſet clerkes awarke
to write / and ſente for knyghtes / ſquyers and
men of warre through all the countrey of Viu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rays / 
of Vyuieres / and Auuergne to Mount
pellyer / for he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myſſyon ſo to do by the

that he ſhulde cloſe all the paſſages as
well by the ryuer of Rone as by lande / to the
entent that nothynge ſhulde entre in to Auig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.
He wente hym ſelfe to the pownte ſaynt
Eſperyte / and cloſed there the paſſage ouer
the ryuer of Rone / that nothynge ſhulde entre
that way in to Auygnon. Thus the marſhall
<pb n="cccii" facs="tcp:22067:316"/>
daily gathered men of warre / and many came
to ſerue hym / ſome for obeyſaunce / and ſome
to pyll and robbe theym of Auygnon. There
came to hym ſyr Raymonde of Thourayne / 
and the lorde de la Both / the lorde of Tornon / 
the lorde of Monclaue / and the lorde Duſes / 
ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the marſhall had a great nombre of men.
Than the marſhall ſent an haraulde to defye
pope Benedic in his palays / and all the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynals
that wolde take his parte. This was
harde tydynges to the cardynals / and to them

ſayd they muſt lyue and haue their marchaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyſe

taryed in the towne of Sourgnes with a gret

This to do the marſhall promyſed. So they

Scotlande / of Aragone / and of Nauer / and
howe that all Almayne / Boeſme / and Italy / 
were of the ſame opynyon. In lykewyſe the

<abbr>ſhuld</abbr> folowe the ſame. Whan the prelates and

were ſent for / herde that mater they had great

and lette no man put it fro vs / without there
be greater apparaunce of a ſurer foundacyon /

the dyfference and murmurynge of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy / 
he cauſed the byſſhoppe of London to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
of all the clergy what was beſt to do.
They all aunſwered that the matter was ſo
great / that therin requyred great counſayle
and delyberacyon / and ſo they departed / and
euery man went to his lodgynge. And whan
the londoners knewe the cauſe of that aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble / 
and the requeſt that the kynge had made / 
they were than ſore troubled agaynſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng /

hym ſelfe honeſtly therfro. All theſe

            <p>IF kyng Richarde had wyſely conſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred

cauſed by colour of loue / the duke of Glouce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtre

he was ſtrangled and murdered. Wherof
great brute was throughe out all the realme
with great grudge and murmuracyons / ſo
that it was at the poynt to haue depoſed the

of Lancaſtre lyke a ſage and a prudent price
for all that the duke of Glouceſtre was his

All this the kynge ought to haue conſydred /

it is marueyle / that the Frenche kynge and

Frenche kynges doughter. But ſythe they
do nothynge therin / it is beſt we holde oure

kynge &amp; his brother and his vncles / thought
nothyng but good. They honoured and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
greatly the erle of Derby / and deſyred

Philyppe of Arthoys erle of Ewe / who died
in his retourne in Hungry: as ye haue herde

well that the duke of Lancaſtre was a great

The meſſangers retourned to the kynge / and

for this cauſe and for other thynges that were

they were openly banyſſhed the realme of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande /

This was publyſſhed through out all the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

in London / wherof the londoners had
great marueyle / nor they coulde nat knowe
iuſtly for what cauſe it was / for the erle and
his ſonne were reputed for noble and as valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt

ſayd / it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by ſome of the kynges coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle

though they ſaid the trouth / and for their true
ſayeng nowe they be puniſſhed / but we thinke
herafter they wyll be punyſſhed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nowe iudge

this mater. The erle had a brother a valiaunt
knight ſir Thomas percy / who had of a longe
tyme done many noble ſeruyces to the kynge
of Englande. whan the erle knewe that he and
his ſonne were banyſſhed the realme / he toke
it for an vnreaſonable punyſſhment without
cauſe. Than he ſente for all his frendes in the
countrey / ſuche as he coulde get togyther / for
many of his lygnage were with the kynge to
go in to Irelande. The erle toke counſayle of
them what was beſt to do ſythe the kynge had
banyſſhed hym without cauſe. Than he was
counſayled to ſende in to the realme of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande / 
and to deſyre the king there that he and
his ſonne might abyde peaſably in Scotlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de / 
tyll the kynge of Englande were apeaſed
of his dyſpleaſure. Thus therle ſent to kynge
Robert of Scotlande / and the kyng &amp; the erle
Archambalt Duglas / and the other lordes of
Scotlande condiſcendyd lyghtly to the erles
deſyre / &amp; ſent the erle worde howe they ſhulde
be gladly receyued / and alſo if they neded of
fyue or ſyre hundred ſpeares / if they were ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfied
of the tyme they ſhulde be redy to ſerue
them. This meſſage pleaſed greatly the erle
and his lygnage / and ſo the erle taryed ſtyll in
his countrey amonge his frendes / for kynge
Rycharde and his counſayle had ſo moche to
do in ſorte ſeaſon after / that they had no lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer

laborers and marchauntes in Englande
were wonte to lyue in reſt and peace / and to
occupy their marchaundyſe peaſably / and the
laborers to labour their landes quyetly / and
than it was contrary / for whan marchauntes
rode fro towne to towne with their marchaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyſe / 
and had outher golde or ſyluer in their
purces / it was taken fro them / and fro other
men / and labourers out of their houſes. theſe

muttons / porkes / &amp; the pore men durſte ſpeke
no worde. theſe yuell dedes dayly multyplyed
ſo that great complayntes and lamentacyons

            <p>THus multyplyed the lamentacyons
and murmurynge in Englande / and
the prelates and other ryche men of
the realme came to London to dwell / there to
be in the better ſuretie. They of the lygnages
of ſuche lordes as the kynge had put to dethe
and baniſſhed the realme / they were gladde of
all this / and wolde that more trouble had ben

whan the men in Englande and ſpecyally the

what for loue and pytie toke on him the vyage

with four hundred men of warre / and
ſo aryued in Englande / and by the ayde of the

for without their ayde it wolde haue ben hard

and Edwarde his ſonne crowned kynge at

remembred / for they that were yonge herde
this reported of their elders / and ſome founde
it in writynge / and they ſayd ſecretly one to a

tyme prouyded for theſe greate miſchiefes / and
we thinke there was neuer greater cauſe than
nowe at this preſent tyme / for ſuffer this kyng
Rycharde to haue his wyll and he wyll waſte

hath nat been in Englande ſuche proſperyte

howe iuſtyce had no place to reygne for faute

            <p>WHan the erle had herde the byſſhops

with me / and to be as my priſoner in the
towre of London. The kyng who ſawe hym

hym ſelfe priſoner to the erle of Derby and
bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de hym ſelfe / and promyſed to do all that
he wolde haue hym to do. In lykewiſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

horſes to be ſadylled &amp; brought forthe

erle of Derby cauſed a crye to be made / on

euery thyng was a preparyng / the kyng and
the erle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned toguyder in the court / and
were well regarded by the Londoners. And
as it was entormed me / kynge Richarde had
a grayhounde called Mathe / who alwayes
wayted vpon the kynge / and wolde knowe
no man els. For whan ſoeuer the kyng dyde
ryde / he that kept the grayhounde dyde lette

as the kyng &amp; the erle of Derby talked togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the courte / the grayhounde who was
wont to lepe vpon the kyng / left the kynge &amp;
came to the erle of Derby duke of Lancaſtre

of the kyng what the grayhounde
wolde do. Coſyn quod the kyng / it is a gret

Sir / howe knowe you that quod the duke?
I knowe it well quod the kyng. The gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounde

            <p>SO euery man lepte a horſbacke and
departed fro the caſtell of Flynt / &amp;
entred in to the feldes. Thus duke
Henry of Lancaſtre / who was no more cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
erle of Derby but duke of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>caſtre / rode
by the kyng and oftentymes talked togider / 
and men of warre before &amp; behynde in great

night they laye about Oxenforde. The duke
of Lancaſtre ledde kyng Richarde by no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelles
nor good townes / for feare of ſtyring
of the people / but alwayes kepte the feldes.
Than the duke gaue lycence to a great nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre

They dyde as the duke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / who
toke the way to Wyndſore / and came thyder /

offycers and ſeruauntes. They were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

rode to Shene / and fro thens in the nyght

They were angry that the duke had

ſecondly the duke of Lancaſtre ſent to therle

ſo they dyde. After he enquered and ſought
out to haue the foure companyons that had

in the caſtell of Calais. They were ſo well
ſought out / that they were all taken: They
were ſette in priſone aparte in Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don. than

yere / and as than they determined to kepe him
in priſone. Than they regarded what caſe the
realme ſtode in / and dyd put all his dedes in
artycles to the nombre of .xxviii. Than the du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
of Lancaſtre and his counſayle went to the
towre of London / and entred in to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
where kynge Rycharde was / and without
any reuerence makynge to hym / there was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
redde all the ſaid artycles / to the whiche
the kynge made none aunſwere / for he ſawe
well all was true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was layde to his charge / 
ſauynge he ſayd / all that I haue doone paſſed
by my counſayle. Than he was demaunded
what they were that had gyuen cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle / and
by whome he was moſt ruled / he named them
in truſt therby to haue ben delyuered himſelfe
in accuſynge of them / as he had doone before
tyme / truſtynge therby to ſcape / and to bringe
them in the daunger and payne / but that was
nat the mynde of them that loued hym nat. ſo
as at that tyme they ſpake no more but depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted / 
and the duke of Lancaſtre went to his lod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gynge / 
and ſuffred the mayre and the men of
lawe to procede. They went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Guyldhall / 
where as all the maters of the cytie were deter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myned / 
and than moche people aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled there.
Whan they ſawe the gouernours of the cytie
go thyder / they thought ſome iuſtice ſhulde be
done / as there was in dede. I ſhall ſhewe you
howe. Fyrſte the artycles that were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
the kynge / the whiche had been redde
before hym in the towre / were redde agayne
there openly. And it was ſhewed by hym that
redde them / howe the kynge hymſelfe denyed
none of them / but confeſſed that he dyd theym
by the counſayle of four knightes of his cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre / 
and howe by their counſayle he had put
to dethe the duke of Glouceſtre and the erle of
Aru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dell / ſir Thomas Corbet / and other / and
howe they had longe encyted the kynge to do
thoſe dedes / whiche dedes they ſayd were nat
to be forgyuen / but demaunded punycion / for
by them and their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle the iuſtyce of right
was cloſed vp through all the courtes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande /

yuell dedes folowed / and companyes and
rowtes of theues and murderers roſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
togyther in dyuers parties of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme /

the realme was in great parell to haue ben

that fynally the wolde haue rendred Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lais
or Guyſnes / or bothe in to the frenchmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

people made many to be abaſſhed / and many
beganne to murmure and ſayd. Theſe cauſes
demaunde punycion / that all other may take
enſample therby / and Rycharde of Burdeaur
to be depoſed / for he is nat worthy to beare a
crowne / but ought to be depriued fro all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour / 
and to be kept all his lyfe in priſon with
breed and water. Though ſome of the villay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
murmured / other ſaid on hygh. ſir mayre
of London / and ye other that haue iuſtyce in
your handes to mynyſter / execute iuſtyce / for
we wyll ye ſpare no man / for ye ſe well the caſe
that ye haue ſhewed vs demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth iuſtyce in
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynent / for they are iudges vpon their owne
dedes. Than the mayre and other of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
of the lawe went togyther in to the
chambre of iudgement. than theſe four knygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
were iudged to dye / and were iudged to be
had to the foote of the towre where as kynge
Richarde was / that he might ſe them drawen
alonge by the dyke with horſes eche after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / 
throughe the cytie in to chepeſyde / and
than there heedes ſtryken of there / and ſette
vpon London bridge / and there bodyes dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen

            <p>THis iudgement gyuen they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered
to execucyon / for the mayre
of London and ſuche as were depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the mater / wente fro the Guyldhall to
the towre / and toke out the four knyghtes of
the kynges / whoſe names were called ſir Ber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>narde
Brokas / ſyr Marelays / mayſter Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Derby receyuour of Lyncolne / and mayſter
Stell the kynges ſtewarde. Eche of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were
tyed to two horſes / in the preſence of them that
were in the towre / and the kynge myght well
ſe it out at the wyndowes / wherwith he was
ſore deſcomforted / for all other that were there
with the kynge loked to be in the ſame caſe / 
they knewe them of London ſo cruell. Thus
theſe four knyghtes were drawen one after a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother
a longe through the cyte tyll they came
<pb facs="tcp:22067:328"/>
in to chepe / and there on a fyſſhers ſtall their

to the gybet / and there hanged vp. This
iuſtyce thus doone / euery man went to their
lodgynges. Kynge Rycharde knowyng him
ſelfe taken / and in the daunger of the londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
was in great ſorowe in his herte / and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kened
his puyſſaunce nothynge / for he ſawe
howe euery man was agaynſte hym. and if
there were any that ought hym any fauour / it
laye nat than in their powers to do hym any
ayde / nor they durſte nat ſhewe it. Suche as
were with the kynge ſayde. Syr / we haue but
ſmall truſt in our lyues as it may well apere / 
for whan your coſyn of Lancaſtre came to the
caſtell of Flynte / and with your owne good
wyll ye yelded you to hym / and he promyſed
that you and twelue of yours <abbr>ſhuld</abbr> be his pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoners
and haue no hurte / and nowe of thoſe
twelue four be executed ſhamfully / we are like
to paſſe the ſame way. The cauſe is / theſe lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doners / 
who hath cauſed the duke of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
your coſyn to do this dede / had hym ſo
ſore bounde to them that he muſte do as they
wyll haue hym. God dothe moche for vs / if he
ſuffre that we myght dye here our naturall
deth / and nat a ſhamfull dethe. It is great py<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
to thynke on this. With thoſe wordes kyng
Rycharde began te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derly to wepe and wringe
his handes / and curſed the houre that euer he
was borne / rather than to haue ſuche an ende.
Suche as were aboute hym had great pytie
and recomforted hym as well as they might.
One of his knyghtes ſayd. Syr / it behoueth
you to take comforte / we ſe well and ſo do you
that this worlde is nothyng / the fortunes ther
of are marueylous / and ſomtyme tourne as
well vpon kinges and princes / as vpon poore
men. The frenche kynge whoſe doughter ye
haue maryed / canne nat nowe ayde you / he is
to farre of. if ye myght ſcape this myſchefe by
dyſſimulacyon and ſaue your lyfe and ours / 
it were a good enterpriſe / peraduenture with
in a yere or two / there wolde be had ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery.
Why ꝙ the kynge / what wolde ye that
I ſhulde do / there is nothynge but I wolde
be glad to do it / to ſaue vs therby? Syr quod
the knyght / we ſe for trouthe that theſe londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
wyll crowne your coſyn of Lancaſtre as
kynge / and for that entent they ſent for hym / 
and ſo haue ayded hym and do / it is nat poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyble
for you to lyue without ye conſent that
he be crowned kynge / wherfore ſyr / we wyll
counſayle you (to the entent to ſaue your lyfe
and ours) that whan your coſyn of Lancaſtre
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to you to demaunde any thynge / than
with ſwete and treatable wordes ſay to hym / 
howe that ye wyll reſygne to hym the crowne
of Englande / and all the ryght that ye haue in
the realme / clerely and purely in to his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / 
and howe that ye wyll that he be kynge / 
therby ye ſhall greatly apeaſe him and the lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doners
alſo / and deſyre hym effectuouſly to
ſuffre you to lyue and vs alſo with you / or els
euery man a parte / as it ſhall pleaſe him / or els
to baniſſhe vs out of the realme for euer / for he
that leſeth his lyfe leſeth all. Kynge Rycharde
herde thoſe wordes well / and fyxed them ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
in his herte / and ſayd he wolde do as they
counſayled hym / as he that ſawe hym ſelfe in
great daunger. and than he ſayd to them that
kepte hym / howe he wolde gladly ſpeke with
his coſyn of Lancaſtre.

Whan the duke herde that he ſayd.
ſyr it is conuenyent that parte of the thre eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

I haue ſent all redy for ſome noble men / pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates / 
and counſaylours of the good townes

within this thre dayes ſuffycient of them / for

ſuche enormyties and yuels as haue ben vſed

haue more ryght to the crowne than ye haue / 
for whan our grauntfather kynge Edwarde
the thyrde dyd choſe and make you kynge / the
ſame was as than ſhewed hym / but he loued
ſo his ſonne the prince / that none coude breake
his purpoſe nor opinyon / but that you ſhulde

rynneth through <abbr>England</abbr> and in other

that were in the Princes howſe myne vncle / 
howe that he knew well that his wyfe had nat

coſyn germayne to kynge Edwarde / and the

that coulde well kepe the prince in her bandon
by crafte and ſubtylte / ſhe made the prince to

            <p>WHan the duke of Lancaſtre had ben

prelates and clergy of the realme of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande
a great nombre / and alſo dukes / erles /

Thus the people aſſembled at Weſtmynſter /

and there the ſame duke chalenged the realme

reaſones. Fyrſt by conqueſt. ſecondly bycauſe

of Burdeaur had reſygned the Realme in to
his handes by his free wyll / in the preſence of
certayne dukes / erles / prelates / and barones
in the hall within the towre of London. Theſe
thre cauſes ſhewed / the duke of Lancaſtre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred
all the people there preſent / as well one
as other / to ſhewe their myndes and ententes
in that behalfe. Than all the people with one
voyce ſayd / that their wylles was to haue him
kynge / and howe they wolde haue none other
but hym. Than the duke agayne ſayd to the
people. Sirs / is this your myndes. and they
all with one voyce ſayde / ye / ye. And than the
duke ſate downe in the ſyege royall / whiche
ſeate was reyſed vp in the hall / and couered
with a clothe of eſtate / ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery man myght
well ſe hym ſytte. And than the people lyfted
vp their handes a hygh / promyſing hym their
faythe and allegyaunce. Thanne the parlya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded / and the day was taken for his
coronacyon of ſaynt Edwardes day / the mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day
the .xiii. day of Octobre / at whiche tyme / 
the ſaturday before his coronacyon he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fro Weſtmynſter and rode to the towre of
London with a great nombre. and that night
all ſuche ſquyers as ſhulde be made knyghtes
the nexte day / watched / who were to the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
of .xlvi. Euery ſquier had his owne bayne
by him ſelfe / and the next day the duke of Lan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>caſtre
made theym all knyghtes at the maſſe
tyme. Than had they longe cotes with ſtrayte
ſleues furred w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mynyuer lyke prelates / with
whyte laces hangynge on their ſhuldes. And
after dyner the duke departed fro the towre to
Weſtmynſter / &amp; rode all the way bareheeded / 
and aboute his necke the lyuery of Fraunce.
He was acompanyed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince his ſonne
and ſyxe dukes / ſyxe erles / and .xviii. barons / 
and in all knyghtes and ſquyers a nyne hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
horſe. Than the kynge had on a ſhorte
cote of clothe of golde / after the maner of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne / 
and he was mounted on a whyte cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer / 
and the garter on his left legge. Thus the
duke rode through London with a great nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre
of lordes / euery lordes ſeruaunt in their
mayſters lyuery. All the but geſſes &amp; lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb n="cccxv" facs="tcp:22067:329"/>
marchauntes in London / and euery craft
with their lyuerey and deuyſe. Thus he was
conueyed to Weſtmynſter. He was in nombre
a ſyxe thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de horſe / and the ſtreates hanged
as he paſſed by. and the ſame day and the next
there were in London rynnynge ſeuen cundyt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
with wyne whyte and reed. That nyght
the duke was bayned / and the next mornynge
he was confeſſed / and herde thre maſſes as he
was acuſtomed to do / and than all the prelates
and clergy came fro Weſtmynſter churche to
the palays to fetche the kynge with proceſſion
and ſo he went to the churche a proceſſion / and
all the lordes with hym in their robes of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let / 
furred with menyuer / barred of their ſhul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
acordynge to their degrees / and ouer the
kynge was borne a clothe of eſtate of blewe / 
with four belles of golde / and it was borne by
four burgeſſes of the portes / as Douer and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And on euery ſyde of him he had a ſword
borne / the one y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſworde of the churche / and the
other the ſworde of iuſtyce. The ſworde of the
church his ſonne the prince dyd beare / and the
ſworde of iuſtyce therle of Northumberlande
dyd beare / for he was as than conſtable of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande / 
for the erle of Rutlande was depoſed
fro that offyce / and the erle of Weſtmerlande
who was marſhall of Englande / bare the cep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.
Thus they entred in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche about
nyne of the clocke / and in the myddes of the
churche there was an hygh ſcaffolde all coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with reed / and in the myddes therof there
was a chayre Royall / couered with clothe of
golde. Than the kyng ſate downe in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> chayre
and ſo ſate in eſtate royall / ſauynge he had nat
on the crowne / but ſate bare heeded. Than at
four corners of the ſcaff olde / the archebyſſhop
of Caunterbury ſhewed vnto the people howe
god had ſent them a man to be their kyng / and
demaunded if they were content that he ſhulde
be conſecrated and crowned as their kynge.
And they all with one voyce ſayd yea / &amp; helde
vp their handes / promyſynge him faythe and
obeyſaunce. Than the kynge roſe and wente
downe the ſcaffolde to the hygh auter to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred / 
at whiche conſecracyon there were two
archbyſſhoppes and ten byſſhops / and before
the aulter the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he was diſpoyled out of all his
veſtures of eſtate / &amp; there he was anoynted in
vi. places / on the heed / on the breſt &amp; on the two
ſhulders behynde / and on the handes. Than a
bonet was ſer on his heed / and whyle he was
anoyntynge the clergy ſange the latyny / and
ſuche ſeruyce as they ſynge at the halowing of
the fonte. Than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kinge was aparelled lyke a
prelate of the churche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a cope of reed ſylke
and a payre of ſpurres with a poynte without
a rowell. Than the ſworde of iuſtyce was dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
out of the ſhethe and halowed / and than
it was taken to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng / who dyd put it agayne
in to the ſheth / than the archebyſſhop of Caun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terbury
dyd gyrde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſworde about hym. than
ſaynt Edwardes crowne was brought forthe
whiche is cloſe aboue and bleſſed / and than the
archebyſſhop dyd ſette it on the kynges heed.
After maſſe the kyng departed out of the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
in the ſame eſtate and went to his palays / 
and there was a fountayne that ranne by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
braunches whyte wyne and reed. Than
the kyng entred in to the hall / and ſo in to a pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uy
chamber / and after came out agayne to dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner.
At the fyrſt table ſate the kynge. At the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyue peres of the realme / at the thyrde
the valaunt men of London. at the fourth the
newe made knightes. At the fyft the knyghtes
and ſquiers of honour. And by the kyng ſtode
the prince holdynge the ſworde of the churche / 
and on the other ſyde the Conſtable with the
ſworde of iuſtyce / and a lytell aboue the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall
with the ceptour / and at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kynges borde
ſate two archbyſſhops and .xvii. byſſhoppes.
And in the myddes of the dyner there came in
a knight / who was called Dinereth all armed
vpon a good horſe rychely aparelled / and had
a knyght before hym bearyng his ſpeare / and
his ſworde by his ſyde and his dagger. The
knyght toke the kyng a lybell / the whiche was
red. Therin was conteyned that there were
outher knight / ſquyer / or any other ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tylman
that <abbr>wold</abbr> ſay that kyng Henry was nat right
full kyng / he was there redy to fyght with him
in that quarell / before the kynge / or where as
it ſhulde pleaſe hym to apoynte. that byll was
cryed by an haraulde in ſyxe places of the hall
and in the towne. There was none that wolde
chalenge hym. Whan the kynge had dyned he
toke wyne &amp; ſpyces in the hall / and than went
in to his chambre. Than euery man departed
and went to their lodginges. thus the day paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
of kynge Henryes coronacyon with great
ioy and feeſt / whiche endured all the next day.
The erle of Salyſbury was nat at this ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyte
for he was in ſure priſon / and the kinges
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle and dyuers other noble men / and the
<pb facs="tcp:22067:330"/>
londoners / wolde that his heed ſhulde haue
ben ſtryken of openly in chepe / for ſaid he
had well deſerued it / for bearynge of letters
and crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fro Rycharde of Burdeaux to the
frenche kyng / and there to reporte openly that
kyng Henry was a falſe traytoure / whiche
faute they ſayd ought nat to be ꝑdoned. Kyng
Henry was more gentyll than ſo / for he had
ſome pytie on hym / for therle excuſed hym and
ſayd / that he dyd / was by the kynges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement / 
&amp; by the ſettyng on of the four knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
that were beheeded. Kinge Henry beleued
well the erles wordes / but his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle wolde
nat beleue it / but ſaid / and ſo dyd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> londoners
that he ſhulde dye / bycauſe he had deſerued

Holande erle of Huntyngdon capytayne
of Calais / was well enfourmed of the hole ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter / 
and howe his brother kyng Rychard was
taken and in priſone in the towre of London / 
and had reſygned his crowne and all / &amp; howe
Henry of Lancaſtre was kinge of Englande.
This erle of Huntyngdon / what ſo euer dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure

yet wyſely he conſydred the tyme and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures / 
and ſawe well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was nat able to with
ſtande all the power and puyſſaunce of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme.
Alſo the counteſſe his wyfe / who was co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyn
germayne to kynge Henry / ſayd. Syr / it
muſt behoue you to paſſe your diſpleaſure pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyently

requyre you and I cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle you to dyſſimule

do to you &amp; to your chyldren great good. The
erle herde well the wordes of his wyfe and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leued
her and enclyned hym to kynge Henry / 
and offred hym humble obeyſaunce / and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſed
hym faythe and trouthe. The kyng re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
hym and had great ioy therof / and he
dyd ſo moche with meanes of his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / that
therle of Salyſbury was taken to grace / and
his excuſacyons accepted / and was clene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>

So they of Burdeloys made great lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyons /

They of London aunſwered lyke theym that

the whiche they are nat nowe acuſtomed vnto
whiche ſhulde be a harde thyng nowe for them

Many thynges they promyſed and ſware to
ſeale / and to kepe for euer. They aunſwered / 
whan they were retourned agayne in to their

and ſo take counſayle and than gyue anſwere.
Thus they departed fro Dagen and fro the

the ſayde cyties conſydred the buſyneſſe / and
knewe well howe the realme of Fraunce was
vexed and troubled with tayles and fowages

they ſayd / if the frenche men gouerne ouer vs
they wyll bringe vs to the ſame vſage / yet it is
better for vs to be englyſſhe / for they kepe vs
franke and free. If the londoners haue depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
kynge Rycharde &amp; crowned kinge Henry
what is that to vs? we haue and ſhall haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a kynge / and we vnderſtande that the

ſhortely wyll be here / they ſhall enfourme vs of
the trouthe / we haue alſo more marchaundyſe
of woll / wyne / and clothe with the Englyſſhe
men than with the frenchmen. let vs be ware
we make no treatie / wherby we ſhulde repent
vs after. Thus the treatie with the frenche
men was broken and lefte of. Than anone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the byſſhop of London and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde Percy
with their charge of men of warre aryued at
Burdeaux / wherof moche people were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

them to haue tourned frenche.</p>
            <p>THan it was determyned by the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayle
of Fraunce / ſithe the kyng was

was apoynted ſyr Charles de la Brethe

And he came to Coloygne where he
was crowned with the crowne of Almayne / 
for they of Ayes wolde nat open their towne

And they dyde ſo moche by the meanes of ſir
