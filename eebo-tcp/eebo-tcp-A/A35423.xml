         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
DECLARATION
Of the Right Honourable, Henry
Earle of Cumberland, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>FRom the deep sence of the growing miseries which have
formerly afflicted this distressed coontry, and out of the
grievous apprehension of those inevitable ruines, and deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
with a reall War fomented, hatched, and brought forth
by our continuall distractions, must infallibly bring upon us; We
thought it the least of our duty to our God, our King, and our
country, to endeavour all means possible to discharge our selves
before God and Man, and to leave nothing unattempted which
might avert and prevent those fearfull calamities which as it
must be consequently the most bloudy and ruineous) was
of all others; and therefore in pursuance of that due affection to
our Native Country; We first prevailed with our most gracious
Sovereigne, whose Royal Inclination met our humble desires,
in the most ready wayes, and apparent meanes which we could
devise and finde out for the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace and safety thereof, and set
aside all other respects, though never so much conducing to the
main of His owne affaires, for our security; and therefore carried
a way the fatall Cloud of War, which in a hideous form hung
over our heads, to disburden it selfe in another Clymate, so as
we conceived, we had no further worke of labour, but to pay
the duties of prayse and thankfulnesse to our God and King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whose grace and goodnesse had freed us from the visible conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of a great and terrible tempest, but since it hath pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d
<pb facs="tcp:46656:2"/>
the unsearchable Wisedome of Almighty God so to order
it, That another storme hath broken and powred a great part of
it upon this Country (when we least feared, and by those means
which we least suspected) and that contrary to all expectation
work our misery) there appeared those out of our owne Bowels,
which have begun a War and kindled a flame, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
the ruine and destruction of their Native Country; which
we take as a Punishment due to our manifold sins and offennes,
and leave the particuler executioners thereof, to His owne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Iustice hereafter, yet we haue not been a wanting to
the safety and protection of this People (so long, and in so many
wayes afflicted, but have appolyed our selves to all such wayes
and means, which in Humane reason we could hope might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a timely remedy to those bleeding wounds. And therefore
in a Treaty at <hi>Rodwell,</hi> with some Gentlemen of this County, of
whose affection to peace and Vnity (though differing in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from us) we were most confident: Sundry Articles were a
greed and Concluded upon, all wholly tending to those ends,
and conducing to reall settlement, which was sought after by us
with so much candor plaine dealing, and earnestnesse, that we
willingly let passe the manifest advantages which we then had
over the opposers of the setled Peace of this County, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the affections of others by our own desires and inclinations,
declined and quitted all other considerations, but such as might
parchase a good correspondence and amity with those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and others, whom at that time it lay in our Power to have
forced or destroyed; and that nothing might be awanting to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them, sett at Liberty sundry Prisoners, some of good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
upon their word and Faith, to returne them againe if the
Treaty were not preformed; and condescended to all the World
knows That we aymed at the Publique safety &amp; assurance: Yet
not withstanding all this, without the least breach on our behalfe,
particuler passions and interests hath so far prevailed, That as,
soone as they were freed of the danger wherein they were then
engaged, contrary to their <hi>Hands, Faith</hi> and <hi>protestations,</hi> they
have wholly broken that Agreement so solemnly concluded,
&amp; without rendring the least reason (which indeed is impossible
and of which they can never excuse themselves) have with
<pb facs="tcp:46656:3"/>
indirect intentions; and by a specious of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er of Peace (which it
seems was the least of their thoughts) strengthned, and prepraed
themselves for War, by pretence of safety to the County, disvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oped
themselves from danger, and procured security to their
own persons, and by a seeming desire to stop the deluge of War
(began by them alone) opened a breach to all the miseries &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
which must now most invitable overwhelm this distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Country; whereby before the utmost extrimity hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we have already suffered what can befall any people (setting
aside, firing Townes and Villages) by the Hand of a cruell and
Forraigne enemy; Strangers brought in to oppresse us, our houses
plundred, goods destroyed and taken away, our housholds disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
Wives and children banished, the persons of divers of us sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and Imprisoned, our lives endangered, and sought after, by
Sword or Famine; (and what is beyond all beleife) those who
are unquestionably innocent, and in no capacity to be involved
in our pretended offences (if we be guilty of any) our Children
(even those whose Infant yeares admit no colour of objection)
our Servants (employed only in domestick, commands) sought
after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and indangered in the same measure and degree of cruelty,
violence, and oppression. And that no aggravation may be a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to encrease our sufferings, all those exorbitances executed
under the glorious pretences of safety of Religion and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of State, and done by Authority and command of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(which we acknowledge and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>leive to be the Guard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>an of
Publique liberty) and who we are confident being chosen by us
for assertors of our Freedoms, will not enthrale us; being trusted
with the property of our goods, wil not take them from us; being
selected for the preservation of our Laws, will not violate or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe
them; and that in so high a measure, as more could not be
perpetrated, if we were conquered and subdued by the most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and violent Enemy. We have heard and do beleive, That
both the Houses have commanded the <hi>Militia</hi> to be setled &amp; that
they think it necessary, for some reasons (best knowne to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
that the power which untill this time, hath bin unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
in the Kings of this land, shold now be setled in themselves
yet these admitted, we cannot be perswaded, That it is the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or meaning of the Parliament, that all who are not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb facs="tcp:46656:3"/>
of the necessity, or who cannot dispence with their
Oathes, which tyes them to the knowne Lawes of the Land
till they be repealed, and to obey His Maiesties command in
those things wherein it appears Hee hath manifest Right, untill
He hath given a way and parted with that Right by His own
assent, or who are yet Newters, and conscionably, expect a
legall Rule whereby to be directed, should presently with out
due processe of Law, be devested from all property of Goods,
Liberty of persons, Lives and Fortunes, and be in a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for not performing what is it no Law, then any Man can
be for offending and disobeyng all the Lawes which were ever
yet established: and much lesse, that the friends and servants, the
faulty and guiltlesse, those whose condition or inability free
them from assisting in, or, exercising any <hi>Militia,</hi> Clergy-men,
Babes, Old Men, women, should be included and wrapped up
in one common fate and destruction, contrary to the rules of
God and nature; which make a large differene between the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and the offender, and the customs and Laws of this Realme,
which give freedome to diverse in those cases and have so long
maintained this Kingdom in peace, by distributing rewards and
punishments (not to all a like) but to the conscionably obedient,
or wilfull contemners thereof. These distructive courses of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
pretending necessity, were ever opposed when they were
executed by Regall power, deferred &amp; protested against by his
Sacred <hi>Maiesty,</hi> altogether condemned by former, and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Parliament, and not to be done or consented to by any, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
disobedience to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> offence to the Parliament, and
injury to the Freedom and Liberty if this people and Kingdom.
But wee are farre from believing these to be the command and
Acts of an English Parliament, which our selves have so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desired, so faithfully supported; but rather of some persons,
who (being now) contrary to their hopes, armed with power
to gaine the affections of their Souldiers for farther ends and
designes, and to make their particular profit by the generall
spoyle, give way to this licentiousnesse, and suffer them to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
persons and destroy the goods of the innocent people, and
to make havocke and spole of all which comes in their way, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
loose the Raines of government, and giving way to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of rapine (though the gaine on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

countervaile the losse on the other) to the unspeakeable detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and dammage of this our flourishing, now miserable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
By which courses it hath beene already endammaged (as
we offer to make good) to the value of 100000 pound, besides
the sufferance of many such barbarous outrages, scarce credible
to be committed by Christians; and those so frequent, that if
possible, they can bee denyed; and that the Houses will admit
the proofe, we shall make them appeare in such numbers, and so
abhominable, will exceed the beliefe of any, unlesse they see
them sufficiently witnessed and attested. Out of our desire of
peace, we have already endured beyond mortall sufferance, and
are ready to suffer still in our owne particulars; and to set apart
all Interests of our owne, and to expose our selves to the height
of violence and rigour though undeserved (unlesse to obey our
King according to His Laws be an offence) before wee will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the peace of this County, and this people, for any regard
or respect whatsoever. And therefore because as our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
do speciously pretend, That their Armes are raised only for
seizing upon Delinquents, and bringing them to condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
or driving them out of the Country (which is their
baite to catch the multitude.) We do unanimously professe and
declare (although we are confident, and that their practises <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hew
that whosoever hath mony or Plate, or Moveables, is a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and must part with them ere he be guiltles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) to take away
all scruples, if they will set down and expresse the names of the
delinquents (if any be amongst us) and their offences, upon assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that no other end is sought by their Armes; and that once
obtained, they wil absolutely lay them down, and free the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
it shall be manifested, That we will not decline any just and
legall tryall, or desire that a war should be continued, or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
disturb'd for the safeguard of them, or any of them: although
we are most assured, that when by the tearme of Delinquency,
they have quit their hands of such, who are most likely to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the ruinous proceedings, that others whose wealth, estates,
or former actions unpleasing to these men, have made them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious,
shall succeed in the same misery; and very many, who
suppose themselves in a good condition of grace and favour with
them, shall fall into the like misfortune, as soone as the Lion sees
<pb facs="tcp:46656:4"/>
fit time to discover his hidden Clawes; it being impossible they
should be in a better estate of Innocency, then our selves, who
have not at all wilfully offended, or opposed any of the knowne
Lawes of this Kingdom. We have had wofull and sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the more our Adversaries are sought unto for peace,
the farther they are estranged from it; and that all lenitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
doe but exasperate our disease. We doe protest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and man, That wee will yet apply our selves to all
meanes which may conduce to quiet, and settlement; but in the
meane time will really and effectually labour for the safety of
this Country, our selves, our wives, and children; and if for the
preservation of all, that ought to be defended, and maintained
by Mortall Man: we are necessitated and compelled by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to call in Forces, and desire the Assistance of the Earle of
Newcastle, and of our friends and Neighbours in the adjacent
Counties (being of our own nation, and whose turne is next, and
cause the same with ours, and that thereby some unforeseene or
unwished accident arise, not then to be remedied, and that York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire

can justly now say, we have freed our owne soules, discharged
the duty of Christians, Englishmen, Patriates, and have bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
in all: so as there remaines no more, but to defend our
Country from Strangers, our lives from violence, our Wives
and children from extremity of injury, our Houses from Rapine,
our goods from spoyle, our Laws, liberties, property, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is or can bee neere or deare unto us, from utmost hazard
and destruction. In execution or which resolution, there is no
course or means omitted, which may (as far as is possible) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the benefit and preservation of the people. The Earle of
Newcastle required assurance before he would march to our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
that the Country should be payed the billet of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
which was before thought upon, and resolved by us, and
caution is accordingly given; so that no man will receive losse
<pb facs="tcp:46656:5"/>
or dammage by those forces, as far as it is in our power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
or foresee. And because they have hitherto built up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon false reports and foundations, and disguise and make
the truth according as it may best fit their ends, and serve their
purposes; and thereby not onely perswade the people with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
rumours of his Majesties unfortunate proceedings (when
in truth God hath wonderfully blessed him with most fortunate
successe) but also casting false lights before their eyes, lay scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
aspersions upon our actions and reall intendments, for the
benefit of this County, striving to possesse them with a prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of whatsoever we go about to do; &amp; accordingly are now
seeking to poyson the minds of the people with a false opinion,
and causelesse jealousie, That the Army now comming to our
assistance, is assigned for the oppression, not deliverance; the
destruction, not safegard of the Country; and will be the ruine
of it wheresoever they passe. To stop the poysonous mouthes
of malice it selfe, the Earle of New-Castle hath declared his
honourable Intentions, to leave the Country in peace, as soone
as he hath delivered it from these enemies of His Majesty, who
now oppresse and tyrannise over it. In which endeavour wee
doubt not, to find the reall concurrence of all who have interest
in this County, and that they will not be behind their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and Allyes in seeking their owne preservations, being all
owners of one common cause, and must (what ever pretences be
made) in the end, runne the same course of violence and disola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How ever, though we perish in this work, we shall rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that we have preserved our Faith and Honour untainted:
and if all other disert us in this resolution, wee will not faile our
selves, nor our duty to our King and Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein appeares
so much Iustice and Piety: but are most confident by Gods
blessing upon the performance of our just endeavours, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the enemies of His Majesties peace, and to conserve our
selves and this Country, to the Glory of God, the service of our
King, and mutuall comfort of one another.</p>
