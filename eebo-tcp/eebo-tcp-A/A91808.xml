            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have heard in the concluſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> the promiſe of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance made by God unto the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and in them, to all his choſen, that their enemies ſhould be overthrown, and they reſtored to their ancient inheritance which ſhould be performed by Saviours, which ſhould come up to mount <hi>Sion</hi> to judge the mount of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and that the kingdome ſhould bee the Lords, which that you might ſee how it was in ſhaddow, performed to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and in truth to all the choſen of God, I thought good to entreat of this Propheſie of <hi>Haggai,</hi> wherein the ſame is delivered unto us. In which we are taught, that the Temple having been begun to be built long before, and the worke intermitted, was with much adoe continued by <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> and <hi>Jehoſua,</hi> who were thereunto moved by the miniſtery of

                  <hi>Haggai,</hi> proſpered by the aſſiſtance of the godly, encouraged by Gods word, and grace of his ſpirit, which repreſenteth un o us <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 6.</note> the frame of the ſpirituall houſe, the Church which Chriſt built by his Apoſtles, which were ſent from <hi>Sion</hi> as was propheſied of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9, 10.</note> them. <hi>The doctrine ſhall come from Sion.</hi> Next if we conſider the circumſtances of the times, letts, helps, the perſons, people, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Preiſts, dealings, it may be an example unto us, and to ſuch <note place="margin">Iſa. 2. 2.

Moreover by the conſequence that once more <hi>he would ſhake the heavens and the earth, bring the deſire of all nations, and fill that houſe with glory,</hi> he comprehendeth the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling <note place="margin">Hag 2. 6, 7</note> of all his promiſes made to his church in Chriſt Jeſus, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he layeth downe the everlaſting deſtruction of the heathen. when he ſheweth that he will <hi>deſtroy the throne of kingdomes, and the ſtrength of the kingdome of the heathen, &amp;c.</hi> and ſet <hi>Zerubbabell</hi> (that is Chriſt of whom he was a ſigne) <hi>as a ſignet, for I have</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Prophet, firſt by commiſſion from God reprooveth the people for neglecting the building of the Temple, convincing them of ſloath, which he doth, partly, by rebuking the care which they tooke, every man in building his owne houſe, and partly, by the Chaſtiſements which God had for their ſinnes laid upon them. This that we may underſtand the better, we are to remember out of the 4. of <hi>Ezra,</hi> that whereas by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Ezr. 4. 1, 2 3, 4, 5.</note> of <hi>Cyrus</hi> they had laid the foundation of the Temple in his dayes, the building of the Temple, was hindred by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the land, who diſcouraged the Jewes, troubled them in building, and hired accuſers to accuſe them to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſo that in the dayes of <hi>Ahaſhueroſh,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> they were ſtayed for going forward, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> decreeing that they ſhould ceaſe. When <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was dead, and <hi>Darius</hi> reigned in his <note place="margin">Ezr. 4. 21. 24.</note> ſtead, they ceaſed alſo from the worke, pretending that having<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beene often forbid before by <hi>Cambiſes</hi> and <hi>Darius Hiſtaſpis,</hi> and not receiving any licence from the new King, they might either be hindred as before, or accuſed of Treaſon for breaking the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117070:5"/>
former Kings commandement; and laſtly, that it was not yet time to doe it. The Prophet in the 1 verſe noteth diligently the time, the yeare, the moneth, and day when he received this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God. In the 2 he propoſeth their fault, which in the 4 verſe he reproveth, both which are uttered by mentioning the meſſenger, with the commandement of God in the 3 verſe; and in the 1 verſe the two perſons by whom chiefly the worke was to be ſet forward, the times are eſpecially noted, to ſhew what juſt cauſe the Lord had to reprove them, having ſo long neglected his will, and the juſt cauſe of puniſhing them for their neglect.</p>
               <p>In the reproofe we may note 5 things. Firſt, the time when this commandement was given to the Prophet. Secondly, the Author thereof, the Lord. Thirdly, the perſons by whom the thing was to be done. Fourthly, the fault that was committed by them, they ſaid the time was not yet come. Fiftly, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe it ſelfe, <hi>Is it time for you Sirs?</hi> Which circumſtances, as they are firſt to be conſidered of us, ſo ſhall wee make our beſt profit by them, if wee compare our Church with theirs: For as the Jewes were long in bondage in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but at length were brought back by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> ſo our Anceſtors were held long under <note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 22, 23.</note> the bondage of the ſpirituall ſlavery of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is ſpirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> whence by the meanes of <hi>H.</hi> 8. as they by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> they were <note place="margin">Ezra. 1. 1, 2, 3. Revel. 18. 2. 21.</note> delivered. The Jewes being reſtored, laid the foundation of the Temple, but were not able to goe further by reaſon of enemies that procured them diſpleaſure with the Kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi> God hath dealt more graciouſly with us, to whom hee hath granted gracious Princes to ſet forward this worke; yet notwithſtanding are not wee ſo forward as they: For, whereas they had laid the whole foundation in the dayes of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> we in many places have not laid that: For what is the foundation that is firſt to be laid? The Apoſtle teacheth, even the Doctrine of the beginnings of Chriſt: as the Doctrine of repentance from dead workes, and of <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1. 2</note> Faith towards God; the Doctrine of Baptiſmes. Now how farre the people are from theſe things in many places, wee may heare of thoſe that ſpeake out of experience; for ſundry there are, who when they heare tell of theſe things, wonder at them, as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> did at <hi>Paul,</hi> and mervaile what ſo ſtrange doctrine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; which is a lamentable thing, confidering how mercifully <note place="margin">Act. 17. 18 20.</note> God hath dealt with the Churches elſewhere. And as it is ſaid by the Prophet, <hi>He hath cauſed it to raine upon one City, and not <note place="margin">Amo. 4. 7. 8.</note>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:117070:6"/>

               <p>Many there are againe, which have ſtayed at the foundation, but have not held on to build the walls, they have not been led on to perfection, and inſtructed in the wiſedome of Chriſt.

I am loath to move this ſinke any more, therefore I leave it to the conſideration of that which hath beene ſaid; how neceſſary it is to lay the roofe upon the building, to preſerve the worke, and to keepe out the ſnow and raine, that is, all manner of vices that hurt and injure the Building, and cannot otherwayes than hereby bee redreſſed; as idleneſſe, riotouſneſſe, drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, which for want hereof ſwarme among us, not onely to the diſcomfort of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117070:7"/>
Gods ſervants, but alſo to the deſtruction of them that are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred with them: So then if we compare our Church with that Temple of the Jewes, we ſee that in ſome places the foundation is not yet laid, in ſome the walls not built, finally that the Roofe yet wanteth to the perfecting of the work, which I would the rather wiſh you to marke, For that through the whole Propheſie, I will ſpeake nothing but what ſhall neceſſarily apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to ſome part hereof. Now let us come to conſider the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and firſt the time. It is ſaid <q>
                     <hi>in the ſecond yeare of Darius, in the ſixt moneth, in the firſt day of the moneth,</hi>
                  </q> who this <hi>Darius</hi> was there is ſome difference in judgments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the learned, ſome thinke it to be <hi>Hiſtaſpis</hi> ſome <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> &amp;c. But not to ſtand upon the refutation of thoſe opinions, or naming of them that were of that minde (who are ratherto be commended for their diligence, in laboring to find out the truth, than reproved for not meeting with it) I will ſet downe that which ſeemeth beſt to agree with the courſe of the Scripture, and verity of the Hiſtory. It ſeemeth therefore that <hi>Darius</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was he that was ſurnamed <hi>Nothus,</hi> the baſtard, as may be gathered by the fourth and ſeventh chapters of <hi>Ezra,</hi> in the fourth chapter it is ſaid that <hi>Artaxerxes, who for had the building of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezra 4. 5. 11. 24. Ezra 7. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the Temple, reigned before Darius,</hi> in the ſeventh it is ſaid, <hi>after the death of Darius in the raigne of Artaxerxes, the Jewes had leave by him to build the Temple.</hi> This then muſt be that <hi>Darius</hi> which came between the two <hi>Artaxerxes:</hi> of whom the former was ſurnamed <hi>Longimanus,</hi> father to this <hi>Darius,</hi> and the other <hi>Mnemon,</hi> who was his ſonne, ſo that it appeareth by the courſe of the Hyſtory written by <hi>Ezra,</hi> that this <hi>Darius</hi> was he whom Hyſtories call <hi>Darius Nothus, Darius</hi> the Baſtard. Now from the time of <hi>Cyrus</hi> king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> when the foundation began firſt to be laid, unto <note place="margin">Ezra 3. 10.</note> the raigne of this <hi>Darius</hi> is accounted of ſome 100. yeares, but becauſe it was a cuſtome amongſt them when their Kings went to warre to appoint their ſonnes kings in their roome, it cometh to paſſe that the ſame yeares may be accounted in the reigne of the ſonne, which are in the fathers, as <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> is ſaid to have reigned 62 yeares, whereas he reigned 18 yeares before his father died: wherefore happily the number of thoſe yeares was leſſe, than that number. But ſuppoſe it were 80 or 60, and if you will ſomewhat above fourtie as the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſeemed to have received by tradition, when they ſaid in the Goſpell 46. <hi>years was this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Joh. 2. 20.</note>

in building.</hi> It was a long time no doubt from the laying of the foundation to the perfecting of the work. Which may be a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the godly and zealous Preachers of Gods Word, not to be diſcouraged, though all things ſucceed not according to their deſire and hope, and not to faint in their miniſtery, taking for their example the Prophet, who, though the word had ceaſed a long time, yet was not diſcouraged, deſpairing that his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would take no ſucceſſe. <hi>Rome</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>was not built in one day:</hi> No mervaile then if Jeruſalem be not; for it is eaſier and ſooner done to build the Tower of Babylon, than the Tower of Sion; the Chappell of the Devill, than the Church of God; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as deſire, and wiſh for building of the Church, are not in any caſe to caſt away all hope, though things be not done with expedition: For if wee conſider the times, there are no more yeares paſſed ſince the laying of the foundation among us, than theſe which were paſt from the reigne of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the time of <hi>Darius.</hi> Wherefore as the Prophet and other godly perſons did, let us alſo wait the good leiſure of our God, continuing each one in his calling to further the worke, and pray unto God that hee would ſtirre up the ſpirit of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Iehoſhua;</hi> that is, all ſuch as be put in authority to perfect this holy worke.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Darius</hi> was not for his civill behaviour, ſo vertuous a Prince as many of his Predeceſſors, but noted to bee faulty in ſundry things, yet did he ſuffer the Jewes to build the Temple; yea, when their enemies accuſed them, he cauſed the monuments to be ſearched, and found out the grant of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which hee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; giving them beſides out of the Kings Revenues money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Ezr. 6. 1. 8.</note> their expences; yet this <hi>Darius</hi> that dealt with them ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly, did marry his Fathers Siſter; through perjury deprived his elder Brother of the Kingdome, and put him to a moſt cruell death, as <hi>Cteſias,</hi> who lived in his dayes hath written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt that naughty Jeſuite <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

I will not ſpeake any thing of the perſons, what a man, what a child, what a woman, let us ſuppoſe they were defiled more than any ſlanderous perſon can ſay, yet that hindreth nothing but that they might ſet forward and promote the truth, and God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For even <hi>Darius,</hi> an inceſtuous perſon, perjured, ye even a murtherer of his owne Brother, ſet forward the building of the Temple, yet it was no diſcredit to the worke, nor to the godly that laboured with all their might therein. No man can be a diſcredit to the Goſpell, neither doth the truth of Chriſts religion depend upon the perſon of each one of them by whom it pleaſeth God to proſper it. <hi>Solomon</hi> the beſt King, even hee that <note place="margin">1 King. 11 7.</note> firſt built the Temple of God, did raiſe up a high place to <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For although it were partly ſent to them to ſtirre them up (as the godly are ſlow inough) yet becauſe the fault is noted eſpecially to bee in the people (as their reproofe argueth) it ſeemeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this was ſent unto theſe Governours, chiefly for their ſakes, that the power of the Prince and Prieſt might the rather move them to goe forward in that which they had begun.

                  <hi>Thus hath the Lord of Hoaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> charged mee to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This people ſay that the time is not yet come, the time wherein the Houſe of the Lord &amp;c.</hi>

                  </gap>ly; for the cauſe was not his nakedneſſe, but his wickedneſſe, in that he had eaten of the forbidden fruit. Since which time, it hath been a cuſtome amongſt the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> to cover iniquity with hypocriſie, and cloake their offences with excuſes. As in this place, the cauſe why the people did not build the houſe of the Lord, was, that every man was wholy ſet to the building of his owne houſe; to the regard of his owne private profit and eaſe; yet laid they the cauſe on the time; <hi>The time is not yet come,</hi> the time to build the houſe of the Lord. Wherefore as it pleaſed God to deale mercifully with <hi>Adam,</hi> and to the end hee might bring him to the acknowledgement of his tranſgreſſion, demanded of him, <hi>Haſt thou eaten of the fruit?</hi> So likewiſe here he dealeth with this people, when he ſaith, <hi>Is it time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for you Sirs to ſit downe in your ſeeled houſes, while this houſe lieth waſte?</hi> Where he ſheweth the true cauſes indeed to bee not the time, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but <hi>Worldlineſſe</hi> and <hi>Idleneſſe,</hi> in that they tooke ſo great care to build and furniſh their owne houſes, and that not onely for commodity, but for pleaſure alſo; for they built their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſeeled them alſo. Idleneſſe, in that they ſate them downe to take their reſt and eaſe, for that doth the hebrew word in this place properly ſignifie. This fault therefore was ſhewed them, to the end they might acknowledge it, and amend it; that indeed their pretence for want of time was but hypocriticall, the true cauſe being their <hi>Worldlineſſe</hi> and <hi>Idleneſſe,</hi> that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their offence, repent, and in time amend it. Which fruit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that you may take hereby, it hath beene heretofore ſhewed you in the generall argument of this propheſie, in what points our eſtate may bee compared with theirs; that as it fared with them, ſo doth it with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As they were delivered from the bodily captivitie by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> So we have beene delivered from the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all captivity by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. another <hi>Cyrus:</hi> And as they, though having received a grant and commiſſion from <hi>Cyrus, &amp;c.</hi> yet built not up the materiall Temple in ſuch ſort and ſpeed as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117070:12"/>
was given them in commandment; So alſo wee have not beene ſo painefull and diligent in building up the ſpirituall Temple and Church of God. The foundation of this worke was ſaid to bee the beginnings of the doctrine of Chriſtianity, the which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1. 2</note> calleth the laying of the foundation. The raiſing of the <note place="margin">1 Pet 1. 12</note> walls is the perfect underſtanding of thoſe myſteries of Chriſt which the Angels deſire to behold. The Roofe to bee laid upon this building, to keep them that are within the houſe from the annoyance of raine and weather, of heat and blaſts; that is, from ſins and offences, is Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline; which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of the Jewes, Chriſt commanded, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles conſtituted, the Primitive Church obſerved, the Reformed have reſtored to the ſingular commodity and good governance of the places where it is received, even in the judgement of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt: By reaſon that a learned Paſtor joyned to a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">

Firſt, to admoniſh privately offenders; then, if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend not, to proceed forward &amp;c: So to keepe them from ſuch ſinnes as civill Lawes partly doe not, partly cannot puniſh, and yet are ſuch as ſhut out the committers from the Kingdome of <note place="margin">Rev. 21 27 1 Cor. 6. 10.</note> God, into which, no uncleane, adulterous, or covetous perſon can enter.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſeeing that in many places of this Land the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is not yet laid; the congregations being not catechiſed; in others, if there be catechiſing, yet no preaching, and ſo the walls not built; in others no diſcipline excerciſed, and therefore the roofe not laid upon the building. It is manifeſt that the Temple of the Lord is not built amongſt us as it ought, and ſo that our caſe and fault is like unto theirs, whom the Lord by the Prophet here reproveth, for ſo his Houſe lieth waſte among us: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where leſſe, ſomewhere more, but lye waſte it doth; not indeed as the Temple when <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed, and ſaid, thy ſanctuary lyes <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 17.</note> waſte; but as God ſaith here that it did, when there was an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar built. But is this fault defended by us, with ſuch excuſes as it was maintained by them? in ſome part no doubt it is: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">Ezra 3. 2, 3</note> I cannot ſay of this people in generall as the Prophet doth of the Jewes, for there are many that confeſſe the time to bee come to build the Lords Houſe (God increaſe the number of them) yet ſome there be that ſay the time is not yet come, as hath appeared by the open reproofe of that which in this matter I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117070:12"/>
have heretofore ſpoken unto you: Wherein firſt I would adviſe you diligently to beware that you ſtumble not at their offences, neither conceive worſe of the Church becauſe of the jarres that happen in it. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> diſagreed, yet were they of the true Church, as theſe were of whom the Prophet ſpeaketh. Hee with the Prince and high Prieſt diſſented from the people, the people thought and held that the time was not yet come to build the Houſe of the Lord; But the other were of a contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet were they of the true Church, which note alſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a fooliſh motive of our adverſaries concerning diſcord and univerſality, for here wee ſee that the greater part held the falſe opinion, and that the true Church diſſented from it ſelfe. Next let us remember who they were that ſaid, <hi>The time is not yet come,</hi> namely, the people, for even ſo they who ſay among us the time is not yet come, are of this people, of the people of God indeed, yet of the people only. For they that are in the place of <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> and <hi>Iehoſhua</hi> ſay that it is high time; in the booke of ordeining Biſhops and Miniſters, there is granted unto the Miniſter authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to preach the Word, miniſter the Sacraments, excerciſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which more at large appeareth in a learned diſcourſe of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> whence into that booke they have tranſlated that point.

               <p>Wherein firſt to you I need not ſay ſo much for the laying of the foundation, if the good order already taken for catechiſing in every houſe were diligently and carefully looked unto, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the foundation be laid yet in building the walls, there would be ſomewhat added.

                  </gap>n in all Oxford, which were a ſpeciall ſervice for the ſanctifying of that day, when there were fewer preachers among us than now there are, yet were there more ſermons than now adaies there be; ſo that it might truly be ſaid, the people is increaſed, but their joy is diminiſhed: although I nothing doubt but there would enow bee found voluntarily to performe this worke, yet thinke I it more convenient, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to continue, if the publique Readers, the Heads of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges with the Prebends of Chriſt-church will take the charge of it, that whereas now they are to preach once, they would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to doe it twice, which might be done with little increaſe of their paines, and great profit of the Univerſity. This thing I doubt not but it would bee eſtabliſhed, if it would pleaſe God to ſtirre up his ſpirit that is in the roome of the Magiſtrate to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it in the convocation, by the godly diſpoſition of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in commending it to the houſe of the Proctors to gather the voyces, and of the body of the Univerſity to agree to it.</p>
               <p>But howſoever the foundation and walls are built among us, in other places certainely they are not, for which, ſuch as doe it not, but indeed ought to doe it, are in great fault. I meane the meere non-reſident, that ſtayeth here from his charge without
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117070:13"/>
any juſt or neceſſary occaſion, whereby it commeth to paſſe that in many places of this land they are ſo farre from laying on the roofe, that the foundation is not laid. This offence is ſo great, that not the people and the Prince, but even their owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo (if they be not by Gods judgement ſeared) confeſſe that it is time to amend it, which is laid downe more plaine in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod but now alledged, wherein the Biſhops affirme this non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence to be a thing foule and unhoneſt in it ſelfe, ſhamefull and deteſtable among the people, pernicious and hurtfull to the Church of God; I doe but engliſh their owne words, <hi>foedo in ſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioſa in vulgus, pernitioſa Eccleſiae Dei.</hi> The 32. Commiſſioners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, appointed that none having the charge of ſoules elſewhere ſhould continue in the Univerſity, and no mervaile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the booke of ordering of Miniſters, each one at the time of his ordering ſolemnly promiſeth before God and his elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to give all diligence, to teach his people with all care, &amp;c. Which booke being eſtabliſhed againe, ſuch as are ordered, being made by this order, yet abide many of them among us breaking this ſolemne promiſe and vow to almighty God, and yet are not aſhamed to looke men in the faces, as though God had not ſaid, performe thy vowes, and that he delighteth not in fools, &amp;c. yet we, for all they be ſuch men, honour them, beſtow graces on them, give them great commendation of learning and honeſty, whereas by this breaking of their vow and promiſe they declare themſelvs to be ſacrilegious perſons. A great fault in us <hi>regentes,</hi> if not alſo in <hi>non regentes:</hi> if we have not learned that this is a ſufficient cauſe to deny graces, but grant them to ſuch perſons, to the ſhame and obloquie of the Univerſity. And here I am ſorry that I cannot touch this fault, but that I muſt you alſo (Reverend Fathers) who although you be called to the ſame office and duty that the others be, yet are not in the ſame meaſure of ſin that they are; howbeit theſe are ſtrengthened in their offence by your example. Let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke that when we ſpeake of this fault to have it redreſſed, that we caſt daggers into our Fathers boſomes, but let them conſider the cauſe that moveth us thus to doe. In the Perſian ſtory written by <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Trogus,</hi> wee read that after the death of <hi>Cambiſes,</hi> the <hi>Magi</hi> got the Crowne, ſeven of the Nobility conſpired toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſlay the <hi>Magi:</hi> and as <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Gobrias</hi> made at one of them, <hi>Darius</hi> ſtaying to ſtrike, <hi>Gobrias</hi> asked what he meant that he ſlew not his enemy, for feare (ſaith he) leſt in the darke I ſlay
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117070:14"/>
thee; to whom <hi>Gobrias</hi> anſwered, ſtay not for that, but hartily run us both through. <hi>Gobrias</hi> was content, if it could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be done, that himſelfe ſhould be ſlaine, ſo that the ſorcerer, the uſurper might die alſo. Some thinke you ſhould bee content that we ſtrike you, if no otherwiſe, that theſe ſorcerers may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. I call them ſo juſtly, for God hath ſaid that diſobedience is as the ſinne of ſorcerie. This ſinne of non-reſidence is a ſinne of diſobedience, and a mother of as many traſgreſſions as ever was Sodome. Bee content therefore if to the end, to ſlay them, wee touch your bodies and credit, ſeeing it may be that as the ſorcerer was ſlaine, and <hi>Gobrias</hi> eſcaped; ſo you may eſcape though they be ſlaine. Would to God we might ſee your diligence to caſt out theſe ſorcerers as <hi>Saul</hi> did out of Iſrael, and ſo to caſt them out, as withall to take heed that you follow not his example who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards went himſelfe to conſult with a ſocereſs with one that had a familiar ſpirit, becauſe that God anſwered him not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, this was a perſwaſible reaſon to fleſh and bloud, God doth not anſwer me, therefore why may I not aske of a witch? and ſhall not yours be like if you thus gather? God doth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe provide for mee, therefore will I robbe Churches, &amp;c. But how farre from this minde was St. Paul, and how farre from his are ſuch men? he was content rather to betake himſelfe to a baſe occupation, wherein hee had been before trayned up, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would but then the Churches; which he might nevertheleſs <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 6. 8. 9.</note> have done lawfully: and better were it for you to return again to the teaching of Schollars, than to provide for yourſelves by ſuch meanes, though I hope you ſhall not need to doe that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: God having provided that you may live honeſtly by other meanes if you can be content to beare a lower ſaile remembring the heathen mans rule <hi>Ingens vectigal parſimonia.</hi> Abraham, when God called him, forſooke a fruitfull and plentifull ſoyle, to go he knew not whither. <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the children of God than to enjoy the delights of Egypt.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117070:14"/>
muſt be content to forgoe them, Chriſt ſaith he is not worthy to be his diſciple, who forſaketh not all even his owne life to follow him: will you not be content to forgoe theſe things for his ſake who for yours did forgoe his owne bloud? no doubt if we would earneſtly regard &amp; reprove theſe things here, it would move godly Patrons to ſend hither for able and fit men to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their roome, or God would move her Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> to procure that better order may be taken in this caſe, that it may not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for patrons to preferre ſuch beggarly creatures as often they doe the very filth and raſcality of the people, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Concerning the laſt point, which is the ſetting up of the roofe upon the building, let us remember the commandement of Chriſt, If our Brother treſpaſſe againſt us to tell him his fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and him, and if he heare thee not doe it before two or three, if he vouchſafe not to hear them, to tell it unto the Church, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he refuſe to heare, to count him as a heathen, let us conſider one another to provoke to love and to good works, and uſe all meanes to recall ſinners from their ungodlineſſe to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe let us joyne one to another in this worke as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gal.</hi> joyneth himſelfe with all the brethren, and to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> with <hi>Timotheus</hi> and <hi>Silvanus,</hi> as <hi>Barnabas</hi> joyned himſelfe to <hi>Silas,</hi> &amp;c. ſo let us joyne together our ſtrength and uſe one anothers helpe to the forwarding of Sincerity, In which reſpect I thought it neceſſary to ſpeake of this matter at this time and in this place, for though it may ſeeme that it were fitter to be delivered in other places yet it is not amiſſe alſo here, for there are many here that may come to thoſe places, and therefore it is neceſſary they ſhould know the truth of this doctrine: there are ſome here that may ſtand before the Prince as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did before <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where it may be ſaid that the Vniverſities are not ſufficient to ſend forth ſo many as may furniſh the land, it is true indeed, where it lieth on them that are in authority to ſet forward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing ordered by the 32 Commiſſioners before mentioned who mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> three Seminaries which ſhould ſerve for this purpoſe whereof the one is the Vniverſity, another Biſhops houſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they appoint that men ſhould be trained up in learning that they may be fit for ſuch charges to which end they required that the Biſhops keep no idle perſons in their houſes but that (beſides their neceſſary ſervants) all about them ſhould be brought up in

ſuffered, and leaſt they might imagine, that albeit they ſuffered theſe things yet happilie they might come from ſome other cauſes and not from God, hee bringeth in the Lord proteſting ſo much <hi>(I did blow upon it)</hi> or if they would ſuppoſe that albeit it were the hand of God; yet that it might come for ſome other cauſe than this, it is alſo added <hi>all this came on them becauſe of his houſe, that was waſte while every man rann to his owne houſe.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of the exhortation whereby he inciteth them to continue the building of the Lords houſe, which they had ſo long neglected, wherefore they were puniſhed of God by ſcarcity and need in their goods, and by want of ſtrength in their bodies.</p>
               <p>The firſt point to be noted is that the Prophet ſaieth nothing unto the people but what the Lord hath given him in charge, for which cauſe he doth ſo often put them in minde that <hi>this is the word of the Lord,</hi> for both the exhortation in the 5. and 7. verſes have the ſame annexed, and the two reaſons adjoyned to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them in the 8. and 9. verſes, wherein he ſheweth himſelfe a wiſe and faithfull ſteward in diſpenſing the myſteries of God: faithfull, in that he goeth not beyond his charge, wiſe, in that he faſteneth the thing which hee would teach them the more deeply in their mindes, by ſundry repetitions.

fourth, neither was that place left without a man while there remained any hope to do good: there hath been a fire kindled to conſume this hold of ſinne, God forbid it ſhould be quenched, nay it cannot indeed, for it is nouriſhed by Gods ſpirit. The Papiſts themſelves at their councell of Trent, after they had long debated the matter, they were enforced by the clearneſſe of the truth to conclude, That the Paſtor by the law of God is bound to be reſident on his charge, what the law of man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, it is for the heardnes of mens hearts, whereunto that may be replyed, that from the beginning it was not ſo; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although we be ſhot through with ſpeeches as ſharpe as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, yet let us ſhew ourſelves no leſſe valiant than did the Citizens of <hi>Avaricum,</hi> chiefly ſeing they fought but for a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible City for the ſafguard of the body, and that with uncertaine hope: but we fight for an incorruptible crowne of glory, for the eternall ſalvation of the ſoule, and that under undoubted hope. But we perſwade our ſelves better things of you brethren, whom we deſire to remember that the wounds of a freind is better than the kiſſes of an enemy. Of my ſelfe I know, and I conceive the the like of others, that I onely reprove this ſinne for the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your ſoules, and of them that are committed to your charge: and why the ſame is done ſo often we have example and warrant of the Prophet uſing ſo many iterations of the ſame thing, and of the good Chyrurgeons, who ceaſe not to apply their medicines till ſuch time as they have cured the wound.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed, the exhortation is laid down in the 8 verſe <hi>Goe up to the mountaine and bring wood and build this houſe,</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hereof are becauſe the Lord had already corrected them, ver. 6, 9. 10, 11, Where, as he threatneth them puniſhment if they do it not, ſo on the other ſide he promiſeth that he will take pleaſure in them, &amp;c. verſ. 8 and beſtow his bleſſing on them if they do his commandement: but for that you have heard ſufficiently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the exhortation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will come to the reaſons.

Pulſe is but a homely meate, and by the Phyſitians judgement but of a bad Juyce yet with Gods bleſſing it is better than a Prinoes fare; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe without this when the people looked for much it came to little, and when it was brought home the Lord blowed upon it and it diſperſed and vaniſhed as it had been nothing, they dranke but were not filled, they did eat but were not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, put on clothes but were not warmed, becauſe theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wanted that ſecret bleſſing, by which God giveth force to the clothes to warme, bread to nouriſh, drink to quench the thirſt: as when he pleaſeth, he ſometimes taketh away the things themſelves, in both to teach us to caſt up our eyes from the earth to heaven, from the the creature to the creator, which let us do and when ſuch things befalls us, Remember the ſpeech of <hi>Job,</hi> who when his goods were ſpoyled, &amp;c.

this of them all, that when they cry to him out of their diſtreſſe he heareth them and helpeth; as he did <hi>Ionah</hi> out of the Whales belly: this ſhould we conſider to be the cauſe of warres and other chaſtiſements and not refer them (as ſome are wont) to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of the Sunne or Moone, or conjunction of ſome planetts, or to the ſextile or quadrate aſpect of them: No: plagues, warres, ſickneſſe, famine, they are not effects of theſe cauſes, the eclipſe is in us, not in the Sunne or Moon that cauſeth theſe things: It is for that the moon, whereby (in the Apocalips) are ſignified all changeable things, is not trode under our feet as it ſhould be, <note place="margin">Revel. 12, 1, 2.</note> but is lifted above us, and doth eclipſe the light of Gods grace that it cannot ſhine upon us: mens unchaſte and unnatural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, their greedy and covetous aſpects, their cruelty and extortion, theſe are the planets whoſe conjunction and aſpects cauſe warres, plagues and famine; which I do not ſpeake as though the heavenly bodyes did not worke at all, I know and confeſſe they have their Phyſicall effects (though the diviſion of heavens into the houſes and parts, which the aſtrologians ſet downe, be moſt phantaſticall and blockiſh) but to teach us to caſt our eyes from the ſecond cauſes to the firſt, and that we would have our eyes fixed on our own ſins for which God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his chaſtiſement upon us, whereof the Jewes had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">Judg. 2 8. &amp;c.</note> who were then puniſhed by tyrants and oppreſſors when they fell from God and renounced his religion; which the Prophet ſheweth when he ſaith, that warre taught them that <note place="margin">Judg 3. 2.</note> which they could not before learne in peace. When <hi>Elies</hi> ſons through their wickedneſſe cauſed the ſervice of God to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, the Lord ſent warre amongſt them, and the Arke was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, &amp;c. when the Jewes would be by no meanes reclaimed, the Lord telleth them by the Prophet that he would do unto them as he had done unto <hi>Shilo</hi> for the wickedneſſe of his people, to <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 14.

               <p>But leaving them let us apply theſe things to our ſelves, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the exhortation which the Prophet uſeth to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords houſe, and you have heard the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their temple and our Church.

even as it did them to conſider our wayes for we are viſited with ſcarcity even as were they, but behold when as by reaſon hereof we ſhould be humbled under the mighty hand of God, to call our wayes to remembrance and to mend our naughty manners, we are wanton and give our ſelves to ſporting and paſtime, The which is by the ſound of the trumpet ſignified, not the ſound of atrumpet to proclaim a faſt, as the Lord commandeth by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: but to proclaime idle and ungodly playes, as though wee were reſolved to verefie that which the Prophet ſaith, <hi>I called</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>to weeping and mourning, and behold eating and drinking, &amp;c.</hi> which is alſo ſo much the worſe that theſe playes have been condemned by ſtatute of our univerſity, yea worſt of all for that at this time there is an order appointed by authority for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary prayers to be uſed, whereas we not onely take no ſuch order but rather the quite contrary by this diſorder, which is <note place="margin">Iſaih 22. 12, 13, 14.</note> ſuch that the cry thereof is carried from one ſide of the towne to the other, and though that cannot be ſaid of it as of the cry of them that ſate them downe to eate and drinke and roſe up to play. It is not the ſound of them that have the worſe, &amp;c. yet not farre unlike may it be ſaid. Jt is not the cry of warriours but of wantons. And here the Prophet ſetteth it downe that they ſowed much &amp;c. and layeth downe the cauſe for that the Lords houſe did lye waſte, let us alſo conſider, as the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, our own ways I will not diſcend to particular perſons, but let every man conſider it on his bed, whether there be not ſome who having many Eccleſiaſticall livings and much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in yearely into their hands thereby, yet may count it ſo as though it had been put into a bottomleſſe purſe: and whether many that live on pulſe be not in as good liking as they that feed on ſuch variety: I leave it to your owne conſideration.

Thirdly the reaſons for which he exhorteth them the reunto. For the firſt, it is the Lord, for though the exhortation be delivered by the voice and miniſtry of the Prophet, yet is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Lord that exhorteth them, even as it is added (ſaith the Lord) and this as the reſt of the Prophets are wont often to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that to raiſe up the hearts of the people to the dutifull conſideration of that which is uttered, for <hi>Haggai</hi> alſo mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſame both in the former words, and here againe, and likewiſe afterward, having thought it good to put them ſtill in remembrance hereof, thereby to move them to obey and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Commandment and promiſe delivered from the Lord, The which the very name of God which the Prophet uſeth, doth therefore recommend more effectually to them, becauſe it layeth before their eyes the Majeſty of him that ſpeaketh and the truth of the ſpeech.

               <p>Touching the former it may ſeeme ſtrange that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to take delight in the Temple, for if he taketh no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the ſtrength of a horſe neither delight in any mans leggs, how much leſſe likely is it that he ſhould take delight in an heape of ſtones and timber?

Now things contrary have contrary conſequences, as if he had thus ſaid in effect, as thoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements which heretofore you ſuffered came upon you becauſe you did not build the houſe of the Lord, ſo on the other ſide if you do build the ſame you ſhall be refreſhed by ſundry bleſſings: <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 14. 1 Tim. 4. 8</note> yet by the way when he ſaith, I will be glorified, he putteth them in minde what they ought to do, when they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe benefits, for ſo by the conſequent, he betokeneth the Antecedent, by the glorifying of him, the holy invocation of his name wherby he is glorified, and theſe be the reaſons whereby he ſtirreth up the Jewes to go up and bring timber and build the houſe. But doth the Prophet ſtirre up them only, and not us alſo?

And firſt let us conſider who they are that be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It is before ſaid, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> the Prince and the Prieſt as they whoſe helpe, and endeavour is moſt neceſſary to the building of the Church, becauſe they were as guides to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect others: yet as it is manifeſt in the 13 and 14 verſes, the Prophet was ſent to the remnant of the people, and the Promiſe as well made unto them, and their hearts likewiſe ſtirred up that they came and did the worke of the houſe of the Lord. They therefore who are to build by Gods Commandment are <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> with all the remnant of the people; principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Heb. c 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who are beſt able for ſpeciall graces, and gifts beſtowed on them, or becauſe of the miniſtery of the word, and authority committed unto them, but next all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple likewiſe, not the Prince and high Prieſt only: now for the Princes, how the Temple is to be built by them; I ſhewed you when I ſpake of the former verſe, at which time I ſhewed for the generall building that the foundation hereof is as the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes declareth the doctrine of the beginning of Chriſt taught and contained in the catachiſme, the building of the wall the laying of the roof is the perfection of doctrine and encreaſe of Godlines, till it be built in all reſpectts perfect, even ſuch aone pleaſeth God himſelfe to pourtray out in Scripture. Therefore touching the generall building, I then ſpake, which muſt be done by them that are in principall place the Queenes highneſſe and the ſtates in Parliament, and declared how it was to be done for the increaſe of true godlineſſe by preaching of whol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome doctrine and eſtabliſhing godly diſcipline through all Churches in the Realme according to the preſcription of the Lord revealed in his word: A thing though hardly hoped for in theſe dayes, in which ſo ſmall care is had in Univerſities to make ſufficient perſons to furniſh the miniſtery, and of Patrons abroad to call them that are ſufficient, finally ſo ſmall will in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſubmit themſelves to the yoake of Chriſt: yet it is to be prayed for of Gods people according to the example of <hi>Daniel</hi> who when the temple of God lay waſte more then ours, did
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117070:30"/>
make earneſt prayer to God to cauſe his face toſhine on his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary that did lye waſte, for the Lords ſake: but leaving this to them that have amongſt us the place of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and of whom we are to hope in due time they will have a care that the Church of God in all places be perfectly built up in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſpirit of <hi>Joſhua:</hi> let us remember the next branch, <note place="margin">Iude verſe 21, 22, 23.</note> namely that this commandment reacheth alſo to all the reſt of the people: for that this charge concerneth alſo all us likewiſe, Saint <hi>Jude</hi> the Apoſtle and brother of <hi>Iames</hi> expreſly teacheth, when he ſaith, <hi>but ye beloved edefie your ſelves in your moſt holy faith praying in the Holy Ghoſt and keeping your ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternall life and have compaſſion of ſome, in putting difference: and others ſave ſome with feare pulling them out of the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In which ſpeech there is an alluſion to the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein the clothes and garments that had touched any unclean things were likewiſe accounted uncleane, as if he would thereby teach them that they were to grow on continually from faith to faith in practiſe of Godlineſſe with ſuch a fervent zeale that they deteſt all contagion of ſin, and ſhew themſelves perfect (according as the weakenes of men will ſuffer) as their heavenly Father is perfect: but alas may I make this exhortation to all that are aſſembled in this place? I may make it to all, but would to God there were not in ſome even a want of the foundation. For what is the foundation? it is as <hi>Iude</hi> ſaith, <hi>a moſt holy faith.</hi> Now S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalontans</hi> writeth that all have not faith: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 2.</note> theſe words were true, not onely in his dayes but in ours, wherein, ſure, all men have not faith, and though all had faith, yet have they not this faith which <hi>Jude</hi> nameth a moſt holy faith; for many have faith which yet have not a moſt holy faith,

               <p>This houſe was to be but upon a mountaine, <hi>go up to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and our Saviour in the 5 of <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith of his Church that it is as a City ſet on a hill, wherefore if it were but only for this reaſon that the houſe we are to build ſtandeth on a hill and <note place="margin">Mat 5. 14.</note> therefore many eyes are caſt upon us, becauſe we may be ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off: as <hi>David</hi> prayed the Lord to guide him becauſe of them that eyed him, ſo we becauſe of the wicked and ungodly that looke upon us ought to be more carefull to looke unto it that we build carefully becauſe the houſe ſtandeth on a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, Let us theſefore remember that thoſe words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <note place="margin">Pſal. 5 8.</note> are ſpoken to all, <hi>a City ſet on a hill cannot be hid, neither do men light a candle and put it under a Buſhel but on a candle-ſtick: you are the ſalt of the earth, but if the ſalt have loſt its ſaltneſſe wherewith ſhall it be ſeaſoned?</hi> The Papiſts on this ſimilitude teach very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Church of God is viſible and ought to be ſo: as though we denyed it, but the groſſe errours which they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in urging this place are all of them plainely refuted by Saint <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 14. 15, 16,</note> 
                  <hi>Mathew</hi> in the very text. For firſt they imagine that if the Church be viſible it may be ſeen to every place, as though a City built on the Alpes becauſe it is a mountaine, muſt needs therefore be ſeene to <hi>Rome,</hi> or a City on the <hi>Pirenian</hi> mountaine of neceſſity
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:117070:33"/>
muſt be ſeene to <hi>Toledo.</hi> Nay to come neere to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing we have in hand, <hi>Bethania</hi> is but two miles from <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and yet they who have travelled in thoſe countreyes ſay that a man cannot ſee Jeruſalem from that place, albeit that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem were a City built upon a mountaine, yea upon many mountaines as the Prophet ſaith of it, her foundations are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the holy mountaines, but yet cannot men ſee it as I ſaid from <hi>Bethania</hi> by reaſon of Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> that lyeth betwixt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem and it: or that I may open it to you by a more familiar example, although a man ſhould go to Shotover, yet ſhould he not ſee Harrow on the hill, (the very name whereof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding declares that it ſtandeth on a hill) Nay it may be that all who have travelled from hence to London have not ſeen it. Perhaps they were blinde, perhaps they caſt not their eyes that way, perhaps though they did, yet were there ſuch miſts that by reaſon of them they could not ſee it, which indeed our Saviour, <note place="margin">Mat. 5 14, 15.</note> in the ſimilitude adjoyned, expreſly teacheth, you are ſaith hee the light of the world, neither do men light a candle and put it under a buſhell, but on a candleſticke, and it gives light unto all to all that are in the houſe: the candle gives light indeed, yet not to all, but to all in the houſe, but not to them that are without the houſe, the walls of the houſe keepe it from others, Againe they imagine that becauſe it is a City ſet on a hill, that therefore it muſt alwayes continue in the ſame caſe, and not ſometimes decay, and ſometimes have nothing remaining of it but only the foundation. Old <hi>Salisbury</hi> was a City built upon a hill howbeit now there is not much to be ſeen of it. <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe was built on ſeven hills, yet on the chiefeſt of them <hi>Aventinus, Collatinus, Capotolinus,</hi> on which it was firſt founded there is no building now to be found as they write that know it, unles it be three or four harlotrey houſes or happily ſome Monaſtery or a few gardens. A City therefore on a hill may ſometime be decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and this our Saviour ſignifieth in another ſimilitude, <hi>you are the ſalt of the earth, but if the ſalt have loſt his ſaltneſſe,</hi> Salt may loſe his ſaltneſſe then, and ſo a Church ſeated upon a hill may have that happen unto it, which is correſpondent to that in ſalt to loſe his ſavour. Finally they imagine that all houſes built upon a hill muſt be of one ſort, nor of one ſort onely, but of like condition and ſtate, whereas it may be that ſome are fallen ſome
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117070:34"/>
ſtanding, ſome hidden, ſome of divers kinds. And this our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our alſo putteth us in mind of: for did they to whom our Saviour ſpeaketh, make all one Church or City ſevered from the Jewes that were then of Jeruſalem? No; for the Papiſts ſay that after Chriſts aſcenſion, they firſt began to make a ſeverall Church from the Jewes; therefore then they ſhould have confidered that there were ſome of the Church who were members of it, diſagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them to whom Chriſt ſpake: as were in Jeruſalem they which frequented the publique and ordinary ſervice of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to the temple and heard the law, who yet in opinion and judgement diſſented from Chriſt and thoſe that beleived in him. Now in compariſon of that multitude, the diſciples of Chriſt were but few in that City: and even ſo in the midſt of Popery there have beene ſome Saints of God ſcattered among the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as were the Apoſtles among the unbeleeving Jewes in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem to whom this appertained; you are the light of the world: and were they hidden? No ſure, they were not hidden for the Papiſts found them out, and ſome of them alive paid for it whom they burned that their light might ſhine and be ſeene, and ſome they digged out of their graves when they had layen long dead, and that in them it was eaſily ſeen that they were as a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſet on a hill that could not be hidde; And ſo we may ſee it hath gone with the Saints of God even here in England ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was firſt planted in it, and with the Church which at one time hath been in better caſe then at another, even as it happeneth to Cities amongſt us which are not at all times ſo well built &amp; maintained, and Churches alſo who at all times are not ſo well repaired, but to returne to our purpoſe ſeeing wee are built on a mountaine and therefore are ſure to have ſo many eyes looking upon us, let us be more wary to looke to our ſelves, and ſeeing wee are to live in the midſt of a froward and crooked generation let us have care to ſhine forth like lights in the world as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle exhorteth the Philippians, and hold out the light as thoſe <note place="margin">phil 2. 3.</note> that were perſecuted in the time of the <hi>Arrians</hi> who yet were light and ſalt who were to give light to them in the houſe and ſeaſon them that received their words.</p>

Now to us for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and tooles are indeed our lawes and ſtatutes whereby our worke is to be framed and directed. When the children of the Prophets came to <hi>Elizeus</hi> and craved leave of him that, becauſe the place where they dwelt was too little for them, they might go to <hi>Jordan,</hi> that every one might take thence a beame and make them more roome, and he granting them leave, and going himſelfe with them: as they were about their worke a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Indeed they be in the Proctors booke but there they be as if they were fallen into the water. The Children of the Prophets have complained unto <hi>Elizeus</hi> alas Maſter they were but borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and great need have they to know them, for that they are bound in conſcience by oath to keep them. To which purpoſe ſome have taken paines to reſtore them; notwithſtanding it hath yet pleaſed God to move them that ſhould ſee it accompliſhed, howbeit we may hope to ſee it when it ſhall pleaſe God to place in that room a man that hath <hi>Elizeus</hi> ſpirit: ſure, there is great uſe of them for the cutting and framing of the Caedars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to build, eſpecially if thoſe which be knowne already were kept, which <hi>I</hi> muſt needs alſo adde, becauſe that of thoſe which are knowne many have their edges rebated by diſpenſations. A lamentable thing that we keepe yet ſo much that which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ſinke of Rome, which I ſpeake not as though our diſpenſations were ſo deteſtable as his who taketh upon him to diſpenſe againſt the commandment of the Apoſtle however it pleaſe him, to diſtinguiſh of the precepts of the Apoſtle which he commandeth not God; but in a place and matter where lawes and orders are taken to the contrary, it is no way tollerable. <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the Princes of the Phyloſophers have affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that it is moſt pernicious in a common-wealth to breake the lawes which are once appointed, which we learne even out of them, if we reade them to make our profit of them, and not only to talke of them: which neither yet do <hi>I</hi> ſpeake as though I would have nothing diſpenſable, but that when it is ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that there ſhall not in ſuch caſes be any diſpenſations abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, yet that we ſhould continually come againſt this decree. For what can be more abſurd than that men of judgement and diſcretion ſhould make no more account to breake Gods lawes than children would do to break ſticks; but if ſtatutes were only broken by diſpenſations the matter were more tollerable, for then ſhould we alſo have our parts in it, but ſtatutes have been broken without diſpenſations, wherof the experience is freſh in your memory, the laſt week as you know, or if you know it not, I tell what I meane, even the playes kept againſt the expreſſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, by the tollerance and connivance of the Magiſtrate, the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute hath been broken.</p>

ſword to the mortifying and ſlaying of the old man.</p>
               <p>A great helpe hereunto might have beene the example if it had continued of many, who heretofore out of other places, and laſtly out of this have broken the bread of life amongſt us. But what ſhall I complain of the maſſe of freewill-offerings, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe that were neceſſarily appointed, either the morning or the evening offerings are oftentimes wanting, ſo that often that which ſhould be offered in the Evening, is offered in the Morning, is offered in the morning, as at this preſent. Howbeit, that the free-will offrings ſo long continued ſhould be intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the next year after God had delivered us from the Spaniard, I cannot but lament, when ſuch offrings ſhould rather be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the glory of God, and teſtimony of our thankefulneſſe for ſo wonderfull a deliverance.</p>
               <p>The fault hereof I cannot lay on them that before took pains herein, or on the cheife Magiſtrate, for that of them many are otherwiſe imployed. And the Mageſtrate I thinke was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that it hath been the uſe for them in that place to ſolicite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for this thing was at the beginning of the entrance into his office. But I beſeech you that are the Lords remembrancers, that you would uſe all meanes to procure that theſe free-will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings may be continued again. When there had been long want of raine in Iſrael, <hi>Elias</hi> promiſed <hi>Ahab,</hi> at length, that there ſhould be raine, and going to the top of a mountaine ſent his ſervant to looke, who at the firſt ſaw nothing, and he ſtill ſent him down till at the 7 time, when at length he ſaw a little cloud ariſing like a hand at the firſt, whereof afterwards enſued great raine: It may be you ſhall not have your deſire at the firſt, nor at the ſecond time, yet I beſeech you not to omit this thing for at length, doubt not after ſeven times you ſhall ſee, though it be not a cloud, whereof may enſue great ſtore of raine. A cauſe of the intermitting hereof may be the diſlike which by ſome diviſion amongſt us by preaching might be bred, becauſe that all of us are not of one minde. For though all agree that the foundations and walls of the building of the Lords Temple be laid, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt us, yeſome thinke the covering of the ſame is not ſo good as it ought to be: others are of opinion that it is good and ſufficient, ſome thinke that there wanteth a fence about it for the keeping out of beaſts, as we reade <hi>Nehemiah</hi> required him
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:117070:46"/>
timber of King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> for building of the gates of incloſure that appertained to the houſe of the Lord, though weknow that in the dayes of <hi>Darius</hi> the temple was perfected, howbeit what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever diſſention there be among us about circumſtances, yet we are brethren, and God forbid we ſhould come any more to ſuch diſtempered ſpeeches, as ſome one both ſides have done: if they had had to have dealt with the Samaritan, that had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yea happily to much, ſome of it, ſeeing it falleth within that which the Apoſtle hath forbidden, as not fit to be amongſt Saints.</p>
               <p>Let us remember that which the Apoſtle writeth to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians, <hi>in that whereunto we are come, let us proceed by one rule, that we may minde one thing,</hi> now unto this we are all come, that we acknowledge that there is neceſſary in the Church an able and ſufficient miniſtery, and that in this Seminary ſuch might be trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up in learning and godlineſſe here amongſt us, that being thorowly ſeaſoned therewithall, they may be made fit to build up the Church of God, not as deceitfull workemen, but as wiſe and faithfull builders. One of the wiſeſt amongſt the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers giving precepts for the good government of a common-wealth, ſhewing of what ſort governours, aſſiſtants and others ſhould be, ſaith, that God in framing men for government, in thoſe which are to be chiefe hath mixed Gold, in thoſe which are fit to aſſiſt Silver, in husbandmen and ſuch as are to obey, braſſe and iron; now theſe are of one kindred that beget their like; yet ſometimes it falleth out that a golden father begetteth a brazen childe, and a brazen father begetteth a golden childe, that the ſonne ſhall not be permitted to take the office of his father, but that he ſhould be ſet among the husbandmen: and if a braſen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould have a golden ſonne, that the governours ſhould take him from amongſt the braſſe and iron, and place him amongſt the golden children, receiving this as an Oracle that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth muſt then go to wrack, when they ſhall be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to preferr braſſe and iron to the place appointed for gold and ſilver. This is but a fable I know, and like to that of Jothans, but the morall of it is agreable to our purpoſe, there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us certaine diſpoſitions as it were of gold and ſilver, fit to be placed among Eccleſiaſticall and civill charges of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome of another temper, not fit for government, great
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117070:47"/>
care is to be had by thoſe that are in place of government, that braſſe ſonnes are not preferred to places appointed for golden children, that if they be not furniſhed for ſuch places, they may be applied for that to which they are fit. Therefore you that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern conſidering according to the rule of the holy ſcripturs, that all muſt go to wracke when braſſe and iron are placed in charge, are to be requeſted to have care, that when you are to make choiſe of ſuch as are to be in place of government, that you make choiſe of ſuch as are of gold; at leaſt of ſilver diſpoſitions, but if you meet with ſuch as are of braſſe and iron, then play the part of Apollonians, and ſignifie to their freinds that they are not fit for ſuch places, but that they may be ſet to that wherewith they may do moſt good. Eſpecially care would be had of ſtatutes which godly founders have provided for maintenance, of ſuch as being fit for ſuch places, their parents being not able to traine them up: a lamentable caſe that golden purſes ſhould be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before golden witts. It is pittiſull though we ought alſo to be thankefull for it, that the Parliament hath taken ſuch order therein, which we our ſelves would not, yet pittifull it is that a law ſhould be made for the reſtraint of corruption in thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, howbeit, if this law do not reſtraine them that buy and ſell for gold, let them moreover take heed leſt favour ſometime compaſſe that corruption which mony did before: nay if your owne children and freinds be braſſe beware you preferre them not, when gold ſhould be preferred, prefer your own you may, but then when they be fitt. <hi>Moſes</hi> made not any of his children rulers after him, but <hi>Joſhua,</hi> yet made he his brethren Prieſts and his children, becauſe they were fit for thoſe places; his owne they were not, we have laws to ſhew whom they be that be ſo qualified that they may be choſen, our founders had ſuch care therein, that they would not ſo much as have their owne kinſmen preferred unles they be ſo qualified. The candleſticks of the ſanctuary were of gold, which were to hold out the lights, ſome parts of the ſanctuary were covered with ſilver, there was alſo about the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary uſe for braſſe, but for government they onely are to be choſen whom God in their creating hath intermingled gold with their mettall, and as they ſhould have ſpecall care hereof in Election ſa afterwards they are made fit, leſt that which is dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate end become copper, for many things ſhew to be gold
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:117070:47"/>
which afterwards prove otherwiſe, ſo are they not to be taken for gold untill that by conſtancy in going forward they make perfection of the ſame, they are by their towardneſſe before to be eſteemed but their tryall comes after. This might be performed if orders already provided heretofore were performed, and where they want they were ſupplied, that ſuch exerciſes were maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all Colledges and Halls, to make theſe inſtruments indeed of gold fit for theſe purpoſes: I am loth to enter into diſcourſe of our particular fault herein, of the negligence and ſome what more then negligence of many neither of the faction maintained in ſundry places, by ſuch as love to fiſh in troubled waters, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in generall.</p>
               <p>I would have ſuch to remember as are to be made ſtones of this ſpirituall building, cheife ſtones and corner ſtones, to be trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up to ſerve either in Church or common-wealth, that they ought willingly to ſubmit themſelves to good orders, whereby they may be fit for the building. The ſtones muſt be ſquared, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, poliſhed and graven, which had they reaſon and ſenſe, they would not have neglected, how much more willing ſhould you be to ſubmit your ſelves hereunto, eſpecially for that ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull-uſe. The Philoſophers ſaid that the ſtones appointed for altars were happy inſtruction, reproof, correction, may ſeem unpleaſant, but if you have that care which living ſtones ſhould have, that religious feeling which you ought, you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſubmit your ſelves to ſuch things, without which you cannot be made fit, and be content though you be reſtrained of ſuch things as elſe where happily be hold tolerable, and may not be permitted, as your Chriſtmas Lords, an uſe taken from the heathen, as Polidorus Virgill ſheweth, which in no place are tollerable: but among the Prophets and their children ſuch diſcords are moſt of all to be condemned, the very name thereof ſheweth the inconvenience of the thing, as alſo the reſt unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and unfruitfull delights, as playes to ſay no more of them. It is obſerved that corruption entered firſt amongſt the Jewes by thoſe meanes whereby through the policy of Antiochus and the enemies, their minds were ſo much effeminated. In this alſo we all agree, that as there ought alſo to be godly and learned mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſo there ſhould be a ſufficient maintenance for them: which in ſome places being ſufficient, they only are to be requeſted who
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:117070:48"/>
are in authority to diſpoſe of ſuch livings as Patrons: that they have a care that the candleſticks which are to hold out the light may be of gold, but ſuch are a great deale worſe, which take gold to preferre brazen-noſe men, but let them take heed leſt they fall into that miſchiefe, which the example of Ananias and Saphira, teacheth againſt them that go about to intervert any part of thoſe livings which either themſelves on their predeceſſors have applyed to the maintenance of the houſe of God.</p>
               <p>It may be there are not many in this place that have to deal in this matter, but ſome there are that hereafter may, to whom this latter exhortation may appertain, namly that where there is not a ſufficient maintenance appointed for the miniſter, there themſelvs would be carefull to increaſe it; following the example of the princes of <hi>Judah,</hi> who with willing harts (as <hi>Moſes</hi> noteth) off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

vaniſh from his mind and heart, that he never after came amongſt them any more. Now let us well conſider my brethren, that if <hi>Alippins</hi> profited ſo well in hearing a rhethorick lecture, both for the informing of his judgement, and reformation of his life, and all by the bleſſing of God, as <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelfe doth acknowledge in that place, why may not, why ought not we to looke for the like good fruit and effect of our deſires, and labours in hearing of divine lectures, and godly ſermons, ſuch as may be more able having a better promiſe, to convince the judgement, convert a ſinner, ſave a ſoule and cover a multitude of finnes. And this we ſhall yet the more effectually finde and feele, if we reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and obediently (as it now followeth in this ſcripture) hearken to the meſſenger of the Lord in the Lords meſſage: <hi>Then ſpake</hi> Haggai <hi>the Lords meſſenger in the Lords meſſage unto the people, ſaying I am with you ſaith the Lord.</hi> Theſe words comprehend another ſermon of the Prophet Haggai, and do ſignify thus much in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unto us, that after the people were moved a little, at the firſt ſermon to reverence and obey the word of the Lord ſent unto them: yet notwitſtanding they ſtayed a little, and then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet came againe unto them, both to take ſome feare out of their hearts, which was upon them, and alſo to make them a promiſe of Gods gratious preſence, and aſſiſtance in this great buſineſſe, <hi>feare not I am with you ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the words of the Prophet it doth evidently appeare that in this worke of the building of the Temple, they much feared the Perſian King, leſt he ſhould moleſt or hinder them in the ſame, therfore the Lord ſendeth them this word that they ſhould not feare, for he would be with them to incourage and ſtrenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them, and cauſe the worke to proſper in their hands: and leaſt they ſhould think he ſpake this of himſelf and not from the Lord, the Prophet addeth thus. <hi>Then ſpake Haggai the Lords meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, in the Lords meſſage unto the people, ſaying, I am with you ſaith the Lord,</hi> ſhewing therby that he came unto them, not only as the meſſenger of the Lord, but that the thing which he brought was the Lords meſſage alſo. When <hi>David</hi> being troubled in his minde that he ſhould dwel in a houſe of <hi>Caedar</hi> trees, &amp; the Ark of God, remain under curtaines, he purpoſed in his thoughts to build a houſe unto the Lord, Nathan the Prophet ſpake unto him ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Go, do all that is in thy heart, for the Lord is with thee.</hi> Nathan

that ſpake this was the meſſenger of the Lord, becauſe he was a holy Prophet of the Lord, but that which he ſpake was his own and not any meſſage from the Lord; for the fame night the word of the Lord came unto Nathan, to let <hi>David</hi> underſtand that not he, but his ſon that ſhould proceed out of his loynes, ſhould build a houſe unto the Lord. A good leſſon for ſuch as preach, or prophecy unto Gods people, to hold nothing backe from them, which the Lord by them hath ſent unto them, but to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto them the whole councell of God, as Saint Paul did, that they may ſay with more comfort, even as he ſayed, <hi>that which we have received deliver we unto you as the Meſſage of the Lord,</hi> and the Lords meſſenger. Which alſo juſtly condemneth ſuch of our Prophets and Preachers, as refuſing to ſtand in the councell of the Lord, and to deliver his word unto his people, do utter the dreames and deceipt of their owne hearts, and put upon them the fancies and viſions of their owne heads, of whom the Lord may juſtly ſay now as he ſaid of ſome ſuch Prophets in Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs time. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets yet they ran, I have not ſpoken unto them, yet they propheſied:</hi> and this may well ſerve alſo for a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian admonition unto all ſuch as are hearers of the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to looke as carefully to the Meſſage as to the meſſenger, to the matter as to the man, and to try the ſpirits, and proving all things take hold of that which is good, like the men of <hi>Berea</hi> who are ſaid to be more <hi>noble than they of</hi> Theſſalonica <hi>in that they received the word with all readineſſe of minde, and ſearched the ſcriptures dayly whether, thoſe things which Paul had taught them were ſo.</hi>

               <p>We may heare alſo well and worthily obſerve how neceſſary often preaching is to Gods people, if ever we will draw them to walke in his feare, <hi>the ſpirit may be willing but the fleſh is weake</hi> as our Saviour ſaith, and when we are at the beſt, our beſt dutyes are full of many wants, and mingled with much imperfection, inſomuch that we have need continually to be ſtirred up quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſtrengthened unto every good worke by the preaching of the word. It is not enough for Paul to plant unleſſe Apollos doth water alſo, there muſt be precept upon precept, line upon <note place="margin">Lſai 28.</note> line, here a little and there a little, neither muſt the Philippians be weary of hearing the ſame things often, ſeing it is not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous unto Paul to write them, and for them it is a ſafe thing:

So cleare and undoubted it is that the circumſtance of time and the courſe of the ſcripture, doth ſhew that as ſoone as the ſpirit of the Lord did ſtirre them up, they made no delay, but went and built the houſe of the Lord, ſo that they did not then deferre, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes as before they had done yeares, but went and did worke in the Lords houſe: we may alſo further here obſerve that this houſe is called <hi>The Houſe of the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> To ſhew <note place="margin">Ezdras 1. 2 Ezra 4. 17. 23.</note> his power over all creatures, a thing which might ſtand much for their incouragement: for whenas they had began to build the houſe of the Lord. <hi>Ezdras</hi> 1, 2. by the permiſſion of Cyras: then their adverſaries procured a commiſſion from Artaxerxes to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and moleſt them in the building of the roofe, and afterwards they obtained liberty to reedifie the ſame, in the dayes of Darius as appeareth, <hi>Ezdras</hi> 4. 24, ſo that they might have beene diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, <note place="margin">Ez. 4. 24.

The conſideration whereof muſt needs <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 2. 3. &amp; 15. 1. 5. and Gen. 17. 7, Rom. 15, 4</note> breed a child-like affection in them to obey ſo good a Father, for when he might have juſtly puniſhed them for their daily ſinnes, yet as a loving father, he raiſed them out of the ſame, which muſt needs incourage them and make them thankefull for it <hi>(and the Lord ſtirred up the ſpirit of Zerubbabel.)</hi> The ſpirit of God teaceth us that what ſoever is written a fore time is written for our inſtruction, ſo that in this place we may learne divers leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for our learning.

And therefore the Lord here by his Prophet with this thought laid before them encourageth them to goe forward in the building of the temple, adding to ſtirre them up hereunto three moſt gracious promiſes, firſt of his aſſiſtance with his word and <note place="margin">Three promiſes to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Iewes to reedefie the temple 1 2 3</note> ſpirt in the building of the temple, ver. 4, 5. <hi>Be ſtrong and worke and I am with you:</hi> ſecondly of honouring it with Chriſts preſence in it, verſe 6, 7.

               <p>Concerning the charge given to the Prophet, we muſt call to minde that in the firſt day of the ſixth moneth he was ſent unto them from the Lord to exhort them to build, and after in the foure and twentieth day of the ſame moneth, he was ſent with a new meſſage to cauſe them to goe forward in building, with one of theſe promiſes concerning the Lords aſſiſtance, when they ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up with things being conſidered and compared with that which followeth, that notwithſtanding both the former ſermons of the Prophet and the working grace of the Spirit, to meet

of the Apoſtles his glory was ſpread farre and neere, and ſo he became glorious who in his paſſion had bin infamous, and therefore the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. often repeates that the miniſtery of the goſpell was glorious, becauſe it did publiſh the glory of him, now this being done, firſt at Jeruſalem, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. and the Apoſtles abiding in the Temple, <hi>Acts.</hi> the 1. and when they weare arreſted, <hi>Act.</hi> 45.

And yet the prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> 61. 2. ſheweth plainely, that that was a type, the ſubſtance whereof <note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 2.</note> was eſtabliſhed by Chriſt, who was anointed (as he ſaith) to preach deliverance to the captives, and the acceptable yeare of the Lord, as he expounds it of himſelfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yeare of Gods favour, wherein as at the Jubilee, all were ſet at liberty, and reſtored to their former eſtate; So when Chriſt came, they ſhould bee delivered from bondage, and reſtored to the liberty of the ſonnes of God, which to bee done by Chriſt to continue, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, <hi>Corin.</hi> where hee ſaith, <hi>Now is that acceptable time, now is that day of ſalvation:</hi> Which to reſtraine to one yeare in 50. if I ſhould compare them to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly rudiments, I ſhould too much honour them, being rather a profane error, which I need not further to make infamous then by opening their covetouſneſſe ſhewed therein, which <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Virg.</hi> our owne Hiſtioriographer, Chapter 26. ſets downe, writing that the laſt great Jubilee before, this in the yeare 1500.

how farre ſhort it would come of the former, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, therefore this is added, that the glory of this latter houſe ſhould be greater then the glory of the former, and that not only in reſpect of the ſpirituall glory mentioned in the former verſe, <hi>And I will fill this houſe with glory;</hi> but even with temporall and eternall glory alſo, wherewith becauſe the other was ſo beautified, they were caſt downe and diſcouraged, as if the latter would be nothing in reſpect of the former; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord here doth not only promiſe to fill it with glory, but alſo that the glory thereof ſhall be greater then the glory of the former; which for that (in reſpect of that glory which they meant, it might ſeeme a thing unpoſſible, ſince they had not the riches of <hi>Solomon</hi> which built the former.) Therefore firſt the Lord mentions that the ſilver is his, and the gold is his, &amp;c. The ſilver is mine, and the gold is mine, as if hee had ſaid, notwithſtanding yee are now poore, and ſee no meanes how to effect this, yet it is in my power to inrich you, <hi>The earth is the Lords, and all that therein is,</hi> which he ſhewed when hee fulfilled <note place="margin">Pſal. 24.</note> his promiſe by raiſing up <hi>Herod,</hi> and inriching him to build up this Houſe in glory, as an eye witneſſe, <hi>Joſephus</hi> by name <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitat. l.</hi> 15. <hi>e. ult.</hi> and <hi>de bello Judaico, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5, as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in the Greeke, doth teſtifie; the diſciples deſire our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to behold the goodly buildings of the Temple.

Further he affirmeth, that nine of the doores were covered with gold, the upper gate with Corinthian braſſe, the inward with gold: the poſts were covered with gold, the forefronts with plates of gold, the roofe ſet with round ſpires and boules of gold, ſo that all was either gliſtering white, or ſhining with gold. And ſo alſo within, the veſſels were many of gold, ſome

               <p>And this you ſee, that the Lord of Hoſtes, the Almighty God, ſignifying unto theſe people, that gold and ſiluer is his, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he can performe what they cannot, doth promiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he will make the glory of this latter houſe greater then the former, and therewithall will bleſſe it with peace and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall proſperitie.</p>

take away diſtruſtfulneſſe from them, the ſilver is mine, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in this ground of common faith, that the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the right of creation, doth injoy and poſſeſſe all earthly bleſſings, and can as he pleaſe diſpoſe them. This <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did not ſo well remember, when <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſpeake to the Rocke, and promiſed that the water ſhould flow out, they by deſtruſting Gods power, did not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Lord in their hearts, nor ſo before the people by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his promiſe as they ſhould have done, that therefore he would not let them bring the people into <hi>Canaan,</hi> God then ſanctified by beleeving, this which here is ſaid that the ſilver is his, under which are comprehended all other creatures and temporall bleſſings as his owne and at his diſpoſing, ſerving for the performance of his will, the benefit of his ſervants. When <hi>Samaria</hi> was beſieged and the famine ſo ſore that the Mothr was to boyle her ſonne, and to refreſh her ſelfe with her owne childe as we reade, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. and the Prophet coming to the King told him from the Lord, that by to morrow this time there ſhould be plenty in the gate of <hi>Samaria:</hi> A Prince on whom the King leaned, thinking it a thing impoſſible, anſwered the man of God and ſaid, behold, If God ſhould make windows in the heaven, could this come to paſſe? The Prophet replyed that he was ſent from God and confirming that which he ſaid, threatned him puniſhment for his incredulity, that he ſhould ſee it with his eyes, but that he ſhould not taſte thereof, as alſo it came to paſſe when the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſent from God promiſed <hi>Zachary</hi> a ſonne, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>How can this be,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſince I am old and my wife barren?</hi> well ſaith the Angel, I am ſent from God and it ſhall be, but becauſe thou haſt not beleeved thou ſhalt be dumbe untill this thing be done, which example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Aaron,</hi> of the Prince and of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> doth teach us to beleeve, that what the Lord doth promiſe in his word it ſhal undoubtedly be made good by his worke in due ſeaſon, ſilver is his, and gold is his, for ſo ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes, <hi>The ſilver is mine, and the gold is mine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A point that may further teach us to remember that ſeeing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo theſe earthly bleſſings are the Lords, therefore in getting, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, looſing or wanting them, we ſhould have care ſo to behave our ſelves as thoſe that know they are not ours, but the Lords,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:117070:76"/>
In getting he giveth it them to whom it pleaſeth him, and it is not (as many fooliſhly imagine) committed to the Prince of the world, to be diſpoſed by him at his pleaſure: It's true indeed, that Sathan ſaid ſo, that all the Kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them are delivered unto him, and to whom hee would, he gave them, but he ſaid it falſly, and for the moſt part as falſe as this wee ſee here worldly men, as if ſilver and gold and theſe worldly things were not the bleſſings which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes, ſeeke them by unjuſt and unlawfull meanes, belike think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are none of Gods at all, otherwiſe as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid hee would ſerve <hi>Laban</hi> ſeven yeares for his daughter <hi>Rachel;</hi> ſo they would alſo ſerve God for his bleſſings. But with many (as the wiſe man ſaith) ſtolne waters are ſweet, and his bread is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. The ſonnes of <hi>Eli</hi> robbed the people that came to ſacrifice, and tooke by force that which was not theirs: And I would to God that not only the ſons of <hi>Eli,</hi> but that alſo our <hi>Elies</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for I would be loath to judge any, did they not, I will not ſay rob, but did they take more then their owne from the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords Sacrifices, &amp;c. Sure if any ſo doe, they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not with <hi>David, Pſalme</hi> 15. that preferment comes not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, but that it is the Lord that doth give it, elſe they would be of <hi>Davids</hi> mind I hope, who <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 11.</note> would not doe any thing that hee ſhould not againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> a wicked-King, no not for a Kingdome; <hi>God forbid that I ſhould doe this, and ſinne egainſt God, &amp;c.</hi> They that pray to God as their heavenly Father, <hi>Give as this day our daily bread,</hi> and yet delight in ſtolne waters, ſhew that they doe the luſts of another Father; <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> God forbid that I ſhould ſay they are of another Father, but ſure herein they ſerve him, by ſerving another then the Lord in good duties, they ſhould get that they deſire by good meanes; For ſilver is mine, and gold is mine, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in uſing we are but Stewards to the Lord, in uſing and diſpoſing thoſe bleſſings which wee enjoy, and therefore muſt remember, that wee muſt give an account thereof unto the Lord. <hi>Nabal,</hi> when <hi>Davids</hi> meſſengers came to him for ſome proviſion to refreſh himſelfe and his followers, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. <hi>Shall I take my bread, and my wine, and my fleſh, &amp;c. And give it to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?</hi> All was mine, and mine, and mine with him, he did not conſider, that he had received them from God, to be at his will
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:117070:77"/>
diſpoſed, not all for himſelfe, but ſome for others alſo. It is ſaid <hi>Proverbs</hi> 3. <hi>Withold not the goods from the owner thereof; neither ſay to thy neighbour, goe, and come againe too morrow, &amp;c.</hi> The owners are called, them that has need of any good we have, and we are but as ſtewards to diſpoſe it to them, according to that rule in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, He that ſoweth bountifully, ſhall alſo reape bountifully, for the Lord loves a cheerefull giver,</hi> and he gives <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 6.</note> twice, that gives quickly.</p>
               <p>The Iſraelites in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> had forgotten that it was the Lord <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 9.</note> that gave them ſilver and gold, flax and oyle, which they gave to <hi>Baal,</hi> and therefore hee threatens to take it away; So, if wee beſtow thoſe bleſſings that he gives us, amiſſe, let us know, that he yet retaines an intereſt in them to take away. What if his ſilver and his gold bee beſtowed upon Papiſts Images, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp;c. what if men make their bellies their Gods, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. and ſerve them with their riches like <hi>Polixhemus</hi> in <hi>Euripides,</hi> who ſaid he never ſacrificed to any God but to his belly, and he thought that wiſe men would thinke that it's a mans God to eate and drinke; yet for all this, the right of theſe bleſſings thus abuſed by wicked men, belongs unto God, and hee will at his pleaſure both take them away from them, and call them to an account for the abuſe of them. Alas, if it were not ſo with us alſo, we ſhould be more ready to come to theſe aſſemblies, when as we are ſo ready to fill our owne bellies, but let us know, that we have now but the diſpoſing of theſe things, and the Lord will require an account of us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what if we looſe them, yet let us comfort our ſelves <note place="margin">3 <hi>In loſing.</hi>
                  </note> with <hi>Job,</hi> remembring, that the Lord gives, and the Lord takes away, and therefore bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if we want them, yet remember they are the Lords, <note place="margin">4 <hi>In want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Pſal. 73. Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to come from this point, <note place="margin">Acts 17.</note>

which is ſet downe to ſtrengthen their faith in the power of God to the promiſe it ſelfe, of greater glory, <hi>The glory of this houſe ſhall be greater then the former,</hi> which miniſters greater comfort to the Church, as comprehended with <hi>Judah</hi> in this promiſe under the name of <hi>Iſrael, Zach.</hi> 8. 13. whereby <hi>Iſrael</hi> is meant the ſame as in that ſpeech, <hi>Gallat.</hi> 6. <hi>As many as walke according to this rule, peace ſhall be upon them, and upon the Iſraels of God, &amp;c.</hi> Iſrael not according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit.

And <hi>verſe</hi> 9. he ſaith, that <hi>the Iſles ſhall come, and the ſhips of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh, &amp;c.</hi> Even <hi>they that grow by merchandiſe unto greater wealth,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23. ſpeaks of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> that came with their ſilver and their gold <note place="margin">Iſa. 23. 18.</note> unto the Lord, to beautifie therewith his ſpirituall Temple, the Church.</p>
               <p>This is that then which here is promiſed, that God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the merchandiſe of his Church thoſe things that may be ſufficient, as for food and raiment; for ſo the Apoſtle interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the promiſe, limits it 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>When we have food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let us therewith bee content.</hi> Howbeit to this is added a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory due in this life, (that prerogative to bee called the <note place="margin">John 2. 12 2 Cor. 4.</note> ſonnes of God) and fellow heires with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> the 8.

But whereas hereupon they would inferre, that they cannot erre in doing it, ſo making that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe what they ſhould doe, not onely a precept what they ought to doe, that very place in <hi>Malach.</hi> 2 <hi>Chap. verſe</hi> 8. ſheweth the contrary, where it is added by way of reproofe; <hi>But yee are gone out of the way, yee have cauſed many to fall by the Law.</hi> So that it is manifeſt by the whole drift of that place, that the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, for hee is the meſſenger of the Lord of Hoaſts, and therefore they that doe not ſo, deſerve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,

Therefore <hi>I have made you contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</hi> But after this interpretation of the Jeſuite, every man in his calling almoſt as well as the Prieſts, may claime a prerogative of not learning in the performance of this duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. of the Magiſtrate it is ſaid, that hee is for the praiſe of them that doe well. What therefore ſhall wee ſay; <hi>Nero</hi> being a Magiſtrate, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> failed therein, or that all they that did well received a promiſe of <hi>Nero?</hi> Againe, the wife is ſaid to be made a helpe unto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, what? may we thinke that every wife is ſo, or that <hi>Jobs</hi> wife was ſo, and did performe this duty to her husband?

O wicked ſervant; Theſe places ſhew indeede that the Magiſtrates ſhould be for the praiſe of them that doe well, that the wife ſhould be a helpe to her husband, that the child ſhould be obedient to his father, but not all of theſe are ſo alwayes: And ſo the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, as in the future tenſe this word is often uſed, or imply a duty as even <hi>(Ribera)</hi> a papeſt confeſſeth that even <hi>Bellar:</hi> from his owne men might have learned not to have abuſed his Reader, and for the thing itſelf, although the prieſts here twice anſwer well, yet other examples ſhew how fowly they erred often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as to note but 2. for all in <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.

               <p>This point therfore we are not to learn by the Prophet in this place, but rather becauſe they are falſe teachers which come in ſheeps cloathings, therefore it behooveth us to be carefull that we be not ledd by falſe guides, for ſuch as you have heard, may be

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:117070:84"/>
and ſo is this whole nation before me,</hi> &amp;c. the force of the illation or argument, why the Jewes were not ſanctified by their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, but count their ſacrifices defiled by their diſobedience, doth conſiſt in the myſteries repreſented by thoſe ceremonies. For Firſt <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our Saviour was ſignified by the ſinne-offering whoſe fleſh was moſt holy, here called holy fleſh, the touching of which here ſignifies the ſpirituall touching of Chriſt by faith, as the woman <hi>Luke</hi> 8. is by our Saviour ſaid only to have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, when as others did more then ſo; wherefore, ſince they that truly doe beleeve in God, do love him and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and the Jewes did not build the Temple as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, it followeth that although the Jewes did touch that which in ſome ſort might be ſaid to touch Chriſt, viz. the ſacrifices and ſhaddowes of the law, wherein he was covered as in the skirt of a garment, yet they did not touch Chriſt himſelfe by a lively faith working by love, therefore they were not by theſe ſacrifices ſanctified and made Holy; nay contrarily all their ſacrifices were by them defiled and made uncleane, ſince the touching of a dead body did ſignifie the committing of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſobedience, which was deadly: and whatſoever ſuch a perſon did touch did ſignify whatſoever he did, which thereby he defiled, ſo that the Jewes being themſelves defiled by their diſobedience in not building of the Temple defiled all their works; even their very offerings, ſeemed they never ſo holy before men, yet before God they were but polluted and defiled. Now to paſſe by the ground of this reproofe, the teſtimony, namely of the Prieſts out of the law, of which before ver. 12. and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to other notes of inſtruction, 1 from the two ſimilitudes in generall from the ptne of their meaning applyed we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the ſacrifices and ceremonies of the old law were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God, not to ſignify only thoſe things, which the, words barely did import unto the Jewes, but other myſter ies alſo for the comfort of the godly unto the end of the world: this the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. ſheweth us, that theſe were but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes 1 as it were the juſt draughts of the lineaments, as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">His name was <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
