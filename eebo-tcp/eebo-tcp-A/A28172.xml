            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This beloved Apostle who leaned upon Christs bosome, and was likely to learn the very secrets of the art of fishing souls, you see how he goeth about the business; he useth an holy art in this Preface; being about to give a re-capitulation of the whole Gospel, and to make a short summary of the Doctrine of it, for the more effectual establishment, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of souls already converted, and for the more powerful pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>swasion of others to imbrace it; he useth all the skill that can be in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to dispose mens hearts to receive it; like a wise Orator, he labours to make them <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, dociles, &amp; benevolos:</hi> to stir up their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to conciliat their affection, and so to make them docile, and easily teachable: He stirrs up attention, when he shews that he is not to speak about trifling light matters, or low things, or things that do not concern them; but concerning the greatest, most concerning, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

of life,</hi> in which all their life was wrapt up: which though it was ancient in it self, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it was a new thing to the world, and so for all respects deserved to be taken serious notice of. Then he conciliats their benevolence and good-will, by shewing his own good affection towards them, and his great design in it, that it was only for their good and salvation, that he had nothing else before him, but to have them partakers with himself, in that same hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse: he had sound a jewel, and he hides it not, but proclaims it, that all men may have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with him, and that is, with <hi>God,</hi> and that cannot but bring in full joy to the heart. Now a soul being made thus attentive, and willing to hear, it is the best disposition, that makes them most capable of being taught. If those two stayes were come over; the careless regard that is in mens hearts towards the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and the suspicious thoughts and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against the Ambassadours of it, then what would hinder to believe it?

And this is the thing that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto us by these eye and ear-witnesses, to this end that we may know how to return to that blessed society which we had forsaken, to our own eternal prejudice.

And whence was it, I pray you, that God dwelt among men?

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48289:34"/>
and made such a general dispersion and dissipation of mankind, that they are almost like wild beasts, raging up and down; and in this, wilder then beasts, that they devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which beasts do not in their own kind; and they are like fishes of the Sea, without rule and government. Though there be some rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of a sociable inclination in all men, that shews it self in their combinings in societies, and erecting governments; yet generally that which is the true bond and ligament of men, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can truly knit them together, is broken, that is <hi>love, the love of God and our neighbours</hi>; And therefore notwithstanding of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll the means used to reduce, and to contain mankind in order and harmony by government; yet there are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but continual rents, distractions, dissipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, divisions, and dissolutions in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths amongst themselves, and between Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so that all men may be represented as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tigers, Wolves, Serpents, and such like unsociable creatures, till the Gospel come to tame and subdue them, as it is often holden out in the Prophets, <hi>Isai.</hi> 2.4. and 11.6, 7, 8. and 65.25.</p>
            <p>Now indeed you have here the express end and purpose of the Gospel, to make up these two great breaches in the creature, between God and men, and between men and men. It is a Gospel of peace; where ever it takes hold of mens spirits, it reduceth all to a peaceable temper, joyns them to God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sum and substance of it is the love of God to mankind, and proposed for this end, to engage the love of man again; and love is the glew, the cement that alone will conjoyn hearts unto this fellowship. It is a strange thing, and much to be lamented, that Christendome should be <hi>a field of blood,</hi> an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> beyond other places of the world: that where the Gospel is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be received, that men have so far put off even humanity, as thus to bite and devour one another.

And it may be judged, that all circular motions are eternal, and so they can never be supposed to attain their end, that is rest and tranquillity; therefore a soul thus carried in a round, by the vain imaginations of his heart, is likely never to settle and find solid rest and peace. Nay, how is it possible that they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the soul is framed with a higher ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and can no more be satiated with visible things, then a man that is hungry can be satisfied with gold; and besides, it is immortal, and must

have something to survive all the changes of time, and therefore is likely to rest no where but in that which hath eternal stability. Now though these things cannot truly fill the heart, yet they swell the belly, like the east wind, or like the prodigals husks, fill it with wind, which causeth many torments and distempers in the soul; and though they cannot give ease, yet <hi>they may be as thorns to prick and pierce a man through with many sorrows,</hi> as our Saviour speaks: so that there is no more wisdom or gain in this, then in gathering an armfull of thorns, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing and preassing hard unto them, the more hardly and strongly we grip them, the more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously they pierce us; or as if a man would fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Another way we have of apprehending him, by way of Negation, denying all the imperfections of the creatures, and removing them an infinit distance from him, and truly, though this be an imperfection in knowledge, yet it is the greatest knowledge we can attain to, to know rather what he is not, then what he is: He is not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any place, nor bounded with any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and degre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48289:61"/>Those that delude themselves in this matter, are of two kinds, the generality pretend to Christianity in general, and to an interest in sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but if we descend into the chief parts and members of Christianity, as holiness, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God, walking after the Spirit, and such like, these they do not so much as pretend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> they are not such, because they never professed to be such: others again, though fewer, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend even to these higher points of Christianity, as communion with God, walking after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and indeed in this they are more consonant to their profession of Christianity: But, as the Apostle saith, there may be a practical li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I would speak a word by way of preparation to you who are of the first sort, that is the very multitude of professing Christians, because you do not profess so much as others, and do not give out your selves for the students of holiness, you think your selves exempted from the stroak of all this soul-piercing Doctrine, you think rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> say ye, Who will speak such a high word of himself as this? Therefore since you do

            <p>But I beseech you, consider what your profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions import, and what you ingage your selves to, even by the general profession of Christianity. I know you will all say you are Christians, and hope to be saved. Now do ye understand what is included in that, if any man say, that he is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, he really sayes that he hath fellowship with God; if any man say, he is a Christian, he sayes he hath fellowship with Christ, and is partaker of his Spirit; for as the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For what is it, I pray you, to be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? Is it not to be <hi>a new creature,</hi> formed again by the Spirit of Christ? 2 Cor. 5.17. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in as far as you pretend to be Christians, and yet are not professors of holinesse, and think you have a dispensation from such a walking in God, and after Christ, you fall under a twofold contradiction, and commit a two-fold lie: First, between your profession and practice; then in your profession it self: your practice is directly cross to the very general profession of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But besides that, there is a contradiction in the bosome of your profession; you affirm you are Christians, and yet refuse the profession of holinesse; you say ye hope for Heaven, and yet do not so much as pretend to godlinesse, and walking spiritually. Nay, these you disjoyn in

            <p>But, my beloved, this is not all that is here meant, nor must we take it so grosly, as if this did only check the open professors of a sinlesse, spotlesse sanctity.

There is something of this, that even true believers may fall into, and there is something of it more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the generality of professed Christians.</p>

Do I not see in man, (in whom the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty hath imprinted some characters of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and honesty) that it is more generous and noble to forgive, then to revenge?

            <p>There is another more suitable notion about the justice of <hi>God,</hi> in forgiving sin; it hath some truth in the thing it self, but whether it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported here, I dare not certainly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ustice to give it out, and to write a free remission to them; since he is fully payed, he cannot but discharge us, and cancell our bonds.

If confession flow not from some contrition of heart, if there be not some inward spring of this kind, the heart opened, and unfolding its very in-side before God, breaking in pieces, which makes both pain or sense, and likewise gives the clearer view of the inward parts of the heart; and if it be not joyned with affection to Gods will and Law, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest love to new obedience, it is but a vain, empty, and counterfeit confession, that denyes it self. I suppose, a man confesse sin which he feels not, or forsakes not, in so doing he declares that he knows not the nature of sin, he may know such an action, that it is commonly called sin, and, it may be, is shamed and censured among men, and therefore he confesseth it, but while he confesseth it without sense or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I presse this the more, because I verily apprehend it to be the plague of many Christians, who have some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral insight into the matter of good and evil, and espy some more gross corruption in themselves, and have some affection to good, yet this estrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse to our own hearts, and the vein or strain of them, the not unbowelling of our hidden af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
