            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O ſhow to the whole world how earneſtly his Majeſty longs for peace, and that no ſucceſſe ſhall make him deſire the continuance of his Army to any other end, or for any longer time than that, &amp; untill things may be ſo ſetled, as that the Law may have a full, free, and uninterrupted courſe, for the defence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the rights of his Majeſty, both Houſes, and his good Subjects.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As ſoon as his Majeſty is ſatisfied in his firſt Propoſition concerning his own revenue, magazines, ſhips, and Forts, in which he deſires nothing but that the juſt, known, legall rights of his Majeſty (devolved to him from his Prog<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <item>2. As ſoon as all the Members of both Houſes ſhall be reſtored to the ſame Capacity of Sitting and Voting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they had upon the firſt of January, 1641. the ſame of right belonging unto them by their Birth rights, and the free Election of thoſe that ſent them, and having been voted from them for adhering to his Majeſty in theſe diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. His Majeſty not intending that this ſhould extend either to the Biſhops, whoſe votes have been taken away by Bill, or to ſuch in whoſe places upon new Writs new Elections have been made.</item>
               <item>3. As ſoon as his Majeſty and both Houſes may be ſecured from ſuch tumultuous Aſſemblies as, to the great breach of the Priviledges, and the high diſhonour of Parliaments, have formerly aſſembled about both Houſes, and awed the Members of the ſame, and occaſioned two ſeverall Complaints from the Lords Houſe, and two ſeverall deſires of that Houſe to the Houſe of Commons, to joyne in a Declaration againſt them, the complying with which deſire, might have prevented all theſe miſerable diſtractions, which have enſued Which ſecurity his Majeſty conceives can be only ſetled by adjourning the Parliament to ſome other place, at the leaſt twenty miles from <hi>London,</hi> the choice of which his Majeſty leaves to both Houſes.</item>
            </list>
            <p>His Majeſty will moſt cheerfully and readily conſent that both Armies be immediatly diſbanded, and give a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meeting to both his Houſes of Parliament at the time and place at and to which the Parliament ſhall be agreed to be adjourned.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty being moſt confident, that the Law will then recover the due credit and eſtimation, and that upon a free debate in a full and peaceable convention of Parliaments, ſuch proviſions will be made againſt ſeditious preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and printing againſt his Majeſty, and the eſtabliſhed Laws, which hath been one of the chief cauſes of the preſent diſtractions; and ſuch care will be taken concerning the Legall and known rights of his Majeſty, and the property and liberty of his Subjects, that whatſoever hath been publiſhed or done in or by colour of any illegall Declaration, Ordinance or Order of one or both Houſes, or any Committee of either of them, and particularly the power to raiſe Armes without his Majeſties conſent, will be in ſuch manner recalled, diſclaimed and provided againſt, that no ſeed will remaine for the like to ſpring out off for to future, to diſturbe the peace of the Kingdome, and to endanger the very being of it.</p>
            <p>And in ſuch a Convention his Majeſty is reſolved by his readineſſe to conſent to whatsoever ſhall be propoſed to him by Bill for the Reall good of his Subjects, (and particularly for the better diſcovery and ſpeedier conviction of recuſants, for the education of the children of Papiſts by Proteſtants in the Proteſtant Religion, for the prevention of practices of Papiſts againſt the States, and the due execution of the Laws, and true levying of the penalties againſt them) to make known to all the world, how cauſeleſſe thoſe feares and jealouſies have been which have been raiſed againſt him, and by that ſo diſtracted this miſerable Kingdom. And if this offer of his Majeſty be not conſented to, (in which he askes nothing for which there is not apparent Iuſtice on his ſide, and in which he deferres many things highly concerning both himſelf and people, till a full and peaceable convention of Parliament, which in Iuſtice he might now require) his Majeſty is confident that it will then appear to all the world, not only who is moſt deſirous of peace, and whoſe fault it is that both Armies are not now diſbanded, but who have been the true and firſt cauſe that this peace was ever interrupted, or theſe Armies raiſed, and the beginning or continuance of the Warre, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and deſolation of this poor Kingdom (which is too likely to enſue) will not, by the moſt interreſſed, paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or prejudicate Perſon, be imputed to his Majeſty.</p>
