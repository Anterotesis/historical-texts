            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ſpoken ſo often upon the ſubject of ACCOMMODATION, with ſo little acceptance, and with ſo ill ſucceſſe, that it was in my intention not to have made any further eſſay in this kind; but my zeale to the peace and happineſſe of this Kingdome, and my apprehenſions of the neere approaching of our unſpeakeable miſeries and calamities, ſuffer me not to be maſter of mine owne reſolutions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96588:3"/>
Certainly, this Kingdome hath at all times ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advantages over the other Monarchies of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> As, of Scituation, of plenty of rich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, of Power both by Sea and Land: But more particularly at this time, when all our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States are, by their ſeverall intereſts ſo involved in Warre, and with ſuch equalitie of power, that there is not much likelyhood of their maſtering one another, nor of having their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences eaſily compounded. And thereby, wee being only admitted to all trades, and to all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Wealth and Plenty (which ever follow, where trade flouriſheth) are in a manner caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble your Lordſhips by putting you in mind of the great and noble undertakings of our Aunceſtours: Nor ſhall I paſſe higher then the times with in mine owne remembrance.</p>
            <p>Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a Princeſſe diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by her Sex, by her age, and chiefly, by her want of Iſſue: yet if wee ſhall conſider the great effects which were wrought upon moſt of the States of Chriſtendome by this Nation under her prudent government; (The growth of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>Spaine</hi> chiefly by her impeached; The United Provinces by her protected; The <hi>French</hi> in their greateſt miſeries relieved; Moſt of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> kept in high reſpect and refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards her and this Kingdome, and the peace and tranquillitie wherein this Kingdome flouriſhed; and which hath beene continued downe unto us by the peaceable government of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96588:3"/>
King <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed memory, and of his now Majeſtie, untill theſe late unhappy interruptions) Wee cannot but judge this Nation equally capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with any other, of Honour, Happineſſe, and plentie.</p>
            <p>Now, if in ſtead of this happy condition, in which wee have beene, and might be, upon a ſober and impartiall inquirie wee ſhall find our ſelves to have bin for ſome few yeares laſt paſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in ſo many troubles and diſtractions, and at the preſent to be reduced to the very brinke of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and calamities; It is high time for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider by what meanes wee have beene brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and by what meanes it is moſt probable wee may be brought out of them.</p>
            <p>This Kingdome never injoy'd ſo univerſall a peace, neither hath it any viſible enemy in the whole world either Infidell or Chriſtian: Our Enemies are only of our owne houſe, ſuch as our owne diſſentions, jealouſies, and diſtractions, have raiſed up: And certainly where they are found (eſpecially betwixt a King and his people) no other cauſe of the unhappineſſe and miſery of a State need to be ſought after: For civill diſcord is a plentifull Sourſe, from whence all miſeries and miſchiefes flow into a Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The Scripture telleth us of the ſtrength of a little City united, and of the inſtabilitie of a Kingdome divided within it ſelfe; So that upon a prudent inquirie, wee may aſſigne our owne jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and diſcords, for the chiefe cauſe of our paſt and preſent troubles, and of our future feares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96588:4"/>
It muſt be confeſſed, that by the counſell and conduct of evill Miniſters, the Subject had cauſe to thinke their juſt liberties invaded; And from thence have our former diſtempers growne: For it is in the body politique of a Monarchie, as in another Naturall body, the health whereof is defined to be, <hi>Partium Corporis aequa temperies,</hi> an equall temper of the parts: So likewiſe, a State is well in health and well diſpoſed, when Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power, and common right, are equally bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced, and kept in an eaven temper by juſt and equitable rules.</p>
            <p>And truly, <hi>(My Lords)</hi> by the goodneſſe of his Majeſtie, and by the prudent endeavour of the Parliament, this State is almoſt reduced to that equall, and eaven temper, and our ſickneſſe is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continued out of fancie and conceipt (I meane feares and jealouſies) then out of any reall diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or defect.</p>
            <p>I well remember, That before the beginning of this Parliament, ſome Noble Lords preſented a Petition unto the King, and in that Petition did ſet downe all or moſt of the grievances and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers of the Kingdome, which then occurred to them. To theſe (as I conceive) the Parliament have procured from his Majeſtie ſuch redreſſes as are to their good ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Many other things for the eaſe, ſecuritie, and comfort of the ſubject, have been, by their great induſtrie, found and propounded, and by his Majeſties goodneſſe condeſcended unto. And now wee are come ſo neere the happineſſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96588:4"/>
the moſt free and moſt ſetled Nation in the Chriſtian world; Our dangers and miſeries will grow greater and neerer unto us every day then other if they be not prevented.</p>
            <p>The King on his part offereth to concurre with us in the ſetling of all the liberties and immunities either for the proprietie of our goods, or libertie of our perſons, which wee have received from our aunceſtors, or which himſelfe hath granted unto us; And what ſhall yet remaine for the good and comfort of his Subjects, He is willing to hearken to all our juſt and reaſonable propoſitions: And for the eſtabliſhing of the true Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he wooes us to it: And the wiſdome and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie of the Parliament hath now put it in a hopefull way.</p>
            <p>The rule of his government, he profeſſeth, ſhall be, The Lawes of the Kingdome, And for the comforting and ſecuring of us he offereth a more large and more generall pardon then hath beene granted by any of his Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>And truly <hi>(My Lords)</hi> This is all, that ever was or can be pretended unto by us.</p>
            <p>Wee, on the other ſide make profeſſion, That wee intend to make his Majeſtie a glorious King, To endeavour to ſupport his dignitie, and to pay unto him that duty and obedience, which, by our Allegeance, ſeverall Oathes, and late Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation wee owe unto him, and to maintaine all his juſt Regalities and Prerogatives, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be as much as his Majeſtie will expect from us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96588:5"/>
So that <hi>(My Lords)</hi> wee (being both thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally agreed of that which in the generall would make both the King and people happy) ſhall be moſt unfortunate, if wee ſhall not bring both inclinations and indeavours ſo to propound and ſettle particulars, as both King and people may know what will give them mutuall ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which certainly muſt be the firſt ſtepp to the ſetling of a right underſtanding betwixt them. And in this I ſhould not conceive any great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if it were once put into a way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the greateſt difficultie may ſeeme to be, how that which may be ſetled and agreed upon may be ſecured. This is, commonly, the laſt point in Treaties betwixt Princes, and of the greateſt niceneſſe, But much more betwixt a King and his Subjects, where that confidence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe which ſhould be betwixt them, is once loſt: And to ſpeake cleerely, I feare, that this may be our caſe, And herein may conſiſt the chiefeſt difficulty of accommodation: For it is much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to compoſe differences ariſing from reaſon (yea even from wrongs then it is to ſatisfy jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which ariſing out of the diffidence &amp; diſtruſt, grow and are varied upon every occaſion.</p>
            <p>But <hi>(My Lords)</hi> if there be no indeavours to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and remove them, they will every day increaſe and gather ſtrength; Nay, they are already grown to that height, and the mutuall replies to thoſe direct termes of oppoſition, That if wee make not a preſent ſtop, it is to be feared, it will ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily paſſe further then verball conteſtations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96588:5"/>
I obſerve in ſome of His Majeſties Anſwers, a Civill Warre ſpoken of. I confeſſe it is a word of horror to me who have been an eye-witneſſe of thoſe unexpreſſible calamities, that (in a ſhort time) the moſt plentifull, and flouriſhing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Europe have been brought unto by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine warre.</p>
            <p>I further obſerve, that His Majeſty proteſteth againſt the miſeries that may enſue by a Warre, and that he is cleare of them. It is true, that a proteſtation of that kinde is no actuall denouncing of Warre, but it is the very next degree to it, <hi>Vltima admonitio,</hi> as the Civilians terme it, The laſt admonition; So that we are upon the very brink of our miſeries; It is better keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of them, then getting out of them: And in a State, the Wiſdome of Prevention, is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beyond the Wiſdome of Remedies. If for the ſins of this Nation, theſe miſunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings ſhould produce the leaſt Act of Hoſtility, it is not almoſt to be beleeved, how impoſſible it were to put any ſtay to our miſeries: For a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Warre admits of none of thoſe Conditions, or Quarter, by which cruelty and bloud are amongſt other Enemies kept from extremiries; Nay, if it ſhould but ſo happen (which God of his goodneſſe avert) That mutually Forces, and Armies ſhould be raiſed, Jealouſies and Feares would be ſo much increaſed thereby, that any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation would be rendred full of difficulty and length; and the very charge of maintaining them, (whilſt, firſt a ceſſation of Armes, and then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96588:6"/>
a generall Accommodation were in treating) the Wealth of the Kingdome would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
            <p>And of this we had lately a coſtly example, For in thoſe unhappy troubles, betwixt us and <hi>Scotland,</hi> after there was a ſtop made to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Acts of Hoſtility, and a deſire of peace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on both ſides, Commiſſioners nominated, and all the Articles propounded, yet the keeping of the Armies together for our ſeverall ſecurities, (whilſt the ceſſation at <hi>Rippon,</hi> and the peace at <hi>London</hi> were in treating) coſt this Kingdome not much leſſe then a million of pounds. And if two Armies be once on foot here in <hi>England,</hi> either a ſudden encounter muſt deſtroy one of them, or the keeping of them both on foot muſt deſtroy the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>I hope therefore we ſhall make it our indeavour by moderation, and calmneſſe, yet to put a ſtay to our ſo near approaching miſeries, and that we ſhall harken to the wiſe advice of our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their late Anſwer to the King and Parliament, wherein they earneſtly intreat us, That all means may be forborn which may make the breach wider, and the wound deeper; And that no place be given to the evil Spirit of diviſion, which at ſuch times worketh unceſſantly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not: But that the faireſt; the moſt Chriſtian, and compendious way may be taken by ſo wiſe a King and Parliament, as may (againſt all malice and oppoſition) make his Majeſty and his poſterity more glorious, and his Kingdome more happy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96588:6"/>
then ever. And in another place they ſay, That ſince the Parliament have thought meet to draw the practice of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in point of Declaration: They are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the affection of the Parliament will lead them alſo to the practiſe of that Kingdome in compoſing the unhappy differences betwixt his Majeſty and them, and (ſo farre as may conſiſt with their Religion, Liberties, and Laws) in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving His Majeſty all ſatisfaction, eſpecially in their tender care of his Royall Perſon, and of his Princely Greatneſſe and Authority.</p>
            <p>Certainly (My Lords) this is wiſe and brotherly advice; And I doubt not but we are all deſirous to follow it. We muſt not then ſtill dwell upon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals (For generals produce nothing) But we muſt put this Buſineſſe into a certain way, whereby particulars may be deſcended unto; And the way that I ſhall offer with all humility is, That there may be a ſelect Committee of choyce perſons of both Houſes, who may, in the firſt place, truly ſtate and ſet down all things in difference betwixt the King and the Subject, with the moſt probable wayes of reconciling them. Secondly, to deſcend unto the particulars, which may be expected by each from other, either in point of our ſupporting of him, or his relieving of us. And laſtly, how all theſe Conditions, being agreed upon, may be ſo ſecured; as may ſtand with the honour of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the ſatisfaction of the Subject.</p>
            <p>When ſuch a Committee ſhall have drawn up the heads of the Propoſitions, and the way of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing

them, they may be preſented unto the Houſes, and ſo offered unto His Majeſty by ſuch a way as the Parliament ſhall judge moſt probable to produce an Accommodation.</p>
            <p>(My Lords) What I have yet ſaid unto you, hath been chiefly grounded upon the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and feares of our future dangers. I ſhall ſay ſomething of the unhappineſſe of our preſent eſtate, which certainly ſtandeth in as much need of reliefe and remedy, as our feares do of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For, although the King and People were fully united, and that all men that now draw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall wayes, ſhould unanimouſly ſet their hand to the work, yet they would finde it no eaſie task to reſtore this Kingdome to a proſperous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable condition: If we take into our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the deplorable eſtate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> likely to drain this Kingdome of men and treaſure; If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Debts and neceſſity of the Crown, the ingagements of the Kingdome, the great and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall contributions of the people, the which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may not be ſo much to their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (for that they have been legally raiſed) yet the burthen hath not been much caſed: Let us likewiſe conſider the diſtractions (I may almoſt call them confuſions) in point of Religion (which of all other diſtempers are moſt dangerous and deſtructive to the peace of a State.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe publique calamities, let every particular man conſider the diſtructed and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable eſtate of his own condition, for mine own part, I muſt ingeneouſly profeſſe unto your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96588:7"/>
Lordſhips, That I cannot finde out, (under the different Commands of the King and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) any ſuch courſe of caution and wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by which I can promiſe to my ſelfe ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſafety. I could give your Lordſhips many inſtances of the inconſiſtancy and impoſſibility of obeying theſe commands: But I ſhall trouble you with onely one or two.</p>
            <p>The Ordinance of Parliament (now in ſo great agitation) commandeth all perſons in Authority, to put it in execution, and all others to obey it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fundamentall Laws of the Land; The King declareth it to be contrary to the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Laws, againſt the Subject, and Rights of Parliament; And commandeth all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of what degree ſoever upon their allegiance not to obey the ſaid Ordinance, as they will anſwer the contrary at their perils.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe in poin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the King, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the attendance of divers of us upon His Perſon whereunto Wee are obliged by ſeverall relations of our ſervices and oathes: In caſe We comply not with his Commands, We are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his diſpleaſure, and the loſſe of thoſe places of Honour and Truſt, which We hold under Him: If We obey his Commands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leave of the Parliament, (which hath not been alwayes granted) We are liable to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Parliament; And of both theſe We want not freſh examples; So that certainly, this cannot but be acknowledged to be an unhappy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96588:8"/>
I am ſure I bring with me a ready and obedient heart, to pay unto the King all thoſe duties of loyalty, allegeance, and obedience which I owe unto him; And I ſhall never be wanting towards the Parliament, to pay unto it all thoſe due Rights, and that obedience which we all owe unto it: But in contrary Commands, a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obedience to both, is hardly to be lighted on. The Reconciliation muſt be in the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the Commands, and not in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or the perſon that is to obey. And therefore untill it ſhall pleaſe God to bleſſe us with a right underſtanding betwixt the King and Parliament, and a conformity in their Commands, neither the Kingdome in publike, nor particular men in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate can be reduced to a ſafe or comfortable Condition.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid thus much to give occaſion to others, to offer likewiſe their opinions; For if we ſhall ſit ſtill, and nothing (tending to the ſtay of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy miſ-underſtanding betwixt the King and his People) be propounded: It is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; That our miſeries will haſten ſo faſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, that the ſeaſon and opportunity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying remedies may be paſt.</p>
            <p>I have herein diſcharged my conſcience, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to that duty which I owe to the King my Soveraigne and Maſter, and ſutable to that zeale and affection, which I ſhall ever pay to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe and proſperity of the Kingdome, towards which I ſhall ever faithfully contribute my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96588:8"/>
prayers, and honeſt indeavours. And I ſhall no way doubt (whatſoever ſucceſſe this my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may have) it will be accompanied with the good wiſhes of your Lordſhips, and of all peaceable, and well minded men.</p>
