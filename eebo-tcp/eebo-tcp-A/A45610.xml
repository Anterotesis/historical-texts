            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <label>II.</label>
When the Foundation of a Government cometh to be
changed, and the Governours change not the Superstructures
accordingly, the People become miserable.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>III.</label>
The Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> was not a Government by
Arms, but a Government by Laws, though imperfect or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
Laws.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>IV.</label>

The People cannot see, but they can feel.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>VI.</label>
The People having felt the difference between a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Laws, and a Government by Arms, will always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the Government by Laws, and abhor that of Arms.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>VII.</label>
Where the spirit of the people is impatient of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Arms, and desirous of a Government by Laws, there
the spirit of the people is not unfit to be trusted with their
Liberty.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>VIII.</label>
The spirit of the people of <hi>England,</hi> not trusted with their

The spirit of the people of <hi>England,</hi> trusted with their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
if the form be sufficient, can never set up a King; and
if the form be insufficient, (as a Parliament with a Council
in the Intervals, or two Assemblies co-ordinate) will set up
a King without Blood or Violence.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>X.</label>
To light upon a good man, may be in Chance; but to be
sure of an Assembly of good men, is not in Prudence.</item>

                  <label>XI.</label>
Where the Security is no more then Personal, there may
be a good Monarch, but can be no good Commonwealth.</item>

The necessary Action or Use of each thing, is from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <item>
                  <label>XIII.</label>
Where the Security is in the Persons, the Government
maketh good men evil; where the Security is in the Form,
the Government maketh evil men good.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>XIV.</label>
Assemblies legitimately elected by the People, are that
onely Party which can govern without an Army.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>XV.</label>
Not the Party which cannot govern without an Army,
but the Party which can govern without an Army, is the
Refined Party, as to this intent and purpose truely Refined;
that is, by Popular Election, according to the Precept of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and the Rule of Scripture: <hi>Take ye wise men, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and known among your tribes, and I will make them
rulers over you.</hi>

The parties in <hi>England</hi> declaring for a Commonwealth,
hold every one of them something that is inconsistent with a
Commonwealth.</item>

                  <label>XX.</label>
To hold that the Government may be managed by a few,
or by a party, is inconsistent with a Commonwealth; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

To hold that there can be any National Religion or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
without publick Indowment and Inspection of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
or any Government without a National Religion or
Ministry, is inconsistent with a Commonwealth.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>XXII.</label>
To hold that there may be Liberty, and not Liberty of

hath the Liberty of her own Conscience, or that is not Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish.</item>

To hold that a Government may be introduced by a little

               <item>
                  <label>XXVII.</label>
To hold that the Wisdom of God in the Formation of an

To hold that the wisdom of man in the Formation of an
House, or of Government, may go upon supernatural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
is inconsistent with a Commonwealth, and as if one

                  <label>XXIX.</label>

In <hi>Israel</hi> there was an endowed Clergie or Priesthood, and

the National Religion, had endeavoured to violate the
Consciences of the unconverted Jews, these being far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

The right Constitution, coherence and proper Symmetry
of a Form of Government goeth for the greater part upon
Invention.</item>

Through the defect of Invention, the wisest Assemblies in
the Formation or Reformation of Government, have pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a sole Legislator.</item>

It is not below the Dignity of the greatest Assembly, but
according unto the practice of the best Commonwealths, to
admit of any man that is able to propose to them, for the
good of his Country.</item>

                  <label>CXVIII.</label>
Unto the making of a well-ordered Commonwealth, there
goeth little more of pains or charge, or work without doors,
then the Establishment of an equal or apt Division of the
Territory, and the proposing of such Election unto the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
so made, as from an equal Foundation, may raise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Superstructures; the rest being but paper-work, is as
soon done, as said or voted.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CXIX.</label>
VVhere such Elections are proposed, as being mad by
the People, must needs produce a well-ordered Senate and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100976:11"/>
Popular Assembly, and the People (who as we have already
found by experience, stick not at like work) elect accordingly;
there not the Proposers of any power in themselves, but the
whole People by their peculiar and natural Right and power,
do institute and ordain their whole Commonwealth.</item>

The highest earthly Felicity that a People can ask, or
GOD can give, is an equal and well-ordered Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
Such an one among the Israelites, was the Reign of
GOD; and such an one (for the same Reason) may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians the Reign of CHRIST, though not every
one in the Christian Commonwealth should be any more a
Christian indeed, then every one in the Israelitish Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
was an Israelite indeed.
