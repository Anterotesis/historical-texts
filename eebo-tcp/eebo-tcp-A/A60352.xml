            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>2 SAM. I. 26.</bibl> I am distressed for thee, my Brother Ionathan,
very pleasant hast thou been unto me.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE last Chapter of the former Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> gives
us an account of a Battle fought between the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi>
and <hi>Israel,</hi> in which the former had the Victory,
and the latter were put to flight, no less than three
of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Sons were slain, and alas! of them <hi>Ionathan</hi> was
one; and <hi>Saul</hi> to avoid being killed and abused by such loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hands, took a Sword and fell upon it, which however it
may be by some applauded as a Brave and Heroick Action,
was certainly unlawfull for him to do, wicked and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
whereby he became <hi>Felo de se,</hi> and brought upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the guilt of his own Blood; but as he had lived, so he
dyed under the power of an evil Spirit.</p>
            <p>The dolefull tydings hereof being by an <hi>Amalekite</hi> brought
to <hi>David,</hi> it much affected and afflicted him, he lamented
over them with a great Lamentation, of which the Words
of my Text are a part; and in them two things present
themselves to our Observation.</p>
            <p>1. What <hi>Ionathan</hi> had been to <hi>David</hi> while he lived, <hi>very
pleasant,</hi> and sweet, by consequence his Life was exceeding
desirable.</p>
            <p>2. What <hi>David</hi> found himself to be, now that his <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
had been so cut off, a poor distressed Man, <hi>I am distress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for thee my Brother Ionathan;</hi> for thee, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the loss
which I, poor I have of thee, in whom so much of my
Comfort was laid up. Thou art gone, for ever gone, thy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105573:4"/>
place will know thee no more, and I both do and shall dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miss thee. Although he was sure shortly to possess the
Throne of <hi>Saul</hi> the Father, yet he should want the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Son. By how much the Life of <hi>Ionathan</hi>
had of all outward Enjoyments been to him most sweet, by
so much was his Death of all Temporal Losses most grievous.
<hi>I am distressed for thee, my Brother Ionathan, very pleasant hast
thou been unto me.</hi> The Doctrinal Conclusion which I shall
draw from these Words, and prosecute in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
will be this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> When God doth take away from his own People their
pleasant things, it brings them into distress. Depriving
Providences are distressing Providences.</p>
            <p>If you look into the 13 <hi>Iob</hi> 26. you will find that good
Man complaining to God, that <hi>He did write bitter things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> If you ask, how did God do that? I Answer,
by the hand of his Providence; though he had set down
most precious things for him in his Eternal Purposes, yet he
wrote bitter things against him in his present Dispensations.
He had stript him of all his outward Comforts; his Estate
was melted down, his Cattel driven away, his Servants slain,
his Children all buried in the Ruines of the House which fell
upon them while they were Feasting together: God had in
this way brought him from Plenty to Penury, and from great
Abundance to pinching Want. He took his pleasant things
from him, and in so doing he wrote bitter things against
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ionathan</hi> had been very pleasant to <hi>David,</hi> his tender and
immovable Love had very much sweetened to him the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
Hatred and violent Rage of <hi>Saul</hi> against him; but
now his Death did imbitter his Enjoyments and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whatever he had in his Hand, whatever in his Hope,
yet he had not his <hi>Ionathan;</hi> No, No, He is gone, He is
gone never to return, <hi>He is slain in his high places,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he lifts up a great and bitter Cry, <hi>I am distressed.</hi> There
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105573:4"/>
are three things that I shall speak to in the Doctrinal part, and
then proceed to the Application, which I principally have
in mine Eye. We shall enquire,
<list>
                  <item>1. What rendered <hi>Ionathan</hi> so pleasant unto <hi>David?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. What brought <hi>David</hi> into Distress?</item>
                  <item>3. What his being in Distress doth import and hold out
to us?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>We begin with the first of these, What was it that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<hi>Ionathan</hi> so very pleasant unto <hi>David?</hi> to this I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
There were sundry things which did happily concurr,
and greatly contribute thereunto; so many remarkable things
did unite and meet in that one excellent Person, so many sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Ingredients, as that they could not choose but make
in him such a Composition of Sweets, as would make him
the Pleasure and Delight of <hi>David</hi>'s Soul. You may take
some of them in these following particulars.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>The nearness of that Relation in which he stood:</hi> This
is mentioned in the Text, <hi>my Brother Ionathan:</hi> Not that he
was his Natural Brother, but by Marriage: Not Consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
but Affinity; <hi>David</hi> having married <hi>Michal</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Saul,</hi> and Sister of <hi>Ionathan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But had this been alone, had it been all, it would not
have been enough to make him so very pleasant: Many times
Relations are bitter, they prove Burdens and Vexations to
one another, and instead of rejoicing in the nearness of their
Union, they could even Curse the first day of their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
How often is the Wife a Thorn in the side of her
Husband? such was <hi>Iob</hi>'s Wife to him; the Child an Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break
to his Father? such was <hi>Absalom</hi> to <hi>David;</hi> and the
Brother an Affliction and Terror to his Brother? so <hi>Esam</hi>
was to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> to <hi>Abel.</hi> There must be something
beside the Relation to sweeten it, otherwise the Persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
will be mutual Crosses and Torments, instead of being
pleasant, 113 <hi>Psal. 1. Behold, how good and how pleasant it
is for Brethren to walk together in Vnity:</hi> This is like the
Precious Ointment, like the Dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi> the Dew that
descended upon the Mountains of <hi>Zion;</hi> there God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105573:5"/>
the Blessing. It is not nearness of Relation, nor oneness
of Blood, nor any other strictness of Bond that will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
alone, but together with that there must be an one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mind and Heart. Thus it should be in Families, and
thus in Churches, 2 <hi>Acts 42. They continuing daily with one
accord in the Temple, did eat their meat with gladness:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
4 <hi>Acts 32. The multitude of them that believed were of one
Heart and of one Soul.</hi> Brethren and UNITED BRETHREN,
this is amiable indeed and delightfull, when they Dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
Meet and Converse together, and all in Unity; so
that there are no Animosities and Heart-burnings among
them, no Divisions and contrary Motions, no Quarrels and
Contentions, but Harmony and Agreement, this is <hi>good,</hi> a
lovely sight, God and Man count it so; and it is <hi>pleasant,</hi> the
Joy and Comfort of those Persons Lives. Well then, this
was not all in the present Case; there was not only a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Relation, but also</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>There was in Ionathan unto David a dearness of
Affection.</hi> Not only such as was suitable to the Relation,
but above it; such as too too often is not to be found in an
own Brother. For the proof of this, do but observe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
used in the Scripture for the setting of it out;
1 <hi>Sam. 18. 1. When he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, the
Soul of Ionathan was knit with the Soul of David.</hi> They were
glewed together, fastened one to another, and bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Holy Spirit of God: There was between them,
as the Philosopher saith, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one Soul; and read
on, <hi>Ionathan loved him as his own Soul,</hi> which words are
repeated in <hi>Verse</hi> 3. He did really desire his good as his own,
and sensibly felt his Afflictions as his own, and heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
in his Prosperity, Successes and Honours, as if they
had been his own; they rejoyced and mourned together;
they sung and sighed, laugh'd and wept together. Again,
it is said in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 2. That <hi>Ionathan delighted much in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi>
He was not only pleased with him, but he delighted in
him too, and that not a little, but much: He was delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to see his Face, and to hear his Discourses, and to be in
his Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105573:5"/>
               <hi>David</hi> was sensible of this, could not but take notice of
it, you may see he did in the words immediately following
the Text, where he speaks of it in an high and lofty strain,
that so he might the better shew the Price he himself set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and raise up in others the greater Admirings of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan.
Thy Love to me was wonderful, passing the love of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
As if He were a Prodigy of Love, the None-such of the
Age, yea of the World, and had such a pure and vehement
Flame as could not possibly be matcht: Among men there
was none to be found that came near it, nay it exceeded the
Love of Women: Which may be variously understood, and
is by the <hi>Learned.</hi> Either thus: Thy Love to me is above
that which men have, yea that which thou, my dearest
Brother, hadst for Women: Or thus, That Love, which
was in thine heart unto me, was above the Love which is
in the Heart of Women themselves. Tho' they have strong
Affections, and violent Passions, yet they come short of
thine, are not to be compar'd with thine; the most endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wives do not love their Husbands, the most affectionate
Mothers do not love their Children, the fruit of their own
Wombs, at such a rate, to such a degree, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> did
his <hi>David.</hi> Now this could not but make him very pleasant,
for Love is the Beauty of all Relations, it puts a sweetness
into, and a gloss upon all Societies; yea it is the Glory of
Heaven it self, where it is advanced to, and shall Eternally
continue in it's highest Perfection, without the least languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or diminution. But further, This Love of <hi>Ionathan</hi> to
<hi>David</hi> was not dull and sluggish, a sleepy habit, but lively
and active, hastily catching at, and laying hold upon all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
offered for the venting and expressing of it's self.
And therefore,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Love of Ionathan did signally evidence its self in
a way of Self denyal, and by the unparallel'd humility of his Spirit.</hi>
He was no conceited and lofty Person, puffed up with Pride,
wholly confin'd to his own Interest, and looking with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
or jealousie upon them who were below him; but
most readily yielding to the interest of his Brother, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105573:6"/>
cheerfully welcoming and embracing all means of promoting
it. We may learn this from 1 <hi>Sam. 18. 4. Ionathan stript
himself of his Robe that was upon him, and gave it to David,
and his Garments, even to his Sword, and to his Bow, and to his
Girdle.</hi> Good Man, he now would have his <hi>David</hi> go like
himself, arrayed in a Courtly Habit, as became the Son-in-law
to a King: He must put off the Shepherd, and put on
the Prince, yea he should have his own Robe; that all who
met with him might see <hi>Ionathan</hi> in him, and accordingly
respect and honour him as another <hi>Ionathan;</hi> yea, he gave
him his very Girdle, or Belt, which was a great Ensign, or
Badge of Honour, and the principal Ornament of a Souldier;
thus he accounted nothing too good or too great for <hi>David.</hi>
And tho' he full well knew that <hi>David</hi> should succeed his
Father in the Throne, and be King in <hi>Israel,</hi> yet he had no
rising of Heart against it, he did not at all envy him that
Royal Preferment: No, no; 1 <hi>Sam. 23. 16. He went to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Wood, and strengthened his hand in God:</hi> i. e. with the
gracious Promises that God had given him, putting him in
mind of former Assurances he had received, as is clear from
the 17th. <hi>Verse, He said unto him, fear not, for the hand of
Saul my Father shall not find thee, and thou shalt be King over
Israel, and I shall be next unto thee:</hi> He was very well content
not to insist upon the <hi>Right Line,</hi> but tho' as Prince, Heir
of the Crown, yet to resign it to <hi>David,</hi> and to be himself
his Inferior and Subject: Nor was he at all heated in his Spirit
against him, or alienated from him in Affection by his Fathers
angry taunts, and upbraiding him with his <hi>having chosen the
Son of Iesse to his own confusion, and to the confusion of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
nakedness.</hi> As if he should have said, Thou dost by this
means expose thy self and thy Mother to reproach, none will
look upon thee as my Son, but a Bastard, and of some mean
and base Original.</p>
            <p>Fourthy, <hi>Ionathan was true, and immoveably faithful to the
interest of David.</hi> He was a cordial and sincere Friend, as
did appear by his stedfastness: As he was united to him in
Affection, so he would bind himself to him yet faster by a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105573:6"/>
Covenant. As in the 1 <hi>Sam. 18. 3. Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi>
made a Covenant, and they did again renew it, in the 20 <hi>ch.</hi>
12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, Verses. Thus he added Obligation
to Obligation, as if he thought he could never lay bonds
enough upon himself, nor give unto <hi>David</hi> sufficient assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his Sincerity and Faithfulness, and that never dying
Friendship and Kindness which he had with, and for him:
He so loved <hi>David,</hi> that he feared himself, and was jealous
of his own Heart, lest it should afterward prove false and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,
and therefore he would bind it to its good Behaviour.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Such was the Love of Ionathan to David, that it put
him upon being his Advocate.</hi> Oh how ready and forward was
he at every turn to appear on his behalf, and plead his Cause
with his angry Father, tho' he knew him to be very jealous
of him, and desperately enraged and set against him, and
could not but foresee that his standing up on his behalf would
certainly bring his Fathers Displeasure, Frown and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon himself, yet he was resolved to act the part of a
Friend and Brother to the utmost, and put his Life in his
hand, and speak, rather than by a timerous silence be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto <hi>David.</hi> We find in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 1. that <hi>Saul
spake to Ionathan his Son, and to all his Servants, that they
should kill David:</hi> He gave them Command and Commission
to do it, but notwithstanding this, we read in the <hi>4th.</hi> Verse
of the same Chapter, that <hi>Ionathan spake good of David unto
Saul his Father, and said unto him, Let not the King sin against
his Servant, even against David, because he hath not sinned
against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very
good.</hi> It was an argument of dear Love, and a brave
Spirit, to speak so to his Father at such a time. And he
did the like again in the 1 <hi>Sam. 20. 31, 32. As long,</hi> saith
<hi>Saul, as the Son of Iesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not
be established, nor thy Kingdom, wherefore now send, and fetch
him to me, for he shall surely dye.</hi> What now! this went to
<hi>Ionathans</hi> Heart, it was as a Sword in his Bones, the Fire
burned; <hi>Then spake he with his tongue, and said unto his Father,
wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?</hi> i. e. What Evil
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105573:7"/>
hath he done, what one thing hath he done for which he
deserves to dye? And it is said, <hi>ver. 34. He did eat no meat
the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David:</hi> He
could not but think of <hi>David</hi>'s Case, and when he did think
of it, it could not be without great sadness.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I shall add but this one thing further, <hi>Ionathan
was unto his David a ready and faithful Counsellor:</hi> Ready to
give him timely notice of any danger that threatned him,
and to acquaint him with the true state of things, and how
matters went as to him, and to afford him the best Advice
he could for the steering of his Course, and preservation of
himself in so critical a time. Thus in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 2.
When <hi>Saul</hi> had declar'd his Will to have him butcher'd, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>
told him, <hi>My Father seeketh to kill thee;</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
directed him what to do, <hi>I pray thee, take heed to thy self until
the morrow, and abide in a secret place, and hide thy self.</hi> And
again afterward in the <hi>20th.</hi> Chapter, by the Arrows which
he shot, and the words which he spake to the Lad, he gave
him to understand how exceeding hazardous his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
thereabout would be, and how necessary it was for
him to provide for his own Security as well as he could, and
with all possible speed; <hi>Make speed, haste, stay not.</hi> Shall we
now take all these six Particulars, and bind them up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
thus: Since <hi>Ionathan</hi> was in so near a Relation to
<hi>David</hi> as his Brother, and did bear him such a sincere and
entire Affection, could freely wave his own Interest, and
lay it at the foot of <hi>David,</hi> continued so faithful to him,
and at all times ready to plead for him, and carefull to give
him the best Advice and counsel that he could, he must needs
be very pleasant, exceeding desireable and delightful, he was
very loving, and therefore very lovely.</p>
            <p>But alas! <hi>David</hi> was not always to have his <hi>Ionathan;</hi> the
knot is soon untied that had united and coupled this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
pair. <hi>Ionathan</hi> hath breath'd his last, his Soul hath
made it's escape out of his wounded Body, and taken its
flight into the other World. <hi>He is slain in his high places,</hi> and
that brought <hi>David</hi> into distress; and it brings me to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105573:7"/>
thing which I promised to enquire into, <hi>viz.</hi> What
was there in the Case, that <hi>David</hi> should be so distressed?
What Reason was there, that so Good a Man should be in
such a plunge? Time was when we found him at <hi>Ziklag,
1 Sam.</hi> 30. which was burnt by the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> the Wives,
and Sons and Daughters were taken Captives, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
spake of stoning him, and then he pluck'd up a brave
Spirit, and <hi>encouraged himself in the Lord God.</hi> How then
comes it to pass that upon this Occasion, tho' sad enough,
he cryeth out of his being distressed? I shall give you my
Answer in these three things.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>I do not think he was brought into Distress by any Fears
or dark Apprehensions concerning the Eternal State into which</hi>
Jonathan <hi>was now enter'd:</hi> Surely he did not question but he
was now in the Bosom of Divine Love, though he had fallen
by the Cruel hand of a barbarous Enemy, for he was a good
Man; whosoever reads the Story of his Life, and considers his
Spirit and Carriage, will find therein sufficient reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him not only truly gracious, but a Person of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and more than ordinary Spirit, and from thence gather
whatever was his <hi>Exit</hi> out of this World, He <hi>had an entrance
ministred to him abundantly into the glorious Kingdom of his
God and Saviour:</hi> His dying upon the <hi>Mountains of Gilboa,</hi>
could not at all hinder his direct, speedy, and joyfull ascent
to <hi>the Mountains of Myrrhe and Beds of Spices,</hi> where he shall
take a sweet and undisturbed repose to all everlasting. He
had indeed his Head not incircled with a Crown, but laid
in the Dust, and so the earthly Throne was left for <hi>David</hi>
to fill, but he was advanced to one much above it, a Throne
of Glory in Heaven. I do not in the least doubt that <hi>David</hi>
was abundantly satisfi'd about the happy Exchange <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
had made, and the goodness of that Condition in which
he now was, that if he might return again to be as he was
before, he would not; nor leave the clear Vision, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Communion with the <hi>Son and Lord of David,</hi> for
a fresh and further Enjoyment of <hi>David</hi> himself. Instead of
making a descent to this lower, dirty and troublesom World,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105573:8"/>
he would choose to continue where he now is, and take
some delight in the thoughts of <hi>Davids</hi> coming to him as
soon as he had served his Generation according to the Will
of God, and finished the Work given him to do. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>I judge him brought into this distress, by a refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon the manner of Ionathans Death:</hi> That he did not
Die in a Natural way, but was cut off in his prime and
flourishing Age by a violent stroke, and that (which was
Gall in the Cup) given by the hand of the Uncircumcised;
it pained him at the very Heart, to think, that that brave
Prince, who had been so eminently valiant and prosperous
in fighting the Battels of <hi>Israel,</hi> whose <hi>Bow turned not back
from the blood of the slain, nor from the fat of the mighty,</hi> had
now fallen a Sacrifice to their Fury, and was become the
Object of their boasting and triumph. Hence it is that he
did, as in an Agony, cry out in the <hi>20th.</hi> Verse of this
Chapter, <hi>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in Askelon:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it from them, if it be possible conceal it from them, <hi>lest
the daughters of the Philistines rejoyce, lest the daughters of the
uncircumcised triumph.</hi> Poor Soul, he knew not how to bear
up under the thoughts of this, that those desperate Enemies
to his God and People, should rejoyce in the fall of his beloved
<hi>Ionathan,</hi> and with their unhallowed feet trample and dance
upon his precious Dust. But then</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That which encreased his Distress, and did yet
much more straiten him, was the Consideration of his own Loss.</hi>
We all know, that cordial Friends, of good humour, are the
great Comfort of our Lives. Suppose a man hath a great
confluence of mundane Delights, Waters of a full Cup
wrung out to him, more indeed than Heart could wish,
yet would he be miserable in the midst thereof, if he were
Friendless. God did not think it good for Man to be alone,
tho' in a Paradise: He enjoyeth himself pitifully, that hath
not a Friend to enjoy. The Sacred Scripture speaking of a
Friend, adds this Expression, 13 <hi>Deuter. 6. Who is as thine
own Soul;</hi> i. e. as near and dear to thee as thy self, he is an
<hi>alter Ego,</hi> another self, a second self: So that when an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105573:8"/>
entire Friend is taken away by Death, a Man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
torn in pieces, and loseth a very considerable part of
himself. The wisest of Men tells us in the 17 <hi>Proverbs 17.
A Friend loveth at all times, and a Brother is born for adversity.</hi>
This was verified in <hi>Ionathan,</hi> he was such a Brother, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing
<hi>David</hi> in the clearest Sunshine, and under the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Clouds in fair Weather and soul, in Halcion days,
and most tempestuous blustering Storms, being always the
same, whatever Changes were to be found abroad; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tryed by Adversity, was found faithful. When his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was his implacable Enemy, he was his fast Friend;
<hi>Saul</hi> could not be more resolved to ruine him, than <hi>Ionathan</hi>
was studious of saving him. He stuck to <hi>David,</hi> and would
not leave him, any more than <hi>Ruth</hi> would her afflicted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law
<hi>Naomi,</hi> who spake thus to her, 1 <hi>Ruth 17. Where
thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried, the Lord do so to
me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.</hi> His
Fathers Enmity and Hatred of <hi>David</hi> could not part them;
if for that he did not love him the better, for certain he pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed
him the more. His Fathers Displeasure and Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against him for loving of <hi>David,</hi> could not part them:
But Death came, it may be, unexpectedly, and by way of
surprize, and did that which nothing else could do, it part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, and now whatever Friends <hi>David</hi> still had about
him, he had lost the best. He had not his <hi>Ionathan,</hi> among
all the rest he could not find one like <hi>Ionathan;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he thought of it, yea dwelt in his thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, as he could not choose but do, he found himself
wounded, and in pain, so that he could not forbear crying
out in our Text, <hi>I am distressed for thee my Brother.</hi> So we
are got to the third and last thing which I said was to be
enquired into, <hi>viz.</hi> The import of the word: What may we
look upon as the meaning of <hi>David,</hi> when he saith, <hi>He was
distressed?</hi> I shall give you my Thoughts of it in these two
things. By this word he intimates.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The greatness of the Loss he sustained.</item>
               <item>2. The intimate sense he had of it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:105573:9"/>First, <hi>By saying he was distressed, he signifieth the greatness
of the Loss, the soreness of the Affliction.</hi> It lay heavy upon
him, being no common stroke, no ordinary blow; not the
blasting of a sorry Gourd, but withering a Plant of Renown,
a principal Stud was faln. This was such a loss, as every
one could not meet with; none but a <hi>David</hi> could lose, so
lose his <hi>Ionathan.</hi> It must be granted, his Death was a
publick Loss, all Good Men had a share in it, but his own
was more than double. His <hi>Brethren</hi> had a Loss, let their
Eyes be fountains of Tears; his <hi>Family</hi> had a Loss, let them
put on Sackbloth, and be cloathed in Mourning; all <hi>Israel</hi>
hath had a Loss, let them hang their Harps upon the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
but their Loss, put them all together, is not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to mine, mine is by far the greatest: I have lost my
Right Hand: I have lost my Companion, my Counsellor,
my Comforter: My Loss is such, as that it cannot be made
up to me by any Man upon Earth, but only by a God in
Heaven, from whom came all that sweetness that I found in
<hi>Ionathan,</hi> and in whom there is infinitely more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>By saying he was distressed, he giveth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the deepness and intimacy of that sense which he had of
this his Loss.</hi> He felt it, for it went to the quick, and struck
him to the very Heart; this was such a blow as he did not
well know how to bear, he was troubled at it, and bowed
down greatly, feeble and sore broken, so that he was scarce
able to outlive it; therefore here he draws up the Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
spends the strength of his Sorrow, pours out his last
and heaviest groan. We may conceive him speaking thus
to himself: I easily yield some Sorrow to be due to <hi>Saul,</hi> as
bad as he was, because <hi>Israels</hi> King, chosen and appointed
of God, one that had been <hi>anointed with Oyl,</hi> yet I can bear
with his Death; for tho' he was King, and my Father-in-law,
yet he was my irreconcileable Enemy, who hated me
with a cruel hatred, and hunted me as <hi>a Partridge upon the
Mountains,</hi> therefore his Death I look upon not as my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
but Deliverance; accordingly some Tears I will
drop over him, and bestow a sigh or two there, but can
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105573:9"/>
soon wipe mine eyes, and dry my Cheeks again, leaving
sorrow and mourning upon his account as a business more
proper for them who find themselves concern'd: 2 <hi>Sam. 1. 24.
Ye daughters of Ierusalem, weep over Saul, who cloathed you in
Scarlet, with other delights, who put on Ornaments of Gold upon
your Apparel.</hi> You have reason, for he was your Friend and
Benefactor. As for mourning over <hi>Ionathan,</hi> that is my
Province, my Business, and I undertake it, and will go about
it with all my might, there is none to be found in <hi>Israel</hi> that
I will trust with it, none that can do it so well as my self,
there being none so much concerned, none so inwardly sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
none so great a Sufferer, none so deeply wounded, I am
distress'd for him, brought into a great strait: While I had
him, my Heart was enlarged with Love to him, and Joy in
him; how did it flame, how did it leap, how strong was my
Affection, how high my Delight; but now he is gone, those
Comforts are gone with him; my Heart is pent and opprest,
my Sun is set, and I am clouded, benighted, left alone to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan
my self. We have finished the Doctrinal part, and
now come to the Improvement of all in a way of Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And there are only three things which I shall bring in
as so many Corollaries, and speak to, in order to the making
the late Providence and my present Discourse profitable to
you.</p>
            <p>USE 1. <hi>From hence learn the weak slippery hold you have of
all your worldly Comforts.</hi> Tho' your Title to them be good,
the best that can be, founded not only upon Providence, but
Covenant, yet they may slip thro' your Fingers before you
are aware, your Possession is not sure: Whatever sweetness
you taste in them, whatever expectations you have from
them, they may take their leave, and disappoint you, there
by at once proving their own Vanity, and your Vexation.
Hence they are called things <hi>that are not,</hi> because they have
so <hi>little of being,</hi> are of so <hi>uncertain continuance,</hi> and no further
removed from nothing. They are here to Day looking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly,
but may be gone to Morrow, yea before, and leave
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105573:10"/>
you drown'd in Tears: Fragrant Flowers they are, by which
you are at present greatly refreshed, but know not how soon
they may wither in your hands. You greatly rejoice in your
loving Friends, dear Relations, faithful Ministers, but their
Breath is in their Nostrils, and wherein are they to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of? <hi>Ionah</hi> was exceeding glad of the Gourd, under
the refrigerating shadow whereof he sate comfortably and at
ease in a scorching day, but a Worm smote it that it dyed,
by this the good Man was transported into an excess of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and disordered throughout. <hi>Iob</hi> complained not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Cause, <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 17. that <hi>Changes and Wars were upon him,</hi>
or <hi>against</hi> him; a multitude, a variety of Changes, they
trod upon the heels of one another, so that he was at no time
safe, knew not what a Settlement meant, could not say, the
Morrow will be as this Day; nay, he could not commend
one Day before the Night; the fairest Morning he had seen
overcast, and converted into a blustering Afternoon. He that
hath the most Eagle-eye, and pierceth into Mysteries, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look into the Purposes of God concerning his present State,
nor into the Womb of Providence, so as to tell aforehand what
a Day will bring forth. The gross Mistakes of every Almanack
about the Weather, proclaim the Impudence and Ignorance of
the Star-gazers, and it is to be attributed to the Patience and
Mercy of God that he doth not strike those <hi>Diviners mad.</hi>
As God hath a variety of Mercies and Blessings, so that Day
unto Day sheweth Love, and Night unto Night Faithfulness,
he compasseth his Children with Favour as a shield, loads
them with Benefits, and we may say, many such things are
with him, so hath He great store of Afflictions and Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for them too; an House of Bondage, an howling Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a red Sea. Before you have finished your Course,
pass'd through the World, and enter'd into your Rest, you
may be sure of Changes, but none of you can tell what
those Changes will be, how God will try you, nor in what
Vein bleed you: Now through Mercy you have your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
but know not how little awhile you shall have them,
<hi>Ruth 1. 20, 21. Call me not Naomi, call me Marah, for the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105573:10"/>
Lord hath dealt bitterly with me: I went out full, and the Lord
hath brought me home again empty:</hi> The Comforts of Life are
not sure, for Life it self is not, that is at best a Vapour, and
may be soon exhal'd. Upon this account, let the Advice I
shall give in four things be acceptable to you.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Do not overvalue any of those outward good things you
have:</hi> Do not withhold from them that which is meet. There
is a Love and Delight due to them according to the several
degrees of Excellency which they have, and of nearness in
which they stand to you; this is a Debt you owe them, and
what you owe you are obliged to pay, if you do not, Divine
Justice may come upon you for it. Oh that you would wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider how dreadful and tormenting a sting it would be
to you at the last, if Conscience (which is now a Curious
Observer of you, and all the Passages of your Lives) should
arrest you, and say, Man, Woman, thou art now fetching
thy last Breath, a dying Creature, ready to launch into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and to appear before the Tribunal of God; but know,
thou diest desperately in debt to thy Friends, thy Relations,
and thy Family; thou hast lived with them, and conversed
with them, but not carried toward them as thou oughtest
to have done; thou didst not abound in those Expressions of
Love which thou shouldest; nay, thou didst want the Love
its self; thou didst not take that Care of them thou shouldest,
neither Care of their Bodies nor of their Souls: Indeed it is
no wonder that their Souls were neglected by thee, since thou
didst not at all mind thine own, thou wast not so kind to
them as Civility would have taught thee to have been, but
morose and chubbid; at one time thy Carriage was strange,
at another thou didst put on the Countenance of a Fury; thy
Words were cutting like sharp Swords, nor didst thou hold
thy Hands, but they lighted heavy upon the Wife of thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
(unnatural Brute as thou art) whom thou shouldest
have been tender over, and loved as thine own flesh. As for
you that are herein guilty, I cannot but tell you, Your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
now feel the want of your Love, and Care, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but you will then feel the Smart and Horrour of your
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105573:11"/>
having been so willingly and wickedly wanting to your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Therefore amend your wayes, and put away the evil of
your doings from before the Eyes of God; learn your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and chearfully apply to the doing of it, do it all, do it
more and more, take Delight and Pleasure in doing it: Love
them, love to Love them, let your Love continue, let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
convince them of your loving them, that whatever
other wants they may have, they may be sure of this, that
they do not want your Love.</p>
            <p>But still, do not overdo: Love God as much as ever you
can, because him you cannot love too much; you cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
too much upon him to whom you owe more than all
you have amounts to, therefore there give your Affections
their full liberty, lay the Reins upon their Neck; but when
you have to do with Creatures, take heed to your selves,
and love with Caution; let there be a true, honest and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Heart, but yet a weaned Heart. There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Endearing</hi> and <hi>Doting,</hi> study and practise the
former, avoid the latter, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 29. It remaineth that they
that have Wives be as though they had none:</hi> And the same is
to be said of others, Let those that have Husbands be as tho'
that had none, and they that have Children, and they that
have Brethren, Sisters and Friends: Too much Love layes
a foundation, and makes way for too much Sorrow; if while
you have Comforts you are not as tho' you had none, I am
sure, when <hi>you weep,</hi> you will not be <hi>as though you wept not:</hi>
Alas you will scarce find in your Heart how to resign that
which you have fixed your Heart upon. In such a Case, and
unto such a Person, the taking away of a Comfort, or the
dissolving of a Relation will be not as the putting off a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but rending the very Caul of your Heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Wisely and carefully Improve your Comforts while
you have them:</hi> Be as good Husbands as possibly you may,
they may not abide long with you, therefore while they do,
suffer them not to lye dead upon your hands. Have you
Friends and Relations? draw from them all possible Soul ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;
labour you to be the better for them, and do your
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105573:11"/>
utmost, that they may be the better for you; be mutually
helpful one to another, quickening, warming, strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another, provoking to Love and Good Works. That
Proverb is not to be slighted, for Wisdom is in it, <hi>Make Hay
while the Sun shines.</hi> By present Diligence prevent those
idle and unprofitable Wishes that come too late; <hi>Oh that I
had been wiser, Oh that I had done so and so.</hi> Do you now,
and every Day think and repeat the Thoughts of this, who
have Husbands and Wives, Brethren and Sisters, Children
and Servants, Ministers and People; and you that walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in an Holy Communion, meeting in the same As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
attending upon the same Ordinances, and sitting at
the same Table, and let these Thoughts be mighty in their
Operation.</p>
            <p>And as it ought to be thus with reference to your Friends
and Relations, so to your Estates and Possessions. Many are all
the Year round digging like Moles in the Earth, scraping, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and heaping up of Riches, as if there would be no end of
their days, but they should <hi>live here alway:</hi> Like the Horse-leeches
Daughter, they never say it is enough, as some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
think they have <hi>sinn'd enough,</hi> but drink in Iniquity like
Water, and draw it with Cart-ropes; so these never think
they have <hi>got enough,</hi> in the fulness of their sufficiency they
apprehend themselves in straits. Would these Persons hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to me, I would advise them to be ready to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and do all the Good they can to others, since they do
not know <hi>how soon they may die,</hi> and so have no more Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
for Charity and Usefulness in the World. By
Acts of bountiful Compassion make sure of something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
that you may <hi>carry with you,</hi> before Death comes
to take you from all, and <hi>all from you: What thy hand find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to do,</hi> either in Works of Piety or Charity, speed the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, <hi>do it with all thy might,</hi> considering <hi>there is no work,
nor device, nor invention in the Grave, whither thou art going,</hi>
Eccl. 9. 10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Provide for Changes:</hi> Expect them, and arm your
selves, that when they come, they may not do you a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105573:12"/>
Mischief. Do not say as <hi>David</hi> did in his Prosperity,
30 <hi>Psalm. 6. I shall never be moved,</hi> tho' thou thinkest <hi>the
Lord by his favour hath made thy mountain to stand strong.</hi>
Dream not of such a settlement upon Earth, as knoweth no
shaking, thou mayst quickly be moved, and thy Mountain
too; thy <hi>Mountain,</hi> as big as it looks, may dwindle, and
shrink it self up into a <hi>Molehill,</hi> or the hand of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
may take it and cast it into a <hi>Sea of Trouble.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the height of his Confidence, he soon found it
so, and in the next words hath left his Experience upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
for the teaching us to cherish in our selves more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and sober thoughts, <hi>Thou didst hide thy Face, and I was
troubled.</hi>
God doth not need to arm against us, nor throw
his Thunderbolts, it is but hiding of his Face, that is enough
to cover us with the shadow of Death, and put all into
Confusion; and this, or any thing else that God pleaseth to
do, may be done in the twinkling of an Eye: Therefore
under the warmest and most comfortable <hi>Beams of Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
under the brightest shinings forth of the Face of God,
we should think of a Cloud, and in the highest <hi>Spring tide of
Creature comforts</hi> prepare for as low an Ebb. It doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
upon any account become us to give way unto <hi>those
Fears,</hi> that would deprive us of the comfort of our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
nor when God hath put a Cup of Consolation into
our hands go about to imbitter it to our selves with the
frightful apprehensions of that which may never be. But
it is our Wisdom in the serenest day, and when there is
Peace round about, to cherish <hi>those prudent fears</hi> which may
enable us to look Terror in the Face, without being distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it, and to endure evil, without having our Hearts
broken by it. There is nothing lost, no hurt done by a
calm, sedate propounding difficult Cases to our selves. As
thus: Now I am full, but I may be emptyed as from Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
to Vessel. Now I am cloathed with Silk and beautiful
Garments, but God may strip me of these and put Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
upon my Loins: Now I have a convenient stately
House, richly hung and furnished, but Sons of Violence may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105573:12"/>
break in and steal, or a Fire may burn it down to the
ground, so that I shall not have where to lay mine head:
Now I have a dear and Loving Husband who careth for
me, but I may lose him, and be brought to a State of deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Widowhood: Now I have enough, and to spare, an
overplus for the relief of the Poor, but the time may come
wherein I shall want Necessaries, and <hi>pine away, stricken
thrô for lack of the fruits of the Field.</hi> My Soul, how wilt
thou be able to bear up, if it should please God to bring it
to this? Thou <hi>knowest how to abound</hi> with Joy, and to eat
thy Bread at a plentiful Table with a merry Heart; but dost
thou know how to be contented in a time of Want and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and to rejoyce in the God of thy Salvation in a Day of
Famine, as the Holy Prophet could, 3 <hi>Habbuk.</hi> 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Seek for, and diligently look after those things which
you cannot lose, nor be deprived of.</hi> In the midst of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
you live at, as to all the Comforts of this present
World, <hi>make sure of something;</hi> I mean, something that is
worth your pains to get, and that it is your interest to keep.
In the 17 <hi>Psalm</hi> 14. we read of the Men of the World, that
<hi>their Bellies are fill'd with hid treasures;</hi> and possibly so is their
Bags, and their Cherts, and their Houses too, all full, and
that not of Trash, but Treasure: But poor Creatures, this
is their Misery, that <hi>they have their Portion in this Life.</hi> They
have a Portion, and it looks great, makes an huge noise,
but alas! it is only <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>for his Life.</hi> We read also of the
<hi>sure mercies of David,</hi> 55 Isa. 3. <hi>Incline your ear, and come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, hear, and your Soul shall live, and I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David;</hi> now
be you so wise as to mind them. It is very good to be sure,
excellent to have that which is so. <hi>Christ</hi> told <hi>Martha,</hi> in
a way of friendly Reproof to her, that <hi>Mary</hi> her Sister <hi>had
chosen the good part, which should never be taken from her;</hi>
neither by God, who was <hi>too good</hi> to do it, nor by Men
and Devils, who were <hi>too weak:</hi> That was a wise Choice,
be you perswaded to make it. Take not up with that
which may leave you, and which sooner or later you must
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105573:13"/>
leave. Sit not down with any thing that Thieves may break
thro', and steal, or that Moths can corrupt, or Rust can fret,
or Time shall see the end of. Look out for <hi>Christ,</hi> who is
<hi>the everlasting Father, and able to save to the utmost</hi> of your
Needs, and Dangers, and Desires, and of Eternity too;
pray for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he will <hi>abide with you for ever; Grace</hi> will
grow up to Glory, and <hi>Holiness</hi> bring you to an Happiness
that knows neither measure nor end. Follow the Noble
Example which was set you by the Holy Apostles, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians taught of God, who 2 <hi>Corinth. 4. 18. Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
not seen, because the things which are seen are Temporal, but the
things which are not seen are Eternal.</hi> Spiritual Blessings in
heavenly places, and things, are of all good things the best,
and also the most lasting. <hi>Riches and Honour are with Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi>
But what! such Riches as take unto themselves wings,
and flee away, such Honour as is a vain and vanishing breath?
No, no; <hi>durable Riches and Righteousness,</hi> 8 Prov. 18. When
all worldly Enjoyments take their last Farewell, leaving you
for ever, you need not look upon your selves as Persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
but say, for all this <hi>the lines are fallen unto me in a
pleasant place;</hi> still I have a <hi>God</hi> here, and I shall have an
<hi>Heaven</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VSE</hi> 2. Learn, that <hi>it is both the Duty and Interest of Persons
in Relation, to study and endeavour the being pleasant to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Ionathan</hi> was so to his Brother <hi>David,</hi> and by being
so, <hi>He obtained a good Report,</hi> in the Text, <hi>Very pleasant hast
thou been unto me.</hi> This is a fair and lovely Copy for us to
Write after, drawn by an excellent Hand; let us all imitate
it, and come up to it as near as we can: Whether we stand
in Natural or Civil, or Church-Relation, whether Conjugal,
Parental, or Filial; whether we are Masters, Mistresses, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
Fellow-Citizens, or Church-Members, let us labour
to sweeten that Relation, and to render our selves as easie
and acceptable as possibly may be to one another, that we
may not be as Thorns in one anothers sides, nor pricks in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105573:13"/>
one anothers eyes; there will be <hi>Aloes</hi> enough, we had need
bring good store of <hi>Honey.</hi> It is an excellent Command the
Scripture gives, <hi>Follow peace with all Men,</hi> go and do it; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Peace <hi>abroad,</hi> tho' it run from you follow it, but be sure
to <hi>keep Peace at home;</hi> yea, not only Peace, but Pleasantness
too, and both these are to be found in the ways of Wisdom,
3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Prov. 17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths
are peace: See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but
as wise.</hi> A great deal of benefit will be the fruit and effect
hereof; your Relations will have the Comfort of it while
Providence continues you with them, and so will your
selves also: and besides that, you will have the Comfort of
it when you come to die, a reflection thereupon will be
exceeding cordial, and over and above you will have the
Honour of it after Death. <hi>Nabal</hi> was a very <hi>Chub,</hi> a morose
and ill-natur'd Fellow; Well, what did his <hi>Servants</hi> say of
him behind his back while he lived, see 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 25. 17.
<hi>He is such a Son of Belial, that a Man cannot speak to him:</hi> And
what did his <hi>prudent Wife</hi> say of him after he was dead, 25
Verse of the same Chapter, <hi>Let not my Lord regard this man
of Belial, even Nabal, for as his Name is, so is he, Nabal is his
Name, and folly is with him;</hi> whereas by your being pleasant
to your Friends and Relations, you will raise <hi>a Monument</hi> to
your own Honour, far better than <hi>Absolam</hi>'s <hi>Pillar;</hi> and tho'
your Body will corrupt in the Grave, and return to
Dust, yet your Name <hi>will be embalmed, and your Memory bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
And to this end I commend to you by way of Advice,
these three things, desiring you to put them in practice.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Let your Love be sincere, hearty, constant and free;</hi> a
self-evidencing Love, that there may be more ground and
reason to believe it than your <hi>bare say so:</hi> Be sure that your
Relation carry along with it all the Affection that it calls for,
and all the desireable fruits of that Affection. It is this, my
Friends, that makes every thing savoury, and puts a good
relish into it; take this away, and all that remains is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but bitterness. What is <hi>Communion and Cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
without Love, but a constant Burden? And what are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105573:14"/>
               <hi>Services</hi> but ungrateful? and what is it that makes them so,
when they are good in themselves? Nothing but their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from such an hand. The <hi>Conjugal Yoke</hi> will be very
heavy, and pinch and gall if it be not lin'd with Love: and
is there not reason? Did not God reject and abhorr all that
the hypocritical and profane <hi>Iews</hi> did in his worship upon this
very account, because he knew they did not love him: <hi>Isai.
29. 13. This People draw near me with their mouth, and with
their lips do honour me, but have removed their Heart far from
me.</hi> And for that cause he delighted not in the blood of
Bullocks, or Rams, or He-goats, but their Oblations were
Vain, their Incense an Abomination, and their solemn Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
Iniquity. Why was <hi>Ionathan</hi> so very pleasant to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid?</hi>
The words immediately following the Text tell us,
<hi>Thy Love to me was wonderful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Labour for, and in all your Converses be expressive
of a sweetness of Temper;</hi> there is without peradventure, a
great deal lieth in the Natural Disposition. Many Persons,
who are enriched with the true Grace of God, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that, Burdens to <hi>themselves,</hi> and very uneasie to <hi>their
Friends,</hi> because of the Untowardness of their Temper. I
have heard of a Person very Eminent for his Place and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
yea and Godliness too, of whom yet it was said, <hi>Tho'
he had Grace enough for ten men, he had not Grace enough for
himself:</hi> The Soil was rank, and the Weeds that grew in
it got to such an height, that too often they overtopt the
Divine Plantation. Is it not too ordinary and common to find
some Imperious and Lordly, others fretful and peevish? <hi>Some
are Lions, and others are Wasps;</hi> every little thing almost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hingeth,
and puts them out of humour; they are angry for
Trifles, the very wagging of a Feather, by no means endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a contradiction in their Speeches, or a being crost in
their Wills; but all must study their Humour, and comply
with it, otherwise they will be all on a Flame, and soon
make the House too hot: But this will not do, they are to
be <hi>greatly condemned,</hi> and those that live with them to be as
<hi>greatly pitied,</hi> specially those that are <hi>stak'd down,</hi> and must bide
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105573:14"/>
by it. The Lord give them of his Comforts, for indeed they
have Cross enough. As for you that are so much Friends
to your selves, as to desire a being pleasant to those that
are concerned with you, labour to file off this Ruggedness;
rectifie your own Spirits, conquer your selves, pray and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for a Mastery over your unruly Passions. Get that
<hi>meek and quiet spirit, which is an Ornament of great price in the
sight of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 4. A singular Friend of mine, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hasty and furious, attained to so great a Victory over
himself, by Prayer, Reading of and Meditation upon the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of Christ, that none could put him into a Discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Make you use of the same Remedy, remembring; that
which is to sweeten other things, must it self be much more
so. Wormwood and Gall are very improper Means for so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
an End.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Give diligence that ye may know the whole duty of
your place, and make Conscience of doing whatsoever you know
to be so.</hi> Contribute all that is within the compass and reach
of your Power, to the spiritual, eternal good, and temporal
comfort of those with whom you have to do. It is a very
good Commendation which <hi>Lemuel</hi>'s Mother gives of a <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Woman,</hi> 31 Prov. 26. That <hi>she opens her mouth with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and <hi>in her Tongue is the Law of Kindness.</hi> She hath a
Liberty to speak, it is her right, but she useth it with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and affection; and when her Lips are opened, specially
to her Husband, they drop like an Honey-comb: There you
see the amiableness of her Temper and Conversation. But
that is not all, there was another <hi>curious stroke</hi> given in her
Picture before, a choice Character in the <hi>12th.</hi> Verse, <hi>She will
do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</hi> She is carefull to
avoid doing evil, ready and constant in doing good, yea all
the good she can, being, as <hi>Paul</hi> would have every one, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
in well-doing.</hi> Oh! this is a noble Life, what our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>Lord and Saviour</hi> led while upon Earth: <hi>He went up
and down doing good,</hi> therein leaving us an Example, that we
may tread in his steps. Do good, all of you, in those <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places</hi> in which Providence hath set you, all the good you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105573:15"/>
can, fill them up with Love and Duty; and do good to the
<hi>several Persons</hi> you have to do with: Let nothing be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in you in order to their being really the better for you,
their Souls being the better for you, that they may have
cause to say, Blessed be God that ever I lived in such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
that ever I had such a Wife, was married to such
an Husband, descended of such Parents, served such a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and Mistress. You will then be <hi>pleasant</hi> indeed, when
you are <hi>profitable,</hi> when you teach the Ignorant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Wanderer; when you enlighten the dark Mind,
and blow up the languishing Flame; when you strengthen
the weak hands, and confirm the feeble Knees. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, seriously consider with your selves, why God did
make the Woman, and order out the Conjugal Relation;
and we may say the same of others: It was that Persons in
those Relations might be <hi>Helps meet for one another.</hi> And
truly that Person lives to no <hi>purpose,</hi> that doth not live to <hi>good
purpose;</hi> and he doth not live to <hi>good Purpose,</hi> who doth not
live <hi>to that Purpose</hi> for which God made him, and sent him,
and set him in the place where he is: That person who is
an useless Vessel, I do not, and you need not wonder, if he
<hi>be a Vessel in which there is no pleasure.</hi> All that know him,
may look upon him as an unprofitable burden to the Earth,
and so he may be to his Friends, for he doth nothing else
but take up a room, and cumber the ground.</p>
            <p>USE <hi>Third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Since the taking away of pleasant things doth bring Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in distress, we may learn how weak, impotent and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
a <hi>Creature man is.</hi> The Royal Prophet tells us, 39 <hi>Psal.
5. Verily every man at his best state is altogether Vanity.</hi> This
is a Truth, I have searched it, I have found it, I am sure of it;
Verily it is so, not onely <hi>some men,</hi> those that are poor and
sickly and silly, but <hi>every man,</hi> the youngest, the strongest,
the wisest, the most holy; and that not only at some times,
and in some Conditions, when he is diseased and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
but <hi>at his best state,</hi> when he is most himself, when
his Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body are raised up to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105573:15"/>
the highest pitch, and most in tune for work, then, even
then, <hi>He is vanity.</hi> He not only hath some Vanity in him,
some mixture of vanity, some Dross with his Gold, some
Water with his Wine, but He <hi>is vanity:</hi> He may e'en be
defined by it; nay more, He is <hi>altogether</hi> Vanity, it over-spreads
him, it runs through the whole, from the sole of the
Foot to the Crown of the Head he is Vanity. <hi>In se uno omne
genus vanitatis complectitur:</hi> In himself alone he contains all
sorts of Vanity: If any one is lost, it may be found again
in Man. The several and manifold <hi>lines</hi> of Vanity meet in
Man as in the <hi>Centre</hi> of them. The Doctrin we have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of, is one proof and Evidence hereof. <hi>David</hi> was
a good Man, a godly Man, a man after Gods own Heart, a
Man of War, a man of Mettal and courage; when but a
Stripling, he did not fear <hi>Goliah</hi> an huge and mighty Gyant,
before whom all <hi>Israel</hi> trembled; yet when God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to deprive him of his Friend and Brother, to take from
him his <hi>Ionathan,</hi> he was distressed. How great Strangers
are all of us at home, and how much unacquainted with
our selves! It is very usual for good men to be mistaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
themselves, and that among others in these two cases:
<hi>They do not know how much they can do and suffer, when God is
with them:</hi> That which to them seem'd intolerable at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
feels light when upon them; they can sing under
that which they thought would have broken their Hearts.
Hence a good man once said, <hi>I was in Prison till I was in
Prison.</hi> On the other side, <hi>They do not know how little they
can do or suffer, if God be pleased to subduct from them, and
cometh not in to their assistance.</hi> This made confident <hi>Peter</hi> tell
our Lord, <hi>Though all men should deny him, yet he would not;</hi>
whereas, when the Temptation came, though <hi>Iudas</hi> betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, and the <hi>rest of the Disciples</hi> forsook him, yet <hi>Peter</hi>
was the only man of them that denyed him. But let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the business before us. Afflictive Providences may,
and oft-times do, bring the best Saints into distresses; and
those not only <hi>outward</hi> in their Condition, so that they shall
be compast about with Difficulties, and hemm'd in on every
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105573:16"/>
side, as <hi>Israel</hi> was at the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> but likewise <hi>inward</hi> in
their spirits, so as to be brought to their Wits-end, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to their Faiths end; they know not which way to turn
them, nor what course to steer: They are at a loss both how
to bear the Affliction upon them, and what to do in the case.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Afflictions, such afflictions may be order'd to good men,
as may bring them into those distresses that they shall not know
how to bear it.</hi> This is often seen and felt. <hi>David</hi> did not know
how to bear the Death of <hi>Absalom,</hi> but went up and down
like a Bedlam, wringing his hands, and crying, <hi>Would God
I had died for thee, O Absalom, my Son, my Son,</hi> 2 Sam. 18. 33.
<hi>Ionah</hi> could not bear the non-fulfilling of his Prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Destruction of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> nor the withering of his
Gourd, for <hi>he would have had God take his Life from him,</hi>
and told him to his Face, <hi>He did well to be angry, even unto
Death, 4 Ionah</hi> 3, and 9 Verses. Thus the spirit is roil'd, the
Patience is spent, and the Heart fires and flames. In the
73 <hi>Psalm,</hi> holy <hi>Asaph</hi> seeing the Prosperity and flourishing
state of the Wicked, while he was daily under a pressing
load of Afflictions, and the violent hurries of Temptation,
cried out, <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. That <hi>his Flesh and his heart failed.</hi> Have
not some of us heard poor Creatures under some sore and
heavy blow given them by the hand of God, crying out in
the Agony and bitter Anguish of their spirits, <hi>This is such a
loss I cannot bear it?</hi> Little <hi>considering</hi> that <hi>Iob</hi> did bear more
than is laid upon them, and when all was gone at a Clap,
fell down and worshipped, saying, <hi>The Lord hath given, and
the Lord hath taken, blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> Neither
do they consider, that nothing is happened to them, but
<hi>what is common to man;</hi> and what reason is there for <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
passions,</hi> when there is nothing but <hi>ordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</hi>
Once more, they do not <hi>consider,</hi> what the Apostle
saith, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>God is faithful, who will not suffer his People
to be tempted above what they are able,</hi> but will so graciously and
tenderly order that they <hi>shall be able to bear it.</hi> Forbear such
Expressions. The Church understood her self, and spake
very wisely when she said, 7 <hi>Micah 9. I will hear the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105573:16"/>
of the Lord:</hi> And if she could bear <hi>indignation,</hi> you
may very well resolve to bear <hi>affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Afflictions do sometimes bring good men into such
afflictions, as that they do not know what to do under them.</hi> That
is an usual cry, Things are so and so with me, that I cannot
tell what to do: I do not know in all the World what I
shall do. And indeed it must needs be exceeding sad with
that Person who is brought to such a loss: Now I shall say
these two things to such Persons as these are.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Those distresses which amount to this, are too much, and
rise to too great an height;</hi> and you may thank your selves
for them. Be the affliction which you meet with what it
will, it is not too much, nor too great; not such as God
could have laid on, nor as you did deserve: So <hi>Ezra</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
in his <hi>9th.</hi> Chapt. 13 <hi>v. Thou our God hast punished
us less than our Iniquities deserve.</hi> Remember it is of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
out, <hi>all whose wayes are Mercy and Truth, to them that
fear his Name, and keep his Covenant;</hi> who doth all things
to his People with Wisdom and in Love, measuring out the
Potion, and weighing the Burden, that there may not be
a grain more than is necessary and fit. But this sore distress
is a great deal too much, into which thou hast thrown thy
self by thy unbelief and Impatience.</p>
            <p>What meanest thou by saying, <hi>This I cannot bear?</hi> from
whom comes it? <hi>Was it not from God?</hi> and if from God,
it is thy Duty to bear it. The Lord Jesus knew better, and
spake better, when He said, <hi>Shall I not drink of the Cup
which my Father hath given me to drink of? 18 Ioh.</hi> 11. and
<hi>how will you avoid it?</hi> how can you help your selves? Can
you shake off the burden? If not, you must bear it. <hi>Thine
arrows stick fast in me,</hi> said <hi>David,</hi> 38 Psal: 2. <hi>v.</hi> Yes, too fast
for him to pull out with all the strength he had. See to
it, that you bear it becomingly, submissively, like a Child
whose will is bowed to the Will of God, and swallowed up
by it. <hi>Let Patience have its perfect work.</hi> Be the present load
what it will, if you will not bear it, <hi>you take a Course to bring
upon your selves an heavier.</hi> What doth a wild Bull in a Net
do when he tosseth, and kicks, and flings, but intangles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the more? He had better be quiet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:105573:17"/>Again, Art thou thy self when thou sayest, <hi>I know not what
to do?</hi> Have you been <hi>in the School of Christ,</hi> and taught of
God, and yet such a Dunce as not to know what to do? You
ought to know and do too. <hi>Your work</hi> is before you, and
will you not see it? I beseech you to sit down, and recollect
your selves, seriously commune with your own Hearts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Question, What is the will of God concerning
me? There is no State or Condition in which you are or can
be, but therein you may find something, yea enough to do.
You may do something to please and honour God, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to help and profit your selves: You may therein set
Faith at work, and Patience at work: A time of Affliction
is the proper season for those Graces to yield their Fruit, those
Spices to flow forth. Now act submission to the Divine
Will: <hi>Here am I, let him do what seemeth good unto him:</hi> Fall
to Improving of the Affliction, get Meat out of the Eater,
<hi>Honey from the Carkase of the Lion,</hi> that what hath devoured
thy Comforts, may seed thy Graces; see if you cannot by an
<hi>holy Chimistry</hi> extract Gains out of Losses, and turn Iron into
Gold: Try what advantage you can make of the Sickness that
consumes you, of the pain that grinds and tortures you; what
Life you can fetch out of the Grave, the death of such a Friend
or Relation; there is no Affliction with which we are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but it puts into our hands an opportunity for some special
work or other; there is no Condition but what hath a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
duty belonging to it. Do not say, I am now altogether
useless and unserviceable; who is it that hath made thee so?
God hath not, have a care thou dost not make thy self so:
What thô thy Work doth not lie where it did, it lieth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
find it out, and do it.</p>
            <p>I most freely and readily grant, you cannot do your present
Duty, nor any thing else <hi>in your own strength,</hi> as it ought to
be done. You cannot stir a Finger without Divine Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
nor lift up a Prayer, unless the Spirit set his hand to it;
there must be an helping of the Infirmity, else no perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Duty. It is one above that <hi>worketh both to will
and to do, of his own good pleasure:</hi> But however, go you about
your Work, set to it heartily, and in good earnest, <hi>going for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105573:17"/>
strength where it is to be had:</hi> Seek it in, and from <hi>Christ,</hi> in
whom it is laid up for you. To this purpose, for your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
remember that of <hi>Paul</hi> in the 4 <hi>Phil. 13. I can
do all things thrô Christ, who strengtheneth me.</hi> Upon the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
conveyances of Life, Spirit and Power from Christ, he
is able to do the work of a Christian, and of an Apostle, to
resist Temptation, to bear Affliction, and glory in Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
He was able wisely to improve what he had, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to part with it; able to <hi>deny himself,</hi> and yet <hi>enjoy himself,</hi>
when he had done so. In short, while you bitterly complain,
that you know not what to do, have a care you <hi>do not overdo,</hi>
in inflaming your own wounds, afflicting and sinking your
own Spirits, when the hand of God hath touched you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Labour to extricate your selves, and with all possible speed
procure your own deliverance and enlargement out of these Distresses.</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Loss God hath order'd out to you, and to the Affliction
with which you are exercised: Hath he brought you into the Dust,
lay your Mouths there, and lie quietly till he bring you forth to the
light, and shew you his Smiles and Salvation; but get out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
as fast as may be, only see that it be in the right way. Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that a Storm should be upon thy Tabernacle as long as God
will have it there, but command thy Soul to be silent, and still, and
as soon as thou canst, recover the calm of thy Spirit. <hi>Our Lord and
Saviour</hi> of his own accord came to do the Will of his Father, and
without hesitancy yielded to a suffering Condition, not running
from it to the last, but breathing out his last upon a Cross, but his
Agony did not last long; very <hi>sharp</hi> indeed it was, so that therein he
sweat drops of Blood, but it was <hi>short,</hi> and quickly went over again,
and in all his after Trials he expressed a full and most sweet Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Soul, and carried it with a true greatness of Spirit. There
should be in us <hi>a due sense of Losses and Afflictions;</hi> otherwise we shall
be guilty of offering an Affront unto God, and putting a slight upon
him; and we shall prejudice our selves by not serching that good out
of an Actiction which we might: But still we must be careful to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
our grief as much as possibly we can, both as to <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
returning to a right and even Temper. It is most honourable
for the Christian, and comfortable to him, when <hi>Grace</hi> doth that
which <hi>Time</hi> will. In order hereunto, I advise these four things.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Ease your selves in a way of Prayer.</hi> It is indeed very good,
when an Oppressed Person can <hi>broach</hi> the Vessel, and give his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<hi>vent</hi> in Tears: I my self have known some (among others an
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105573:18"/>
Eminent and Noble Lady) so full of Sorrow, that their Hearts were
ready to break, relieved by Weeping, when all their Friends that
came to Comfort them, prov'd <hi>Physicians of no value;</hi> but the best,
and most excellent way, is <hi>to mingle Tears and Prayers together.</hi> Weep
over your Afflictions if you can, but withal go and tell your Father
of them, pouring out the Complaints and Desires of your Souls into
his Bosom. Poor <hi>Hannah</hi> was in great distress, having an Adversary
in the House with her, who multiplied provocations <hi>to make her fret,</hi>
whereupon she became <hi>bitter of Soul:</hi> In that Case she tried what God
would do, and sought unto him, 1 <hi>Samuel 1. 10. She wept sore;</hi> that
she could not help, nor did she endeavour it, Tears have their Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
but <hi>she also prayed:</hi> And O! how much did she gain by it, what
abundance of Peace, what Quietness and Comfort did her Prayer
fetch into her! It is said, <hi>ver. 18. She went away, and her Countenance
was no more sad:</hi> While she was praying, God gave her a Gracious
Smile, a look of Love, and she was a cheerful Woman ever after.
Faith and Prayer will do the work, notwithstanding the difficulties of
it, and scatter the Clouds, be they never so thick. The more a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Soul relies on God in a way of Believing, and seeks him in a way
of humble, fervent Supplication, the easier will every Burden be to
it, the lighter every Affliction, and the more comfortable every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Put the most fair and candid sense you can upon Providences;</hi>
and make the best interpretation of every thing God doth with you.
We should have both <hi>Honourable</hi> Thoughts of it, and <hi>Amicable</hi> too,
for He is too <hi>Righteous</hi> to do <hi>wrong</hi> to any of his <hi>Creatures,</hi> and too
<hi>Gracious</hi> to do <hi>hurt</hi> to any of his <hi>Children.</hi> When our <hi>Lord</hi> had open'd
the Ears of the Deaf Man, and loos'd his Tongue, the People said
7 <hi>Mark 37. He hath done all things well:</hi> say the same of God, for it
is true: He doth not fail in any of his Undertakings, nor miscarry
in any of the works of his hands, but doth all things like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
like a God. Do not only assert this of his Providences <hi>in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
but bring it down, and apply it to <hi>particular</hi> Dispensations. He
hath done well <hi>in this,</hi> and well <hi>in that, 119 Psalm 65. Thou hast dealt
well with thy Servant, O Lord, according to thy Word:</hi> 71 Verse, <hi>It is
good for me that I have been afflicted. 75. I know, O Lord, that thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me;</hi> Go ye, and
do likewise. He hath done well in <hi>emptying</hi> me, for had I continued
full, I might have grown proud, and <hi>denied him, saying, who is the
Lord:</hi> He hath done well in taking my <hi>Husband,</hi> my <hi>Father,</hi> my
<hi>Teacher</hi> from me, for being <hi>ripe</hi> for Heaven, he was <hi>gathered.</hi> He had
finished that Work which was given him to do; and it is more than
a thousand pities that a Good Man should outlive his Work, or stay
in a place where he hath nothing to do: It is pity but that a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105573:18"/>
Servant of Christ, when he hath dispatch'd the business he came
for, should forthwith be taken up to his Rest, and have an entrance
granted him into <hi>the Ioy of his Lord:</hi> Believe this also, That in all
God's dealings with you, he intends you a Kindness; if a <hi>Raven</hi> be
sent to <hi>Elijah,</hi> it shall carry <hi>Food</hi> for him; the very <hi>Rod</hi> blossoms
with <hi>Love,</hi> and bears the <hi>peaceable fruit of Righteousness. Iacob</hi> was
mistaken, when he said, 42 <hi>Gen. 36. All these things are against me:</hi>
Good Man, he little knew then what God was doing for him. Do
you rather say with <hi>Paul, 8 Romans 28. We know that all things work
together for good, to them that love God;</hi> this shall work so, and that
likewise.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Look off from the Afflictions you feel, to the mercies you have;</hi>
from the Comforts you have <hi>lost,</hi> to those that are yet <hi>left.</hi> God
might have stript you of all, for you have made frequent forfeitures.
We took notice before of God's dealing with <hi>Vpright Iob,</hi> who in a
little time was deprived of all, brought to the Ashes, having his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
over and above smitten with fore Boils, from the sole of his Foot,
even to his Crown, yet had he then something <hi>left</hi> him for his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and Comfort, <hi>viz. The witness of his Conscience.</hi> Tho' his Wife
was very unkind, a Thorn in his side, and spake bitterly, when she
bade him <hi>Curse God, and die;</hi> yet <hi>Conscience</hi> was within him like a
Bird of <hi>Paradise</hi> that sung sweetly, while it told him, he was not
wicked, and bare Testimony to his Integrity. God hath taken from
you an Husband, a Father, a Wife, a Mother, a Child, one Child af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, a dear Brother or Sister, a faithful Friend, a diligent
Labourer in the Vineyard: But ask your selves the Question, what
hath God left me? And be sure that the present Loss, be it what it
will, do not so corrupt and vitiate thy Palate, as that thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not <hi>taste</hi> the remaining Mercy: Rather let the Mercy which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
influence thy Spirit to the alleviating of the present Loss, and
enabling thee to bear thy Burden the better. Possibly some here have
lost the Husband, or Father is dead, Estate is spent, Debtors are
broke, Trade fails, all is gone, and no visible way for a Livelihood.
Be it so, yet there is <hi>something left for you;</hi> namely, a <hi>God,</hi> can you
not live upon him? Cannot you rejoyce in him? You may read of
one that could, 3 <hi>Habbuk.</hi> 17, 18. and you have <hi>Promises</hi> left, which
are <hi>exceeding great and precious:</hi> Go feed upon them, believe them, plead
them, and turn them into Prayer.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Often relieve your selves with Meditations upon the fulness and
sweetness of Christ.</hi> Was <hi>Ionathan</hi> pleasant to <hi>David?</hi> how pleasant
then is <hi>Iesus,</hi> far more than <hi>Ionathan</hi> was, or ever could have been?
And tho' <hi>Ionathan</hi> be dead, yet <hi>Iesus</hi> is risen. He is said to <hi>rejoyce over
his Church as the Bridegroom over the Bride:</hi> And he saith, 7 <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.
<hi>How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</hi> And shall not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105573:19"/>
Saints reckon Christ so? They that know what he is, and what Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him is, do, and will witness with the Spouse in 1 <hi>Cant. 16. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold!
thou art fair, my Beloved, yea, and pleasant.</hi> O, <hi>how fair</hi> must he
needs be, who is the Sun of Righteousness, who outshines all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the World, all the Angels in Heaven, and who is <hi>the brightness
of his Fathers Glory, the express Image of his Person,</hi> 1 Heb. 3. And <hi>how
pleasant</hi> must he needs be, who puts a <hi>sweetness into our worst things,</hi> so
that the Saints have <hi>taken joyfully the spoiling of their goods,</hi> 10 Heb. 34.
and <hi>a deliciousness into their best things.</hi> It is He that makes <hi>Truths sweet,</hi>
being the Marrow of the Gospel; and <hi>Ordinances</hi> sweet, they are but
the <hi>Dishes,</hi> he the <hi>Feast.</hi> It is He that makes <hi>Heaven sweet:</hi> What
would that place be without his Company? There indeed Saints are,
and shall be without Sin, and without Sorrow, above Affliction, and
above Temptation; all this is very good, but that which <hi>commends
it,</hi> and is its self yet better, is, they shall there <hi>be with Christ. 14 Ioh,</hi> 3.
<hi>Where I am, there ye shall be also:</hi> And said <hi>Paul, 1 Phil. I desire to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and to be with Christ, which is far better.</hi> Yea, it is Christ that
<hi>commends God himself to us,</hi> for <hi>out of him he is a consuming Fire, and
everlasting burnings;</hi> 33 Isa. 14. We could not endure his Presence.
<hi>In him</hi> He is reconciled, <hi>a Father of Mercies, and God of Comforts,</hi> 2 Cor.
1. 3. So that he must needs be pleasant, and with this comfort your
selves: Whoever is dead, whatever is gone, you have Christ still,
who hath said, <hi>He will not leave you comfortless, but will come to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may now be expected I should speak something concerning <hi>my
Dear Brother,</hi> who fought a good Fight, kept the Faith, served his
Generation according to the Will of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hath now finished his
Course; but there is no need, his Works praise him: You have
known his Doctrine, and manner of Life, and so have others who
were gainers by his Ministry, being begotten, nourished and built up
by the Gospel he Preached. Take therefore what I shall say in short;
thus: He was well accomplished with Learning, and furnished for
the Work to which God had call'd him. His Abilities and stock of
Knowledge were very considerable, as they found who conversed
with him. He was, I am perswaded, truly Gracious, an humble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
a profitable Preacher, an able Catechist, and a Faithful Friend:
He was a wise Man, and a Man of Peace, one that did adorn his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
by his unreproveable and exemplary Conversation. God hath
been pleased to take him from us, I do bewail my Loss, and so do
many of you yours: But he had done his Work, and is now, I doubt
not, taking an Everlasting Rest in the Bosom of his dearest Lord.
<hi>His Faith let us follow, considering the end of his Conversation.</hi>
