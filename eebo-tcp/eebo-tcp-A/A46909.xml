            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To theſe I ſay no more but this, <hi>It cannot bee but that offences will come, but we to them by whom they come. Matth.</hi> 18. 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the wrongers of poltick truth and juſtice, <hi>Jus fori,</hi> and theſe are of three ſorts, I wiſh I could ſay, <hi>Triaſunt omnia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſellers of Juſtice for fear,

or flatterie, or friendſhip, or gifts, for there are more ſorts of Bribery then one; there is fear-bribery, friendſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bribery, honour-bribery, ſin-bribery, and gift-bribery; if I thought there were any ſuch here, I would tell them that whatever the price is, the penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth will be dear, when their ſoule ſhall feel the ſting, and lie under the ſcalding drops of vengeance, which is in my Text, <hi>All thoſe do I hate, &amp;c. ſed Cynthius aurem vellit.</hi> But ſomebody puls me by the ſleeve, and ſaith, <hi>enough of that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, wreſters of Juſtice, who make the Law a Noſe of Wax, to bee ſet to the right or wrong ſide, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their partiall affections, that purpoſely ſhuffle plainneſſe into diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and raiſe ſuch duſt that the Pearl of Truth may not come to the right owner; that are wittie to finde one tricke or other to tripp up juſtice, <hi>that righteouſneſſe cannot ſtand, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cannot enter, Eſa.</hi> 59. 14.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the delayers of Truth, who
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35089:17"/>
ſet men forward and backward, as their men on Cheſſe-boord. O! how many remoraes hath the ſhip of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? It may be called the delay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the ſpeed; a motion this Terme, an Order next, and then a a Writ of Errour unravels all again. <hi>Jethro, Exod.</hi> 18. 14. was not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee Cauſes hang from morning to evening, but what would he have ſaid if he had ſeen ours depend from Tearm to Tearm, <hi>Terminos ſine termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> from year to year, yea Saboaths of years, that ſometime Juſtice doth but bring forth as the Elephant, once in ten years.

It would move a heart like a nether Milſtone to ſee and hear the ſighs and groans of ſome diſtreſſed families, that hath to deale with oppreſſing greatneſſe at the end of fruitleſſe and ſumleſſe Tearmes, that how many

Tearms ſoever they paſſe, they never have a Hilarie Tearm. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was ſo wearied with the Law that he proteſted that if there were two wayes ſhewed him, one to the Barr, another to Hell, he would chuſe that to Hell rather; I ſuppoſe in this he overſpake himſelf. but this I am ſure of, there are many ſo diſcouraged, from ſeeking the face of the Ruler, that they had rather ſit down under three injuries, than require ſatisfaction for one, the remedy being worſe than the diſeaſe. To theſe I ſay no more but this, <hi>Hee that in this kinde hideth his face from the crie of the poore, hee alſo ſhall crie and not be heard, Prov.</hi> 21. 13.</p>

To theſe I ſay, if the lovers of <hi>Zions</hi> peace ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, the haters of it ſhall be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; when God ſhall make <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>
