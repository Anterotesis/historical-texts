            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And yet for all this, verſe 3. he ſighes after a Treaty, after a nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer acceſs and approach unto him that ſmites him; he quits his ſeeming <hi>friends</hi> to make after his ſeeming <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and is willing to make this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy</hi> his <hi>Iudge,</hi> and to refer all to him.</p>

               <hi>Obſerva.</hi> 1. The ſoreſt ſtroaks can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not drive away good ſouls from God, but rather draw them nearer to him, my ſtroak is heavier then my groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet O that I knew where I might find him!</p>
            <p n="2">2. God himſelf, even for his own ſake, is the great Object of a Saints ſeekings. O that I knew where I might find him! not this or that to be gotten by him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Pretious ſouls that have a large <hi>Intereſt</hi> in God, are ſometimes at a loſs, as to his ſweet and ſenſible <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> The great God hath his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known <hi>Retreats,</hi> whether his beſt friends cannot ſollow him. So verſe 8.9. <hi>Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; on the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him; he hideth himſelf on the right hand that I cannot ſee him.</hi> So holy <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee.</hi> You ſee his <hi>Intereſt</hi> is clear; he can ſay Thou art my God, and yet he had but little <hi>enjoyment</hi> of him: his ſoul thirſteth, longeth, followeth hard

            <p n="4">4. A gracious heart ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinks it ſelf near enough unto God, its Sun and Sheild, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: O that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his ſeat!</p>
            <p n="5">5. Gods Judgement-ſeat where he ſits to hear and determine cauſes, is not terrible or unapproachable to a Believer, who knows it to be a Throne of Mercy, as <hi>Iob</hi> here did; for ſays he, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. how would he uſe me, if he had me there? would he overwhelm me with his greatneſs? will he plead againſt me with his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power; No, but he would put ſtrength in me: Happy are all that can ſay ſo, for me muſt all appear there, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 11. and it will be terrible to all thoſe that do not often reſort thither afore-hand.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A poor afflicted creature often
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114856:8"/>thinks he hath a great deal to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, if he could but get an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he thinks how he would order and argue ont the matter: what a ſtory he would tell him, if he could but get his ear, gain acceſs and audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. 'Tis good to have our hearts and mouths fil'd with Arguments when we come to plead and expoſtulate, and reaſon out our great concernments with out God.</p>
            <p>This is the point I pitch on, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell that ſpirit of ſlumber, which hath ſo much weakned the ſpirit of Prayer in our days, that comparatively they are but little enriched by it, who trade to Heaven with it, where God hath all good things lying ready by him, and waiting only for Prayer to come and fetch them away.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt himſelf would give us a perfect Pattern of Prayer, both fot matter and manner, he winds &amp; wraps up all with a concluſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.13. conſiſting of certain reaſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade God to hear our prayers, or at leaſt to perſwade &amp; aſſure our ſelves,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114856:8"/>that he doth &amp; will hear them: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have an influence into all and every one of the Petitions; <hi>Thine is the Kingdom;</hi> and therefore we expect that as a good King thou ſhoulſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and anſwer our Petitions:<note place="margin">Pſal. 72.12, 13, 14, 15.</note> it is thy concernment as a King to have thine honour advanced, therefore hallow thine one name, glorifie it in the Church, let thy Kingdom come to it, advance thy Will in it, ſuſtain us thy Subjects, pardon our ſins, keep and defend us from Evils.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Thine is the Power,</hi> which Kings oftentimes want;<note place="margin">2 Kin. 6.26, 27.</note> but thou art able to exalt thine own name, to extend thy Kingdom over all, to fit us to do thy will; to miniſter to our neceſſities, to pardon our ſins, to preſerve us from all Evils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thine is the Glory;</hi> The hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy Name is the chief part of thy glory; thy Kingdom the prime place of thy glory; herein art thou glorified, when we obey thy Will, when thou provideſt for thy people, forgiveſt their ſins, preſerveſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereſt them from their Enemies;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114856:9"/>therefore do thou all theſe things for us; therefore do we truſt &amp; hope that thou wilt do all theſe thing for us.</p>
            <p>Thus our bleſſed Saviour doth <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> us, and thus the bleſſed Saints have <hi>practiſed</hi> in all Ages.</p>
            <p>When the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had made the molten Calf, and committed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry with it, and God was about to deſtroy them for it, ſee how <hi>Moſes</hi> in his prayer for them layes hold on the avenging hand of God, and ſtays it by <hi>reaſoning</hi> and <hi>arguing,</hi> from the diſhonour that would redound unto God if he ſhould deſtroy them; and from the <hi>Covenant</hi> that he had made with their fathers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.11, 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> beſought the Lord his God, and ſaid, Lord, why doth thy wrath wax hot againſt thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which thou haſt brought forth out of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> with great power and with a mighty hand? (thou art now greatly engaged in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) the <hi>Egyptians</hi> will <hi>ſlander</hi> thy gracious <hi>intentions,</hi> and ſay it was for miſchief with a purpoſe to ſlay and conſume them. Remember <hi>Abraham,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114856:9"/>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> thy ſervants, to whom thou ſwareſt by thine own ſelf that thou wouldſt deal otherwiſe with their Poſterity: and ſee how he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. The Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. So when he would have deſtroyed them for murmuring, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> interpoſeth again for a pardon, and fills his mouth with <hi>arguments, Num,</hi> 14.13, &amp;c. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> will hear it, and they'l tell ſtories of thee to the Inhabitants of this Land, and they'l <hi>ſlander</hi> thy <hi>Power,</hi> and ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wert not able to carry them any further, thou didſt rid thy hands of them in the Wilderneſs; Now therefore I beſeech thee, ſhew what thou canſt do, put forth the greatneſs of thy power in pardoning, as thou haſt ſpoken of thy ſelf, and as thou haſt practiſed hitherto in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving this people ſtom <hi>Egypt</hi> even untill now. And ſee how he carries it again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. The Lord ſaid, I have pardoned according to thy word.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Abraham,</hi> before him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114856:10"/>23, 24, 25. <hi>wilt thou alſo deſtroy the Righteous with the wicked? that be far from thee to do;</hi> after this manner to ſlay <hi>(pell mell)</hi> the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous ſhould be as the wicked; that be far from thee; ſhall not the <hi>Judge</hi> of all the earth do right? And you know how he ſhrunk up and narrowed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, till he thought he had got within the verge of <hi>Lots</hi> Family, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhould afford ſo many righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons as he named; but he was out in his charitable <hi>conjecture;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he had not faild in what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for. He gained <hi>ground</hi> at every <hi>advance,</hi> and God yielded till <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> thought he had <hi>Enough,</hi> and ſo preſſed him no further.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Joſhua</hi> when the people were ſmitten at <hi>Ai, Joſh.</hi> 7.7, 8, 9. Alaſs, O Lord God, ſayes he, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou brought us at all over</hi> Jordan? <hi>or was it our</hi> ambition <hi>and</hi> covetouſneſs <hi>that brought us over?</hi> would to God we had been content and dwelt on the other ſide <hi>Jordan.</hi> O Lord God, what ſhall I ſay when <hi>Iſrael</hi> (that uſ'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114856:10"/>to be victorious) turneth their backs before their enemies! and now they'l all hear of it, and environ us round, and cut off <hi>our</hi> name from the earth; and if that were the worſt, it were no great matter; but what wilt thou do unto <hi>thy</hi> great <hi>Name?</hi> that will hardly ſwim if ours ſink, they are ſo twiſted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo imbarqued in the ſame bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; and though <hi>ours</hi> be vile, thats precious; though <hi>ours</hi> deſerve to rot, what hath that deſeved? and think what thou art about to do to <hi>thy</hi> great Name. thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his ſickneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.2, 3. <hi>Remember now O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth: I have had an honeſt heart towards thee, thou knoweſt it; and muſt I now be cut off untimely?</hi> When all things are ſo <hi>unſetled,</hi> now or never is the time for thee to give Teſtimony to my ſincerity, and you know he had a Reprieve preſently brought him.</p>
            <p>Thus he argues in his diſtreſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> 2, <hi>King.</hi> 19.15. &amp;c. <hi>They have indeed made</hi> work <hi>with the gods of the Nations, and caſt them into the fire, becauſe they were</hi> no <hi>Gods; but

            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 Chron. 14.11. <hi>O Lord our God, we</hi> reſt <hi>on thee, thou art</hi> our <hi>God, let not man prevail againſt</hi> thee.</p>

            <p>Not that God ſtands in need of our <hi>informing</hi> him concerning our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which He <hi>knows</hi> better then we; but becauſe hereby we give ſome proof that we are not altogether ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at home (as many careleſs ones are) but <hi>know</hi> ſomething of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and our own <hi>caſes,</hi> and of <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>dealings</hi> towards us: but I will give no other <hi>grounds</hi> for the point, then thoſe of <hi>Jobs</hi> reſolution for this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and they are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon earneſt arguing God will undoubtedly <hi>anſwer</hi> ſome way or

            <p>Arguments then in prayer are not likely to go unanſwered, and praying ſouls find it ſo.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he anſwers <hi>gloriouſly</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:114856:12"/>from his ſecret place of Thunder, yet not in Thunder but in Lightning, in ſome glorious irradiation, in ſome precious melting <hi>Promiſe</hi> born in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart with a ſtrong hand, and there Engraven in indelible Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters by an irreſiſtible power, whereof gracious ſouls in our dayes have had abundant experience.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he anſwers in ſome <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſupport</hi> only, as <hi>Hannah</hi> after her arguing and pouring forth her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful ſoul into his boſom, when ſhe had left her petition in his <hi>hand,</hi> or but laid it down at his <hi>feet;</hi> though ſhe had no other <hi>Fiat</hi> then what was written on her heart by an inviſible finger, yet ſhe went her way well apaid, and fell to her meat, and her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was no more ſad, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>And ſurely one or the other of theſe made <hi>David cloſe</hi> up ſo many Pſalms with praiſes and rejoycings, which he had begun with tears and mourning; an obvious obſervation, and clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that even whilſt he was on his knees before the Lord, the wind came about and blew upon him out of a

            </p>
            <p>Sometimes God anſwers in ſome <hi>providential diſpenſations,</hi> which both <hi>gratifie</hi> us for the preſent, and might <hi>inſtruct</hi> us for the future; for many, very many Providences are <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and do fore-ſhew things to come; but the language of Prophecies is for the moſt part <hi>obſcure,</hi> and we ſeldom underſtand it, till God interpret it in the accompliſhment; an Inſtance whereof we have in <hi>Acts</hi> 7.25. <hi>Moſes</hi> his defending the <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that was oppreſſed, and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> had a further reath and drift, and ſcope in it then barely, that preſent vindication, <hi>for he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Brethren would have underſtood how that God by his hand would deliver them, but they under ſtood not:</hi> no more do we many times the full <hi>Extent</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> of a diſpenſation which <hi>ecchoes</hi> to Prayer; yet for the moſt part we pick ſomething out of it to ſtay the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and to afford <hi>Support;</hi> if not <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Plead then, and fill your mouths
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114856:13"/>with <hi>arguments;</hi> for when ever you do ſo, beyond all perdventure God will <hi>anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There's no fear that he will interpret this ſawcineſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in thee, and ſo anſwer thee with his Fiſts about thine ears, or with his foot to kick thee out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; there is no fear that he will ſmother thee under the weight of his greatneſs, or dazle thee with his beams, or burn thee with his flames, or drive thee from the Judgement-ſeat (as <hi>Gallio</hi> did the Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.26.) No, he never beats his people lower then their knees, and thence ſuffers them, yea helps them to riſe again; nay he will lay his hand upon thy head; yea under thy feet to do thee good; he will ſtroke rather then <hi>ſtrike</hi> a pleading ſoul; he will <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> thee; and put mettle into thee; this is <hi>lobs</hi> conſideration in the ſixth verſe, Will he plead againſt me with his great and abſolute Power, by which he may do what he pleaſeth with his poor Creatures? Will he ſerve me ſo; No, but he would put <hi>ſtrength</hi> in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114856:13"/>me, thus he dealt with <hi>Daiel,</hi> chap. 10.19.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There the <hi>Righteous</hi> may <hi>plead</hi> and diſpute with him, even at the Bar of Equity and Juſtice, yea and the Judge cannot but pronounce and paſs ſentence in their favour; tha's his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. there the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> may plead with him, and ſo ſhall I be delivered for ever from my Judge, never more dread him as a Judge, but ſo as withal to love him, and live with him as a <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There righteous <hi>Ieremy</hi> pleads with him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 12.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Righteous art thou O Lord when I plead with thee (there's no queſtion to be made of that, that admits of no diſpute (yet let me talk with thee of thy Judgements.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114856:22"/>choſen whether ever there ſhould have been ſuch a body yea or no: God the Father begets the Son ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, not arbitrarily; that is, from his <hi>Nature,</hi> not from his <hi>good pleaſure;</hi> but he chooſeth him to be the head and root, and Repreſentative of the Church, arbitrarily, not neceſſarily;<note place="margin">Col. 1.19.</note> this is from his <hi>good pleaſure,</hi> not from his <hi>Nature;</hi> How free is he then in all his other Elections?</p>
            <p>He choſe in deed in Chriſt, but not for Chriſt; as in the natural birth,<note place="margin">See Mr.<hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Orthod. Evang. <hi>p.</hi> 225. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> ſo here firſt the head comes forth, and then the Members; Chriſt is the cauſe of the Salvation of the Elect, but not of Election to Salvation. Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of the application of all good not of Gods volition or decreeing that good; Election is God himſelf electing: and there can be no cauſe of God; God cannot be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Chriſt indeed was by, but had not the <hi>naming</hi> of the Blect; this was the Fathers <hi>part</hi> and gives him primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and Originally and intereſt in them; as Chriſt himſelf acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>John</hi> 17.6. Thine they were, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114856:23"/>thou gaveſt them unto me. Chriſt himſelf did not propound ſollicite for this or that perſon; much leſs any foreſeen qualifications, which are the effects, but could not be the cauſes of that Love or <hi>choiſe;</hi> and if there was none by to move him, was there any to <hi>manacle</hi> him, to preſcribe Laws and limits to him? to ſay unto him, You may not chuſe ſuch or ſuch a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let ſinner: to ſet bounds and banks to thoſe great deeps of electing Love, and to ſay unto them, Hitherto may ye go, and no further, and here muſt your precious waves be ſtayed.</p>
            <p>He choſe indeed not immediately to Salvation, (that was too great a ſtride at once) but to Sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. not becauſe, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw ſome would be holy, but that they might be ſo, <hi>Eph,</hi> 1.4. The great <hi>plot</hi> was how to conform ſinfull, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Creatures to the Image of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. and this thy ſoul likes paſſing well; go then and put him to it: ask him if he will own this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and ſeal it upon thy heart: (it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114856:23"/>matters not how many men diſown it) and tell him thou canſt not by any thing thou diſcerneſt therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thy ſelf to be excluded, though thou yieldeſt thy ſelf to be the chiefeſt of finners, and that thy caſe is <hi>reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only</hi> for his cogniſance; for thou canſt not fully utter it to any creature living.</p>
            <p>Secondly, tell him it condemning he glorifies but one or two of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, Juſtice and Soveraignity; but in ſaving he will magnifie them all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Mind him how often he hath already ſacrificed to his Juſtice, by puniſhing ſuch Offenders as thou haſt been; Hell is full of Inſtances, full of thoſe ſacrifices; and yet the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Son do more ſet off the Glory of his holineſs then them all, then all the everlaſting torments of the damned.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Ask him if Heaven will not afford plenty of <hi>Precedents</hi> for the like mercy thou now needeſt and beggeſt of him: Ask if <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and many ſuch
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114856:24"/>like be not there with him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If he never met the like ſince the beginning of his Creation (for ſo ſometimes thou thinkeſt) ask him if he mean to let ſlip ſuch an <hi>oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> to ſet forth the Greatneſs and Tranſcendency of his Grace and Mercy in all its Pomp and Power, Oriency and Luſtre; and fill thy heart and mouth with this Argument: 'Tis like <hi>Goliah</hi>'s ſword to <hi>David, there is none like it:</hi> ſee how <hi>David</hi> himſelf weilds it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.11. <hi>For thy names ſake O Lord pardon mine iniquity, for it is great;</hi> if this be a good argument, thou doſt not want one, it ſeems <hi>David</hi> thought ſo, and ſo did <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32 31. <hi>Oh this people have ſinned a great ſin! but here's work now for the Greatneſs of Gods Power in pardoning,</hi> which in thoſe caſes he flies to, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.17 <hi>and now I beſeech thee let the Power of my Lord be great according ar thou haſt ſpoken.</hi>

            <p>Nay, If upon ſtrong grounds thou concludeſt thy ſelf (all things conſidered) <hi>A None ſuch:</hi> Ask him how he will come off from that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, of <hi>drawing all men</hi> (that is, ſome of all ſorts) unto <hi>himſelf,</hi> Joh.

            <p>Sixthly, Tell him he ſhall be more <hi>admired</hi> and loved for ſuch a Miracle of Matchleſs Mercy, then for all his curious Works of Creation or dreadfull Acts of Vengeance.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Tell him it muſt be no ſmall matter, no eaſie, no ordinary thing that muſt beget <hi>Eternal</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and Extaſies, and Admirations; the greateſt wonders of this world, laſt but a little while, thoſe of the next muſt laſt for ever; and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning, and purifying, the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſaving of ſuch a ſinner will Eternally yield Oyl to ſuch a flame.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Tell him no ſoul in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall <hi>admire</hi> or love him <hi>more</hi>

            <p>The end of Philoſophy is ſaid to be to admire nothing; but the end and ſcope of Divinity, is to make us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire God in every thing; in this thing eſpecially, the eternal ſalvation of

            <p>Seventhly, Was it not He who then <hi>ordered</hi> all other things in a way of ſubordination and ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to the Sanctification and Salvation of the Elect;<note place="margin">Act. 15.18. &amp; 17.26.</note> good works then received his Seal,<note place="margin">Jer. 33.25.</note>

            <p>Free Agents to act freely, the will of man to be alwayes free in all its acts, if not <hi>Quoad ſpeeifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> to do good or evil at his pleaſure, yet <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> he need never do evil, unleſs he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: ſo that he is leſt without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
            <p>And all other things were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as <hi>ſcaffolds</hi> to this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; now who but a mad man would lay his bed on the ſcaffold and ſay, thats accommodation good enough; and ſo take up with that, no matter for the building; beg that he would never leave thee to that mandneſs, but lead thee to things, ſpiritual and eternal, by all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and that all things may work
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114856:32"/>together for thy good, according to this ancient appointment.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">We give this reaſon for it, becauſe the Father was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſins mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his work of Creation, &amp; other reaſons are given for the Sons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catnation, <hi>Himmelius Diſput.</hi> 12. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 14. <hi>P.</hi> 130.</note> Eighthly, Was it not by an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between his Son and him, that he ſhould ſit as <hi>Creditor</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Son come down to be reſponſible to Juſtice? otherwiſe there was love enough in his heart, to have let the Son ſit.

            <p n="11">11.

Go look God in the face, and ſay as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.3. <hi>Thou haſt given Commandment to ſave me;</hi> And to to whom? To Man or Angels? No: to me, ſays Chriſt: <hi>This Commandment have I received of my Father.</hi> If Chriſt fail, there is not

Thou canſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt loves thee ſo well, as to lay down his Life for thee: But canſt thou believe he loves the Father? tha's eaſie; there's no doubt of that: Why (ſays Chriſt, when he was going to die) <hi>that the world may know how I love the Father as the Father hath given me Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, even ſo do I,</hi> John 14.31.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Yet again to make all ſure,<note place="margin">Pſa;, 110.1. &amp;c.</note> leaſt the humane nature of Chriſt upon its affumption,<note place="margin">Phil 2.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>All this needed not to engage Chriſt to the work, ſo much as to engage us to believe that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was firſt in willing, as he is in ſubſiſting, the Son ſecond to him therein; but not in heartineſs of good Will, for therein they are both equal; they muſt needs be one in Will, who are ſo in Nature and Being: but ſtill the Father is firſt in <hi>Love,</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>For God ſo love the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> and 1 John 4. 9, 10. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him; here in is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Propitiation for our ſins;</hi> and therefore love is laid at his door by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. ult.

            <p n="13">13.

            <p n="15">15. Hath not the Father (as well as Chriſt) an hand in <hi>ſending the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>

            <p n="16">16.

            <p>Now then though all theſe things are phraſed in the Language of men, yet not without warrant from the Holy Ghoſt, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends thus to liſp out the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

            <p>And though the operations <hi>ad extra</hi> are undivided, but (according to an ancient agreement between them) the operation is attributed to that perſon: the manner of whoſe ſubſiſting appears moſt in it, <hi>beginning</hi> work to the Father, <hi>carrying</hi> on to the Son, <hi>finiſhing</hi> to the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Yea though many diſown and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like theſe things, yet now go, and put them home to God: and if he will own them; and bear his witneſs to them, and ſeal them upon thy heart, it will be ſufficient for thee, to ſhame thee for all thy hard thoughts of him,

            <p>If it be thus with thee, in thy mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,

            </p>
            <p>Ask him if He have not obſerved ordinarily thy ſpirit to be more mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and <hi>humbled</hi> when he hath filled thy heart with joy, and thy mouth

            <p>Secondly, Tell him 'tis true, thou feareſt him (and ſo do all the Saints and Angels in Heaven) but 'tis with ſuch a fear as <hi>enlargeth</hi> thy heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and doth not ſtraiten it;<note place="margin">Iſa. 60.5.</note> ſuch a fear as is an helper of thy <hi>Ioy,</hi>

'Tis <hi>a bitter</hi> thing to thee that ever thou wert without it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.19.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, He knows thy voyce, and can tell whether he hear any of <hi>his own Language</hi> from thee or no, how badly and brokenly ſoever it be pronounced; though thou <hi>chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt like a Crane, or a Swallow, or mourneſt like a Dove,</hi> as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.14.</p>
            <p>Every creature conveys its ſound, its tone and tune to the young ones, and none of his children are ſtill born; the Spirit unties their tongues, and ſets them a crying <hi>Abba Father;</hi> and he knows thou doſt cry ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: not coldly tender him ſome dead prayers, but cry, and not as a thief at a Bar to a Judge whom he neither loves nor hath any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in, but as a poor child when in diſtreſs who daily asks his Fathers bleſſing.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114856:45"/>Perſon in the Trinity to make up the breach to comprimiſe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; who ſhall now put words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy mouth, or fill thy mouth with with <hi>Arguments?</hi> yet even in this <hi>caſe</hi> try him, if he will not help thee at this dead lift, and prove an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for thee; for he himſelf hath pen'd a form of prayer for one in thy caſe, <hi>Hoſ</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. Go then even to this holy Spirit, and fill thy mouth with <hi>Arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Tell him thou haſt read or heard of his <hi>goodneſs, Pſal.</hi> 143.10. and of his <hi>Love, Rom.</hi> 15.30. Not only that which he begets in the Saints, but that which he bears to them, all the world hath had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of it, the Church eſpecially; and thou art not altogether a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to it, and haſt now occaſion further to try it; and hopeſt to find it, no whit inferiour either to that of the Father in giving his Son, or that of the Son in giving himſelf for thee; though He hath not been equally loved and honoured with then, but wofully neglected and forgotten.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:114856:45"/>
            <p>Secondly, Ask him if it be poſſible for thee to be in a worſe plight then when he firſt had to do with thee; and did he then fall to work upon thee when he might have abhord to foul his fingers with thee, and will he now forſake the work of his own hands; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Thou hopeſt he will dwell in thy duſt when death hath done its worſt unto thee, and raiſe than again, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. and will he now forſake thy ſoul and not raiſe that again, now that ſin and the devil have done their worſt againſt it; for worſe then what hath been thou thinkeſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not befall thee.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Have not the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints that ever he dwelt in, had their backſlidings, and finned even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that grace wherein lay their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, were they all reſtored by him, and ſhalt thou only be abandoned?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Were not all thoſe gracious tenders to backſliders, framed, and filed, and recorded by him? <hi>Fer.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ye backfliding children and I will heat your backflidings: Behold ive come

            <p>Sixthly, He knows that nothing in the world ever ſo wounded thee or went ſo near thy heart, as thy tempting and grieving of him hath done; and thou art reſolved never to forgive thy ſelf, though he do, no (as ſometimes thou thinkeſt) not in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly, He knows that thou art to this day wailing, and wondring, and waiting, to know wherefore thou wert ſo left unto they ſelf, and that thou art far from wipeing thy mouth and ſlighting of it; thou canſt not but think that God hath ſome deſign upon thee therein as he had upon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 32.31. <hi>God left him to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart:</hi> and little didſt thou think when God firſt turned thy heart unto

            <p>Eighthly, Ask him upon what termes he firſt entred upon thy heart; Was it not with a Commiſſion there to ſtay, how ill ſoever treated or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained? So ſaies Chriſt, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, <hi>Joh,</hi> 14.16. <hi>And I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give</hi> you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comforter, <hi>that he may abide with you for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou wouldſt not for a world have him only upon the ſame account. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had him in his ſtate of innocency, concurring meerly as a <hi>third Perſon</hi> in the Trinity, but by vertue of a relation to the <hi>ſecond;</hi> and then he muſt never leave thee, he muſt not only <hi>alight</hi> but <hi>abide</hi> alſo, as upon the head, ſo upon the Members, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.32, 33.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Say to him, hereby ſhalt thou know that he is God indeed, equall to the Father and the Sonne,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114856:47"/>and that though all the world ſhould conſpire againſt him to <hi>un-God</hi> him, yet ſhall his invincible patience, and inſuperable good will, raiſe an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <hi>piller of witneſs</hi> in thy boſome, let who will caſt him off, he ſhall be thy God for ever; <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning iniquities,</hi> Micah 7.18. is equally true of Father, Son, and holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>But ſtill thy heart akes and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted,<note place="margin">9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114856:47"/>and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and fill thy mouth with Arguments.</p>

            <p n="6">6.

Becauſe rich men will not give the tenth to God, God many times brings them to the tenth of what they had: God requires a ſeventh part of our time, becauſe we have that meerly from his bounty without our in duſtry, but a tenth of our eſtate making a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falcation or allowance for our pains, and if he gives no increaſe he looks for nothing, now both as to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth part of our time, and the tenth part of our eſtate, the Ceremoniall and Levitical part being aboliſhed, the morall uſe and equity remains to the worlds end, all piety, juſtice, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude requireing it, no Popiſh abuſe ought to take away the uſe, and all Nations in all ages, practiſing this

            <p>And who would repent his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hereunto when he comes to dye and to be torn away from all his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enjoyments? then it is that mens conſciences wring them, and make them fling away apace what the can graſp no longer.

            <p>But alas, we have gotten a cheap Religion, and therefore like it becauſe it ſaves our purſes, though not our ſouls; what praying heart feels not cauſe to bewaile it, to go to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and to fill his mouth with

            <p>I have only offered hints to help on this bleſſed work of pleading and ſtriving, and wreſtling with God (with the arms of his own Spirit,) in Prayer, the decay and abatement whereof in our dayes is looked on as a ſad ſymptome, and juſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed by the moſt ſpiritual profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. But alas, how few ſtir up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to take hold of God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.7. Now it muſt needs be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the ſpirit of adoption is the beſt Logician, the only One, both for <hi>invention</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> it was he that taught <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and others to reaſon with men, as well as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> and the reſt of the Saints, to reaſon out the caſe with. God.</p>
            <p>When He hath formed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions according to his own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and principles of truth laid down
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114856:90"/>in the Scriptures, and made the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption according to his office, which is to beare witneſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.6. and ſo hath made application of the propoſition to the perſon, to the poore ſolicatous ſoul. He will thence clearly and ſtrongly inferre the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Yea, All Hiss Arguments are highly Satisfactory, his demonſtration irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, his dilemmas unavoidable; So that he convinces of righteouſneſs as well as of ſin, and ſubdues the ſoul to the obedience of faith, it cannot turn from him; and in like manner doth he raiſe and refreſh it when it is weary? If we admit that diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Mediation and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of interceſſion, as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Chriſt, ſo this to the ſpirit, not excluſively as to Chriſt, but as to Angels and Saints departed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>The ſpirit it ſelf maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And without breach of Charity I dare be bold to ſay, he hath none of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within him, who can find no help by the conſciencious and conſtant uſe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:114856:91"/>of this way of pleading, if it be not to ſuppoſe an impoſſibility that any can conſcientiouſly uſe it without him? Nay, I dare ſay theſe conſiderations here hinted cannot miſs if rightly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Only I would adviſe every one that would do any good on't,<note place="margin">Benè oraviſſe eſt, penè ſtuduiſſe gravias egiſſe eſt plus quam legiſ ſe, <hi>Alſted,</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaur. arils me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</note> to pick out and ſelect ſomething out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sermon they hear, to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the knees in ſecret, which poſture I judge beſt, both for repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtudying any thing of this nature.</p>
            <p>And let me add, If God will not heare thee, and anſwer thee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe terms; If he do not put ſtrength into thee, if he be not content that faith ſhould overcome, then be thou bold to ſay, that all the Miniſters of His holy Goſpel are ſadly miſtaken in it and him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35. <hi>Caſt not away there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this confidence, this priviledg of ſpeaking freely and pleading with your God, which hath great recompence of reward.</hi> He who ſo graciouſly anſwers pious ejaculations, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.4. will undoubtedly anſwer the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:114856:91"/>powerfull expoſtulations of faith and pleadings of his ſpirit: Forget not therefore how he calls his people to leave of their reaſonings with Satan, with fleſh and blood, and with their own evill hearts, and to come and reaſon out the matter with him, and what he promiſeth ſhall enſue thereon, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.18. <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord: though your ſinnes be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow, though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll.</hi> And ſuch are many of our ſinnes, ſinnes of a deep dye, of a double tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, relapſes are ſo.</p>
            <p>But for thoſe who live not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the lines of this <hi>Communication,</hi> who come not within any of the <hi>qualifications</hi> here mentioned, who cannot own any of theſe Arguments, (if it be poſſible any ſuch ſhould have the leiſure and the patience to read them,) The Lord have mercy upon them, they cannot <hi>pleade</hi> and will be <hi>preſſed</hi> to death, for want of it.</p>

            <p>Thus have I brought you, to peep through the key-hole, through the hole of the doore into the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> builded for an Armory, wherein there hang a thouſand buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, all ſhields of mighty men; and if you have felt your beloved, putting in his hand by the hole of the doore and touching your hearts, your Bowells have been moved for him and will be more and more? you'l not be at reſt till you have been ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing out the matter with him in ſecret daily; And ſo the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a diſhfull of water, may help to ſet the pumpe a going, and cauſe a pouring out to your hearts to ſome purpoſe, this poore thing may ſerve to do the work of a Gibeonite, help to hew wood and draw water for the Tabernacle and the Altar, it may help you with thoſe Iſraelites that <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented after the Lord,</hi> to draw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and to poure it out before the Lord.<note place="margin">1 Sam 7.2.</note>
