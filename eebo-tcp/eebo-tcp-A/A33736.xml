            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE FIRST LETTER OF M<hi rend="sup">r,</hi> Coleman's To the <hi>French</hi> Kings Confeſſor, <hi>MONSIEUR LE-CHEER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Since Father Sir <hi>Germaine</hi> hath been ſo kind to me as to recommend me to your Reverence ſo advantagiouſly or to encourage you to accept my Correſpondence; I will own to him that he has done me a Favour, without conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, greater than I could have been capable of, if he had adviſed with me, becauſe I ſhould not then have had the confidence to have permitted him to ask it in my behalf; And I am ſo ſencible of the honour you are pleaſed to do me, that though I cannot deſerve it, yet at leaſt to ſhew the ſence I have of it; I will deal as freely and openly with you at this firſt time, as if I had the honour of your Acquaintance all my life, and ſhall make no Apollogy for ſo doing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell you, I know your Character perfectly well, tho I am not ſo happy as to know your Perſon; and that I have an opportunity of putting this Letter into the hands of Father Sir <hi>Germaines</hi> Nephew (for whoſe integrity and prudence he has undertaken) without any ſort of hazard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62696:3"/>
In order then Sir, to the plainneſs which I promiſe, I will tell you what has plainly paſſed between your Reverend Predeceſſor Father <hi>Ferriers</hi> and my ſelf, about three years ago, when the King, my Maſter, ſent a Troop of his Horſe-Guards into the Moſt Chriſtian Majeſtys Service, under the Command of my Lord <hi>Duras:</hi> He ſent with it an Officer called Sir <hi>William Frogmorton,</hi> with whom I had a particular intimacy, and he had then very newly embraced the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, and to him did I conſtantly write, and by him addreſs my ſelf to Father <hi>Ferriers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing of great importance, which I preſumed to offer to him (not to trouble you with leſſer matters of what paſſed here; and immediately after the fatal Renunciation of the Kings Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, to which we owe all our late miſchiefs and hazards) was in <hi>July, August,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> 1673. when I conſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated the great danger the Catholick Religion, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties Intereſt would be in, at our next Seſſion of Parliament, which was then to be in <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; at which, I plainly foreſaw, that the King, my Maſter, would be forced to ſomething in preiudice, of his Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> which I ſaw ſo evidently and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that we ſhould make Peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> that I weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Arguments I could (which to me were Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations) to convince your Court of that Miſchief, and preſſed what I could to perſwade his Chriſtian Majeſty to uſe his utmoſt force to prevent that Sitting of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and propoſed Expedients how to do it. But I was anſwered ſo often and ſo poſitively, that his Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was ſo well aſſured by his Ambaſſador here our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador there, the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> and even the King himſelf, that he had no ſuch apprehenſions at all, but was fully ſatisfied of the contrary, and lookt upon what I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered as a very zealous miſtake, that I was forced to give over arguing, tho not believing as they did, but confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62696:3"/>
appealed to time and ſucceſs to prove, who took their meaſures righteſt. When it happened, that which I fore-ſaw came to paſs, the good Father was a little ſurpriſed to ſee all the Great Mens miſtake, and a Little one in the Right, and was pleaſed by Sir <hi>William Frogmorton</hi> to deſire the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my Correſpondence, which I was mighty willing to comply with, knowing the intereſt of our King, and in a more particular manner, of my more immediate Maſter the Duke, and his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to be ſo inſeperably united, that it was impoſſible to divide them without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying them all.</p>
            <p>Upon this I ſhewed, That our Parliament, in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances it was mannaged, by the temerous Counſels of our Miniſters, who then Governed, could never be uſeful either to <hi>England, France,</hi> or the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> but that we ſhould as certainly be forced from our Neutrality at their next Meeting as we had been from our active Alliance with <hi>France</hi> the laſt; that a Peace, in the Circumſtances we were in, was much more to be deſired than the continuance of the War, that the Deſolution of our Parliament would certainly procure a Peace, for that the Confederates did more depend upon the Power they had in our Parliament, than upon any thing elſe in the World, and were more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from thence to continue the War, ſo that if that were Diſſolved, their Meaſures would be all broken, and they conſequently, in a manner neceſſitated to a Peace.</p>
            <p>The good Father minding this diſcourſe ſome what more than the Court of <hi>France</hi> thought fit to do my former, urged it ſo home to the King, that his Majeſty was pleaſed to give him Order to ſignifie to his Royal Highneſs, my Maſter, that his Majeſty was fully ſatisfied of his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes good intention towards him, and that he eſteemed both their Intereſts but one and the ſame; that my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament, were both to be lookt upon as very unuſeful to their Intereſt; and that if his Royal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62696:4"/>
Highneſs would endeavour to Diſſolve this Parliament, his Majeſty would aſſiſt him with his Power and Purſe to have ſuch a new one as would be for their purpoſe. This, and a great many more expreſſions of kindneſs and confidence Father <hi>Ferier</hi> was pleaſed to communicate to Sir <hi>William Frogmorton,</hi> and commanded him to ſend them to his Royal Highneſs, and withal to beg his Royal Highneſs to propoſe to his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty what he thought neceſſary for his own Concern, and the advantage of Religion, and his Majeſty would certainly do all he could to advance both or either of them.</p>
            <p>This Sir <hi>William Frogmorton</hi> ſent to me by an Expreſs, who left <hi>Paris, June</hi> 2, 1674. <hi>Stilo Novo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I no ſooner had it, but I communicated it to his Royal Highneſs, to which his Royal Highneſs commanded me to Anſwer, as I did on the <hi>29th.</hi> of the ſame Month.</p>
            <p>That his Royal Highneſs was very ſenſible of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſties Friendſhip; and that he would labour to cultivate it with all the good Offices he was capable of doing for his Majeſty: That he was fully convinced that their Intereſts were one: That my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> were not only unuſeful, but very dangerous both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> that therefore it was neceſſary that they ſhould do all they could to Diſſolve it. And that his Royal Highneſſes opinion was, That if his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would write his thoughts freely to the King of <hi>England</hi> upon this Subject, and make the ſame offer to his Majeſty of his Purſe to diſſolve this, which he made to his Royal Highneſs to call another, he did believe it very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to ſucceed, with the aſſiſtance we ſhould be able to give him here; And that if this Parliament were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved there would be no great difficulty of getting a new one, which would be more uſeful: The Conſtitution of our Parliament being ſuch; that a new one can never hurt the Crown, nor an old one do it good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62696:4"/>
His Royal Highneſs being pleaſed to own thoſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were but only general, I thought it more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be more particular, and to come cloſe to the Point.</p>
            <p>That if we hapned to agree, we might go the faſter about the Work and come to ſome iſſue before the time were too much ſpent.</p>
            <p>I ſaid this for my Maixme, <hi>The Diſſolution of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vvould certainly procure a Peace.</hi> Which Propoſition was granted by every body I converſed withal, even by Monſieur <hi>Ravigny</hi> himſelf, with whom I took liberty of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courting ſo far, but durſt not ſay any thing of the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I had with Father <hi>Ferriers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, <hi>That a Sum of Money certaine, vvould certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Diſſolution.</hi> This ſome doubted, but I am ſure I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, for I knew perfectly well, that the King had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diſputes with himſelf at that time, whether he ſhould Diſſolve or Continue them, and he ſeveral times declared, That the Arguments were ſo ſtrong on both ſides, that he could not tell to which to incline; but was carried at laſt to their Continuance by this one Argument; <hi>If I try them once more, they may poſsibly give me money, If they do, I have gained my Point, If they do not, I can diſſolve them then, and be vvhere I am novv; ſo that I have a poſſibility at leaſt of getting money for their continuance, againſt nothing on the other ſide.</hi> But if we could have turned this Argument and ſaid Sir, Their Diſſolution will certainly procure you mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, when you have only a bare probability of getting any by their continuance; and have ſhewn how far that bare probability was from being a foundation to build any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hope upon, which I am ſure his Chriſtian Majeſty was ſenſible enough of: And how much 300000 <hi>l.</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling certain (which was the ſum we propoſed) was better than a bare Probability (without any reaſon to hope that that would ever come to paſs) of having half ſo much more (which was the moſt he deſigned to ask) upon ſome vile
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62696:5"/>
diſhonourable terms and a thouſand other hazards, which we had great reaſon to be afraid of. If, I ſay, we had had power to have ſo argued, I am moſt confidently aſſured we could have compaſſed it. <hi>For Logick in our Court built upon Money has more povverful Charmes than any other ſort of Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſecure his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty from any haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard as to this point, I propoſed that his Majeſty ſhould offer that ſum upon that condition, and if the condition were not performed, the money ſhould never be due, if it were, and that a Peace would certainly follow thereupon, (which no body doubted) his Majeſty would gain his end, and ſave all the vaſt expences of the next Campagne, by which he could not hope to better his condition, or to put himſelf into more advantagious circumſtances of Treating than he was then in, but might probably be in a much worſe conſidering the mighty oppoſitions he was like to meet with and the uncertain Chances of War.</p>
            <p>But admitting that his Majeſty could maintain himſelf by his great ſtrength and conduct in as good a condition to Treat the next year, as he was then in, which was as much as could then reaſonably be hoped for, he ſhould have ſaved by this Propoſal as much as all the men he muſt needs looſe, and all the charges he ſhould be at in a year, could be valued to amount to more than 300000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, and ſo much more, in caſe his condition ſhould decay, or it ſhould be worſe than it was when this was made: and the condition of his Royal Highneſs and the Catholick Religion here, which depends very much upon the ſucceſs of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, delivered from a great many Frights and real Hazards.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Ferriers,</hi> ſeemed to be very ſenſible of the benefit which all Parties would gain by this Propoſal, but yet it was unfortunately delayed by the unhappy and tedious ſickneſs which kept him ſo long from the King in <hi>Franche Conte,</hi>

and made him ſo unable to wait upon his Majeſty after he had returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> but ſo ſoon as he could compaſs it, he was pleaſed to acquaint his Majeſty with it, and did write to the Duke himſelf, and did me the honour to write to me alſo, on the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1674. and ſent his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by Sir <hi>William Frogmorton,</hi> who came expreſs upon that Errand.</p>
            <p>In thoſe Letters he gave his Royal Highneſs freſh aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties Friendſhip and of his Zeal and readineſs to comply with every thing his Royal Highneſs had or ſhould think fit to propoſe in favour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or the buſineſs of the Money, and that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Monſieut Ravigny,</hi> as to the latter, to treat and deal with his Royal Highneſs, and to receive and obſerve his Orders and Directions; but deſired that he might not at all be concerned as to the former, but that his Royal Highneſs would cauſe what Propoſitions he thinks fit to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, to be offered either to Father <hi>Ferrier,</hi> or to <hi>Monſieur Pompone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Letters came to us about the middle of our <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> and his Royal Highneſs expected daily when <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Ravigny</hi> ſhould ſpeak to him about the ſubject of that Letter, but he took no notice at all of any thing, till <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 19, the Evening before the King and the Duke went to <hi>Nevvmarket,</hi> for a fortnight, and then only ſaid, That he had command from his Majeſty to give his Royal Highneſs the moſt firm aſſurance imaginable of his Friendſhip, or ſomething to that purpoſe, making his royal Highneſs a general Complement, but made no mention of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Orders relating to the ſubject of Father <hi>Ferriers</hi> Letter.</p>
            <p>The Duke wondring at this proceeding, and being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſtay good part of <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Nevv-market,</hi> and ſoon after his coming back hearing of the death of Father <hi>Ferrier,</hi> he gave over all further proſecuting of the former Project.</p>

But I believe I ſaw <hi>Monſure Ravigny</hi>'s pollicy all along, who was willing to ſave his Maſters money, upon an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we would do all we could, to ſtave off the Parliament for our own ſakes, that we would ſtruggle as hard without money as with it, and we having by this time upon our own Intereſts prevailed to get the Parliament <hi>Prorogued</hi> till the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> he thought that the <hi>Prorogation</hi> being to a day ſo high in the Spring, would put the Confederates ſo much beyond their meaſures, as that it might procure a Peace, and be as uſeful to <hi>France</hi> as a Deſolution.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Reaſons, which I ſuppoſe he went upon. I had ſeveral diſcourſes with him, and did open my ſelf ſo far to him as to ſay that I could wiſh his Maſter would give us leave to offer 300000 <hi>l.</hi> to our Maſter for the deſolution of the Parliament, and ſhew him that a Peace would moſt certainly follow a deſſolution, which he agreed with me in, and that we deſired not the Money from his Maſter to excite our Wills, or to make us more induſtrious to uſe our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt power to procure a Diſſolution, but to ſtrengthen our Power and Credit with the King, and to render us more capable to ſucceed with his Majeſty, as moſt certainly we ſhould have done had we been fortified with ſuch an Argument.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe I promiſed <hi>Monſieur Pompone,</hi> frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Sir <hi>William Frogmorton,</hi> who returned from hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into <hi>France,</hi> on the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the day our Parliament ſhould have ſet, but was <hi>Prorogueth, Monſieur, Pompone,</hi> as I was informed by Sir <hi>William,</hi> did ſeem to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the thing, but yet had two Objections againſt it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Sum vve propoſed vvas great, and could very ill be ſpared by his Majeſty in the Circumſtances he vvas in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which we anſwered; That if by his expending that ſum he could procure a Diſſolution of our Parliament, and thereby a Peace, which every body agreed would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would ſave five
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62696:6"/>
or ten times a greater ſum, and ſo be a good husband by his expence; and if we did not procure a Diſſolution, he ſhould not be at that expence at all, for that we deſired him only to promiſe upon that condition, which we were contented to be obliged to perform firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond <hi>Objection</hi> was, <hi>That the Duke did not move it, nor appear in it himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which we anſwered, That he did not indeed to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Pompone,</hi> becauſe he had found ſo ill an effect of the Negotiation with Father <hi>Ferrier,</hi> when it came into <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Ravignys</hi> hands, but he had concernd himſelf in it to Father <hi>Ferrier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I continued to proſecute and preſs the Diſſolution of the Parliament, deteſting all <hi>Prorogations,</hi> as only ſo much loſs of time, and a means of ſtrengthening all thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon it in oppoſition to the <hi>Crovvn.</hi> The Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> in the opinion they had taken, that our King durſt not part with his Parliament, apprehending another would be much worſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he could not live without a Parliament, therefore they muſt ſuddainly meet, and the longer he kept them off, the greater the neceſſities would grow, and conſequently their power to compel him to do what they liſted would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe accordingly; and therefore if they could but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves a while, their day would certainly come in a ſhort time, in which they ſhould be able to work their Wills.</p>
            <p>Such diſcourſes as theſe kept the Confederates and our Male-contents in heart, and made them weather on the War in ſpite of all our Prorogations, and therefore I preſſed, as I have ſaid, a Diſſolution until <hi>February</hi> laſt, when our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were ſo totally changed, that we were forced to change our Councils too, and be as much for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Sitting, as we were before againſt it. Our Change was this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62696:7"/>
Before that time the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was the only Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in credit, who thought himſelf out of all danger of a Parliament, he having been accuſed before them and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and therefore was zealous for their ſitting, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Reputation with them, and to become a perfect Favourite, he ſet himſelf all he could to proſecute the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion,</hi> and to oppoſe the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſhew his Zeal againſt the firſt, he revived ſome old dormant Orders, for prohibiting the <hi>Roman Gatholicks</hi> to appear before the King, and put them in Execution at his firſt coming into the Office of <hi>Lord Chamberlaine.</hi> And to make ſure work againſt the ſecond, as he thought, prevailed with the King, to give him and the Earl of <hi>Oſſery,</hi> who married two Siſters of <hi>Myn Heere Odyke's,</hi> leave to go over into <hi>Holland</hi> with the ſaid <hi>Heere,</hi> to make a Viſite, as they pretended, to their Relations, but indeed and in truth, to propoſe the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> Eldeſt Daughter to his Royal Highneſs, as a Match for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent, but againſt the good liking of his Royal Highneſs; inſomuch as the Lord <hi>Arlingtons</hi> Creatures were forced to excuſe him with a diſtinction, that the ſaid Lady was not to be lookt upon as the Dukes Daughter, but as the Kings, and a Child of the State, and ſo the Dukes Conſent not to be much conſidered in the diſpoſal of her, but the Intereſt only of State; by this he intended to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf the Darling of the Parliament and Proteſtants, who would look on themſelves as ſecured in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by ſuch an alliance, and deſigned further, by that means to draw us into cloſe Conjunction with <hi>Holand,</hi> and Enemies of <hi>Erance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> ſet forward upon this Errand, <hi>November</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> 1674, and returned not till <hi>January 6,</hi> following. During his abſence, the Lord <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> were the only Miniſters in any conſiderable credit with the King, and who all pretended
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62696:7"/>
to be intirely united to the Duke, declared loudly and with great violence againſt the ſaid Lord, and his actions in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and did hope in his abſence, to have totally ſupplanted him, and routed him out of the Kings favour; and after that they thought they might eaſily enough have dealt with the Parliament, but none of them had Courage enough to ſpeak againſt the Parliament, till they could get rid of him, for fear they ſhould not ſucceed, but that the Parliament ſhould ſit in ſpight of them, and come to hear that they had uſed their endeavours againſt it, which would have been ſo unpardonable a crime with our omnipotent Parliament, that no power would have been able to have ſaved them from puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But they finding, at his return, when they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt him by ſuch means and arts as they had then tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reſolved upon new Councils, which were to out-run him in his own courſe, which accordingly they undertook, and became as fierce Apoſtles, and as zealous for <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> as ever my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; and in purſuance thereof, perſwaded the King to iſſue out thoſe ſevere Orders and Proclamations againſt <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which came out in <hi>February</hi> laſt, by which they did as much as in them lay to extirpate all <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion</hi> out of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Which Counſels were in my opinion ſo deteſtable, being levell'd (as they muſt needs be) ſo directly againſt the Duke by People that he had advanced, and who had profeſſed ſo much duty and ſervice to him, that we were put upon new thoughts how to ſave his Royal Highneſs from the deceits and ſnares of them upon whom formerly we depended, we ſaw well enough that their deſign was to make themſelves as grateful as they could to the Parliament (if they muſt ſit) they thinking nothing to be acceptable to them as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of <hi>Popery;</hi> but yet they were ſo obnoxious to the Parliaments diſpleaſure in general, that they would have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62696:8"/>
been very glad of any expedient to keep it off, though they durſt not engage againſt it openly themſelves, but thought this device of theirs might ſerve to that purpoſe, hoping that the Duke would be ſo alarm'd at their proceedings and by his being left by every body, that he would be much more afraid of the Parliament than ever, and uſe his utmoſt power to prevent its ſitting, which they doubted not but he would endeavour and they were ready enough to work under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with him for their own ſakes, not his, in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but durſt not appear openly; And to encourage the Duke the more to diſſolve the Parliament, their Creatures uſed to ſay up and down, <hi>That theſe vigorous proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Catholicks vvas in favour of the Duke, and to make the Diſſolution of the Parliament more eaſie, vvhich they knevv he coveted, by obviating one great</hi> Objection <hi>vvhich vvas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made againſt it,</hi> which was, <hi>That if the Parliament should be Diſſolved, it vvould be ſaid it vvas done in favour of Popery, vvhich Clamour they prevented by the ſeverity vvhich they had shevvn against it before hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as we ſaw theſe tricks put upon us, we plainly ſaw what men we had to deal with, and what we had to truſt to if we were wholly at their mercy, but yet durſt not ſeem ſo diſſatisfied as we really were, but rather magnified the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance as advice of great cunning and skill.</p>
            <p>All this we did purely to hold them in a belief, that we would endeavour to diſſolve the Parliament, that they might rely upon his Royal Highneſs, for that which we knew they longed for, and were afraid they might do ſome other way, if they diſcover that we were reſolved we would not.</p>
            <p>At length when we ſaw the Seſſions ſecured, we declared we were for the Parliaments meeting, as indeed we were from the moment we ſaw our ſelves uſed by all the Kings Miniſters at ſuch a Rate: That we had reaſon to believe they would ſacrifice <hi>France, Religion,</hi> and his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62696:8"/>
too, to their own intereſts, if occaſion ſerved, and that they were led to believe that that was the only way they had to ſave themſelves at that time; for we ſaw no expedient for to ſtop them in their Carreirs of Perſecution, and thoſe other deſtructive Counſels, but the Parliament, which had ſet it ſelf a long time, to diſlike every thing the Miniſters had done and had appeared violently againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> whilſt the Court ſeemed to favour it; and therefore we were confident that the Miniſters having turned their faces, the Parliament would do ſo too, and ſtill be againſt them, and be as little for <hi>Perſecution</hi> then, as they had been for <hi>Popery</hi> before.</p>
            <p>This I undertook to mannage for the Duke, and for the King of <hi>Frances</hi> Intereſt, and aſſured <hi>Monſieur Ravigny</hi> (which I am ſure he will teſtify if occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerved) That that Seſſions ſhould do neither of them any hurt, for that I was ſure I had power enough to prevent miſchief, tho I durſt not anſwer for any good they ſhould, do, becauſe I had but very few aſſiſtants to carry on the work, and wanted thoſe helps which others had of making Freinds.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſpared no paines nor expence of monys to anituate as many as they could againſt <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> Lord <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> and all the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and ſuch as call themſelves <hi>Old Cavaleers,</hi> who were all then as one man, were not leſs induſtrious againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and had the Purſe at their Girdle too, which is an excellent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to gain Friends with, and all united againſt the <hi>Duke,</hi> as Patron both of <hi>France</hi> and of the <hi>Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To deal with all this force we had no money, but what came from a few private hands, and thoſe ſo mean ones too, that I dare preſume to ſay, that I ſpent more my particular ſelf out of my own Fortune, and upon my ſingle Credit, than the whole body of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England</hi> beſides, which was ſo inconſiderable in compariſon of what our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62696:9"/>
could command, and we verily believe did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow in making their party, that it is not worth mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Yet, notwithſtanding all this, we ſaw that by the help of the <hi>Nou-Conformiſts,</hi> as <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and other Sects who were as much afraid of Perſecution as our ſelves, and of the Enemies of the Miniſters, particularly the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> who by that time had ſuplanted the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> and was grown ſole mannager of affairs himſelf, we ſhould be able to prevent what they deſigned againſt us, and ſo render the Seſſions ineffectual to their ends, though we might not be able to compaſs our own; which were to make ſome brisk ſtep in favour of his Royal Highneſs, to ſhew the King that his Majeſtys affairs in Parliament were not obſtructed by reaſon of any averſion they had to his Royal Highneſſes perſon, or apprehenſion they had of him or his Religion, but from Faction and Ambition in ſome, and from a real Diſſatisfaction in others. That we have not had ſuch fruits and effects of thoſe great ſummes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which have formerly been given as they expected.</p>
            <p>If we could have made then but one ſuch ſtep, the King would certainly have reſtored his Royal Highneſs to all his Commiſſions, upon vvhich he would have been much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ever yet he was in his whole life, or could probably ever have been by any other courſe in the World, than what he had taken, of becoming <hi>Catholick, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we were ſo very near gaining this Point, that I did humbly beg his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> to give me leave to put the Parliament upon making an Addreſs to the King, That his Majeſty would be pleaſed to put the Fleet into the hands of his <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> as the only perſon likely to give a good account of ſo important a Charge as that was to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and ſhewed his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> ſuch reaſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him that we could carry it, that he agreed with me in it, that he believed we could; yet others telling him how
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62696:9"/>
great a damage it would be to him if he ſhould miſs in ſuch an undertaking (which for my part I could not then ſee, nor do I yet) he was prevailed upon not to venture, though he was perſwaded he could carry it.</p>
            <p>I did communicate this deſign of mine to <hi>Monſieur Ravig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> who agreed with me, that it would be the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to his Maſter imaginable to have the Dukes power and credit ſo advanced, as this would certainly do it, if we could compaſs it: I ſhew'd him all the difficulties we were like to meet with, and what helps we ſhould have. But that we ſhould want one very material one, money, to carry on the work as we ought: And therefore, I do confeſs, I did ſhamefully beg his Maſters help, and would willingly have been content to have been in everlaſting diſgrace with all the World, if I had not with the aſſiſtance of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling from him (which perhaps is not the tenth part of what was ſpent on the other ſide) made it evident to the Duke, that he could not have miſſed it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur Ravigny</hi> uſed to tell me, that if he could be ſure of ſucceeding in that deſign, his Maſter would give a very much larger ſum; but that he was not in a condition to throw away money upon uncertainties.</p>
            <p>I anſwered, That nothing of this nature can be ſo infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly ſure, as not to be ſubject to ſome poſſibility of falling, but that I durſt venture to undertake to make it evident, that there was as great an aſſurance of ſucceeding in it, as any Husband-man can have of a Crop in Harveſt, who ſowes his Ground in its ſeaſon; and yet it would be accounted a very imprndent piece of warineſs in any body to ſcruple the venturing ſo much Seed in its proper time, becauſe it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it may be totally loſt, and no benefit of it in harveſt. He that minds the Winds and the Raines at that rate, ſhall neither Sow nor Reap.</p>
            <p>I take our Caſe to be much the ſame now as it was the laſt Seſſion, if we advance the Dukes Intereſt one ſtep forwards,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62696:10"/>
we ſhall put him out of the reach of all Chances for ever; for he makes ſuch a Figure already, that cautious men do not care to act againſt him, or always without him, becauſe they do not ſee he is much overpowered by his Enemies. Yet he is not at ſuch a pitch as to be quite out of danger, or free from oppoſition, but if he could gain any conſiderable new addition of power all would come over to him as the only Center of our Government, and no body could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him further. Then would <hi>Catholicks</hi> be at eaſe, and his <hi>Most Chriſtian Majeſties</hi> Intereſt ſecured with us in <hi>England,</hi> beyond all apprehenſions whatſoever.</p>
            <p>In order to this, we have two great Deſignes to attempt this next Seſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That which we were about before, <hi>viz. To put the Parliament upon making their humble requeſt to the King that the Fleet may be put into his Royal Highneſſes care.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>Secondly, To get an Act for General Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we carry theſe two, or either of them, we ſhall in effect do vvhat vve liſt aftervvards. And truly vve think vve do not undertake theſe great Points very unreaſonably, for that we have good Cards for our Game; Not but that vve expect great oppoſition; and we have reaſon to beg all the aſſiſtance we can poſſibly get; and therefore if his <hi>Most Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> would ſtand by us a little in this Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and help us with ſuch a ſum as 20000 <hi>l</hi> ſterling, which is no great matter to venture upon ſuch an undertaking as this, I would be content to be ſacrificed to the utmoſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of mine Enemies, if I did not ſucceed.</p>
            <p>I have propoſed this ſeveral times to <hi>Monſieur Ravigny,</hi> who ſeems alwayes of my opinion, and has often told me <hi>That he has vvrit to France on this Subject,</hi> and has deſired me to do the like; but I know not whether he will be as zealous in this point as a <hi>Catholick</hi> would be, becauſe our prevailing in theſe things will give the greateſt blow to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62696:10"/>
               <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> here, that ever it received ſince its Birth, which perhaps he would not be very glad to ſee, eſpecially when he believes that there is another way of doing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties buſineſs well enough without it, which is by a Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Parliament, which I know he mightily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon, and concludes, that if that comes to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it will be as much as he need care for, proceeding, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps upon the ſame manner of diſcourſe which we did this time twelve month. But with ſubmiſſion to his better judgement, I do think that our caſe is extreamly much alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what it was then in relation to a Diſſolution, for then the body of our governing Miniſters (all but the Earl of <hi>Arlington)</hi> were intirely united to the Duke, and would have governed his way had they been free from all fears and controule, as they had been if the Parliament had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, but they have ſince that time engaged in quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Councils, and imbarqued themſelves and Intereſts upon other bottoms, having declared themſelves againſt <hi>Popery;</hi> and to diſſolve the Parliament ſimply, and without any other ſtep made, will be to leave them to Govern what way they liſt, which we have reaſon to ſuſpect will be to the prejudice of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Catholicks,</hi> becauſe their late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and Actions have demonſtrated to us, that they take that for the moſt popular way for themſelves, and the likelieſt to keep them in abſolute power, whereas ſhould the Duke get above them, after the trick they have ſhewed him, they are not ſure he will totally forget the uſuage he has had at their hands. Therefore it imports us now to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our Intereſt a little farther, by ſome ſuch project as I have named, before we Diſſolve the Parliament, or elſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we ſhall but change Maſters, a Parliament for Miniſters, and continue ſtill in the ſame ſlavery and bondage as before, but one ſuch ſtep as I have propoſed well made, we may ſafely ſee them Diſſolved, and not fear the Miniſters, but ſhall be eſtabliſhed and ſtand firm without any oppoſition.

            <p>THE Letter which you gave your ſelf the trouble to vvrit to me, came to my hands but the last night. I received it vvith great ſatisfaction, and I aſſure you that its length did not make it ſeem tedious; I shall be glad on my part, to aſsist in ſeconding your good Intentions, I will conſider of the means to effect it, and vvhen I am better informed than I am as yet I vvill give you an account, to that end I may hold Intelligence vvith you, as you did vvith my Predeceſſour. Sir, I deſire you to believe that I vvill never fail as to good vvill, for the ſervice of your Maſter, vvhom I honour as much as he deſerves, and that it is vvith great truth that I am,</p>

            <head>THE SECOND LETTER OF M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Coleman's To the <hi>French</hi> Kings Confeſſor, <hi>MONSIEUR L' CHAISE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Sent your Reverence a tedious Letter on our <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> to inform you of the progreſs of our Affaires for theſe two or three laſt years. I have now again the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a very ſure hand to conveigh this by, I have ſent you a <hi>Cypher,</hi> becauſe our Parliament now drawing on, I may poſſibly have occaſion to ſend, you ſomething which <hi>You may be vvilling enough to knovv, and may be neceſſary for us that you should,</hi> when I may want the conveniency of a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger. When any thing occurs of more concern than other, which may not be fit to be truſted to a <hi>Cypher</hi> alone, I will, to make ſuch a thing more ſecure, write in <hi>Lemon,</hi> between the Lines of a Letter which ſhall have nothing in it viſible, but what I care not who ſees, but dried by a warm fire ſhall diſcover what is written, ſo that if the Letter comes to your hands, and upon drying it any thing appears more than did before, you may be ſure no body has ſeen it by the way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62696:12"/>
I will not trouble you with that way of writing but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpecial occaſions, and then I will give you a hint to direct you to look for it, by concluding my viſible Letter with ſomething of <hi>Fire</hi> or <hi>Burning,</hi> by which mark you may pleaſe to know that there is ſomething underneath, and how my Letter is to be uſed to find it out.</p>
            <p>We have here a mighty work upon our hands, no leſs than <hi>The Converſion of three Kingdoms, and by that perhaps the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing a peſtilent Hereſy, vvhich has domineer'd over part of this Northern World a long time.</hi> There was never ſuch hopes of Succeſs ſince the Death of our <hi>Q. MARY,</hi> as now in our dayes, when God has given us a <hi>PRINCE</hi> who is become (may I ſay by Miracle) <hi>Zealous of being the Author and Inſtrument of ſo glorious a Work:</hi> But the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition we are ſure to meet with, is alſo like to be great: So that it imports us to get all the Aid and Aſſiſtance, <hi>For the Harveſt is great and the Labourers are fevv.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which we rely upon moſt, next to God Almighties <hi>Providence,</hi> and the Fervor of my <hi>Maſter the Duke,</hi> is the mighty mind of his <hi>Chriſtian Majesty,</hi> whoſe generous Soul inclines him to great undertakings, which being mannaged by your <hi>Reverences</hi> examplary <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make him look upon this, as moſt ſuitable to himſelf, and beſt becoming his power and thoughts; ſo that I hope you will pardon me, if I be troubleſom too upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from whom we expect the greateſt help we can hope for.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I think his <hi>Christian Majesties</hi> temporal intereſt is ſo much attracted to that of his R. H. which can never be conſiderable but upon the advancement of the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> that his Miniſters cannot give him better Advice even in a politick ſence abſtracted from the Conſiderations of the next world, then that of our dear Lord, <hi>To ſeek firſt the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Rightcouſneſs thereof, that all other things may be added.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62696:13"/>
Yet <hi>I</hi> know his moſt <hi>Christian Majeſty</hi> has more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full motives ſuggeſted to him by his own Devotion, and your <hi>Reverences</hi> Zeal for Gods Glory, to engage himſelf to afford us the beſt help he can in our preſent Circumſtances: but we are a little unhappy in this, That we cannot preſs his Majeſties preſent <hi>Miniſter</hi> here, upon theſe latter Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are moſt ſtrong, but only upon the firſt, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Ravigny's</hi> ſence and ours differing very much upon theſe, though we agree perfectly upon the reſt; And indeed though he be a very able man, as to his Majeſties ſervice, in things where Religion is not concern'd, yet <hi>I</hi> do believe it were much more happy, conſidering the Poſt he is in, that his temper vvere of ſuch a ſort that vve might deall clearly vvith him throughout and not be forced to ſtop ſhort in a diſcourſe of conſequence, and leave the moſt material part out, becauſe vve knovv it vvill ſhake his particular opinion, and ſo perhaps meet vvith diſlike, and oppoſition though never ſo neceſſary to the main concern.</p>
            <p>I am afraid we ſhall find too much reaſon for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint this next Seſſions of Parliament, for had we one here for his Chriſtian Majeſty who had taken the whole buſineſs to heart, and who would have repreſented the ſtate of our caſe truly as it is, to his Maſter, <hi>I</hi> do not doubt but his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majſtey would have engaged himſelf farther in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair then at preſent I fear he has done, and by his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation have given ſuch counſells <hi>(as have been offered his</hi> R. H. <hi>by thoſe fevv Catholicks vvho have acceſſe to him and are bent to ſerve him, and advance the Catholick Religion, vvith all their might)</hi> more credit with his R. H. Then <hi>I</hi> fear they have found; And have aſſiſted him alſo with his purſe as far as 100000. Crovvns or ſome ſuch ſumme (vvhich to him is very inconſiderable but vvould have been to them of greater uſe then can be imagined) tovvards gaining o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to help him, or at leaſt not to oppoſe him, if vve had been ſo happy as to have had his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62696:13"/>
vvith us to this degree, <hi>I vvould have anſvvered vvith my life for ſuch ſucceſs this Seſſions, as vvould have put the intereſt of the Catholic. Religion in his</hi> R. H. <hi>And his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty out of all danger for the time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But vvanting thoſe hopes of recommending thoſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, councells vvhich have been given his Royall Highneſs in ſuch a manner as to make him think them vvorthy of his accepting, and fit to govern himſelf by, and of thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, vvhich a little money vvell managed vvould certainly have gained us, <hi>I</hi> am affraid vve ſhall not be much better at the end of this Seſſion then vve are novv: <hi>I</hi> pray God vve do not looſe ground. By my next, vvhich ſhall be ere long, <hi>I</hi> ſhall be able to tell your Reverence more perticularly vvhat vve are like to expect: In the mean time <hi>I</hi> moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg your holy prayers for all our undertakings, and that you vvill pleaſe to honour me ſo far as to eſteem me, vvhich <hi>I</hi> am, entirely and vvithout any reſerve</p>

            <head>A Coppy of his <hi>R. H.</hi> his Letter to <hi>L' Chaiſe,</hi> about the time Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> vvrote his long Letter, 1675.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> laſt paſt, his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty; offered me moſt generouſly his Friendſhip, and the uſe of his Purſe to aſſiſtance againſt the deſignes of my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and his, and proteſted unto me, That his Intereſt and mine were ſo clearly linckt together, that thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the one, ſhould be lookt upon as Enemies to the other; and told me moreover his opinion of my Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament;</hi> which is, <hi>That he is of opinion that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other is in his Intereſt or mine;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he deſired me to make ſuch Propoſitions as I ſhould think fit in this Conjuncture.</p>
            <p>All was tranſacted by the means of Father <hi>Ferrier;</hi> who made uſe of Sir <hi>William Frogmorton,</hi> who is an honeſt man and of truth, who was then at <hi>Paris,</hi> and hath held corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with <hi>Coleman,</hi> one of my Family, in whom I have great confidence.</p>
            <p>I was much ſatisfyed to ſee his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of my opinion, ſo I made him Anſwer the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> by the ſame meanes he had made uſe of to write to me, that is, by <hi>Coleman,</hi> who adreſt himſelf to Father <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> (by the forementioned Knight) and entirely agreed to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, as well to what had reſpect to the Union of our Intereſts, as the unuſefulneſs of my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> in order to the ſervice of the King my Brother, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and that it was neceſſary, to make uſe of our joynt and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt credits to prevent the ſucceſs of thoſe evil deſigns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on by the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> againſt his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and my ſelf; which of my ſide
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62696:14"/>
I promiſe really to perform; of which, ſince that time, I have given reaſonable good proof.</p>
            <p>Moreover I made ſome Propoſals, which I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to bring to paſs, what we were obliged to undertake, aſſuring him that nothing could ſo firmly eſtabliſh our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with the King my Brother, as that very ſame offer of the help of his Purſe, by which means, I had much reaſon to hope I ſhould be enabled to perſwade to the Diſſolving of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and to make void the deſigns of my Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> who works inceſſantly to advance the Intereſt of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and to leſſen that of the King your Maſter, notwithſtanding all the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he hath made to this hour, to render him ſervice.</p>
            <p>But as that which was propoſed was at a ſtand by reaſon of the ſickneſs of Father <hi>Ferrier,</hi> ſo our Affaires ſucceeded not according to our Deſignes, only Father <hi>Ferrier vvrote to me,</hi> the <hi>15th.</hi> of the laſt Moneth, <hi>That he had communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe Propoſitions to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and that they had been very vvell lik't of, but as they contained things that had regard to the</hi> Catholick Religion <hi>and to the offer and uſe of his Purſe, he gave me to underſtand he did not deſire I should treat vvith</hi> Monſieur Ravigny <hi>upon the firſt, but as to the laſt,</hi> and had the ſame time acquainted me, that <hi>Monſieur Ravigny, had order to grant me, vvhatſoever the conjuncture of our Affaires did require;</hi> and have expected the effects of it to this very hour, but nothing being done in it, and ſeeing on the other hand that my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers endeavoured by a thouſand deceits to break the good Intelligence which is between the King my Brother, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and my Self, to the end they might deceive us all three, I have thought fit to advertiſe you of all that is paſt, and deſire of you your aſſiſtance and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to prevent the Roguerys of thoſe who have no other deſign than to betray the Concerns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi>
