         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is, Sir, to Your Loyal Commons an Unſpeakable Grief, That Your Majeſty ſhould be Adviſed to propoſe any thing in Your Meſſage, to which they cannot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with due Regard to that Conſtitution Your Majeſty came over to Reſtore, and have ſo often Expos'd Your Royal Perſon to Preſerve; and did in Your Gracious Declaration Promiſe, That all thoſe Foreign Forces which came over with You, ſhould be ſent back.</p>
            <p>In Duty therefore to Your Majeſty, and to diſcharge the Truſt repoſed in us, we crave Leave to lay before You, That nothing conduceth more to the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Welfare of this Kingdom, than an Intire Confidence between Your Majeſty and Your People: which can no way be ſo firmly Eſtabliſhed, as by Intruſting Your Sacred Perſon with Your own Subjects, who have ſo eminently Signaliz'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on all Occaſions, during the late Long and Expenſive War.</p>

            <p>I have a full Confidence in the Affections of My People, and I am Well aſſur'd they have the ſame in Me, and I will Never give them Juſt Cauſe to alter this Opinion.</p>
            <p>As to My Subjects who Serv'd during the War, I am an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of their Bravery, and of their Zeal for My Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and I have not been wanting to expreſs My Senſe of This to My Parliaments, as well as upon other Occaſions.</p>
            <p>I have all the Reaſon to Truſt and Rely upon them that a Prince can have, and I am ſatisfied, there is not One Man among them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of entertaining a Thought, that what was propos'd in My Meſſage, proceeded from any Diſtruſt of them.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be My Study to the Utmoſt of My Power to Perform the Part of a Juſt and Good King, and as I will ever be Strictly and Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Careful of Obſerving My Promiſes to My Subjects, ſo I will not doubt of their Tender Regards to Me.</p>
