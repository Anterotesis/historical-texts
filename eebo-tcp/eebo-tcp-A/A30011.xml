            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas there is two Papers procured from Friends in <hi>Maryland,</hi> on purpoſe to defame me, I think fit to give a true relation of the whole matter, and leave it to the Conſideration of all Impartial Friends of Truth: The matter then is this, as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About twelve Years ago <hi>John <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ary</hi> and his Wife came to <hi>Burlington,</hi> and ſhew a Letter from G. F. directed to him and three other Friends, in which they were adviſed by G. F. to vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it Friends in <hi>Weſt Jarſey,</hi> and Friends not knowing of the differences betwixt them and Friends in <hi>Maryland,</hi> they were kindly received, and her Teſtimony owned. When they went back <hi>Robert Stacy</hi> and my ſelf took the opportunity of going in their Boat to the Meeting at <hi>Weſt-River,</hi> where ſome of <hi>Rob. Stacy</hi>'s old Acquaintance came to viſit us, and much frequented our company, <hi>viz. John Lynam</hi> and his Wife, <hi>Edw. Serſon,</hi> and others, all of them being ſtrangers to me. Now I found Friends to carry it very ſtraitly to us, but not one of them did in the leaſt inform me the reaſon of their ſtrait carriage all the time of the Meeting, or that <hi>John Lynam</hi> and his Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were out of unity with Friends, but obſerved that they were ſuffered to ſpeak in their Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and what information I had of the matter it was from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101145:2"/>
ſome of the above-ſaid Perſons that much frequented our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and who no doubt would make the beſt of their own Cauſe, which I had not favoured, had Friends diſcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ged their duty to me, by giving me an account of their being out of Unity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for when I came to have a right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nformation concerning them, I writ to Friends my ſence thereof, and did alſo write a Letter to <hi>John Lynam, &amp;c.</hi> advi-ſing them to be reconciled to their Brethen; and the next time that I was at the Meeting at <hi>Weſt-River,</hi> which was about two years ago, where I publickly declared againſt that Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Spirit in <hi>J. L.</hi> and his Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> declaring it (as they ſay in their Paper) to be a killing Spirit, which I ſtill own, believing that <hi>J. L.</hi> and the reſt, (having ſo many years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that contentious Spirit) had loſt their condition, and were thereby become very unfit to preach ſo frequently as they now do. But it is very ſtrange that Copies ſhould be given out of the Meeting-Book, to let People know the hurt they ſay I received by a few days accompanying with the ſaid Perſons, when at the ſame time they own their Miniſtry, and <hi>John Lynam</hi> is one of the 28 Judges againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> and his Friends, altho' a ſtranger to the Differences. But the reaſon of the reviving of theſe old matters is to inſinuate into People that I having once been miſtaken, ſo as to favour ſuch bad Spirits as <hi>John Lynam</hi> and the reſt, I might alſo be miſtaken in my Friend <hi>G. Keith.</hi> To which I ſay, That it was not ſuddainly that I joyned with G.K. but after diligent ſearch and enquiry into the matter, and earneſt Supplication to the Lord, that he would guide me aright, I was drawn forth to joyn with <hi>G. K.</hi> in his Chriſtian Teſtimony, and witneſs Peace and Satisfaction from the Lord therein. And notwithſtanding the 28 Judges ſay, that <hi>G. K. is fallen from the High Places of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>as a man ſlain in his High Places, and become Treacherous to the Spouſe of his Youth, &amp; as a man without the fear of God before his Eyes; G. K.</hi> is a living man, and it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101145:2"/>
is the Glory of God, Proſperity of Truth, and Salvation of Souls that he travails for; and theſe things are Slanders and Lyes writ on purpoſe, by prejudiced men againſt him, to ſlay him in his Reputation, and leſſen Peoples Love to him and his powerful Goſpel Miniſtry, and to hide their own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Error &amp; Unbelief in thoſe Fundamental Principles of Chriſtian Doctrine, which are the Foundation Cauſe of the preſent Difference and Seperation.</p>
            <p>The other Paper, which they alſo recommend to Friends, (ſigned by <hi>Henry Hoſier, John Frue</hi> and <hi>Charles Hollesworth</hi>) ſaith, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding that</hi> Thomas Budd <hi>is one with</hi> George Keith, <hi>owning his Principles, which for ſome Years paſt he by his own mouth declared &amp; cautioned ſeveral to beware of, ſaying, there were dangerous Doctrines that would break forth among us before long by</hi> George Keith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi>; I do freely acknowledge that I am one with G. K. in his preſent Chriſtian Teſtimony, and own his ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Principles; but that he doth hold any dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, or that dangerous Doctrines are broken forth amongſt us who are joyned with <hi>G. K.</hi> remains for them to tell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; if they had known of any dangerous Doctrines among us, it had been more Chriſtian in them to have writ to us and told wherein we were in an Error, than to have ſent Papers privately abroad, inſinuating as if there were dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines broken forth among us; by which it appears, they are either ignorant of the Doctrines &amp; Principles we own, or unbelievers therein, and for their better In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that dangerous Doctrines are held by them that we meet apart from, will eaſily appear by a few things mentioned, that are well known to be true, <hi>viz. The Fitzwater</hi> ſaid to me, in the preſence of divers Witneſſs, <hi>That
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101145:3"/>
he did not own any Man Chriſt Jeſus as Mediator in H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Act of their Monthly Meeting may witneſs what dangerous Doctrines they hold, <hi>viz. That the Light is ſufficient to Salvation without any thing elſe, viz.</hi> without the <hi>Man Christ Jeſus,</hi> and without the Faith of his <hi>Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention</hi> and <hi>Mediation,</hi> which is that ſomething elſe we hold to be neceſſary to make a man a true Chriſtian, as well as to believe in the Light within.</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay, <hi>That I ſaid after a myſterious manner, That a Star would fall, cautioning all to beware of the Times that were coming.</hi> In anſwer, I ſay, that ſeveral Stars are fallen, and many apoſtatized from the Faith, witneſs <hi>W. Stockdale,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>That to preach Faith in Chriſt within, and in Chriſt without was to preach two Chriſt</hi>; and <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> put G. K. to prove by Scripture, <hi>that we were to believe in Chriſt within and in Chriſt without.</hi> And in oppoſition to <hi>G. K's</hi> affirming the neceſſity of the Faith of Chriſt without, as well as in <hi>Chriſt</hi> within, <hi>Tho Lloyd</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt within did all</hi> and argued ſome hours, <hi>That we might be Chriſtians good enough without all Faith of Chriſt as he dyed for our ſins, roſe again, &amp;c R.
