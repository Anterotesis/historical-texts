         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Could it elſe otherwiſe be, that ſo many in this ſo cleare light of Gods Goſpel, ſhould fall away? What haue our aduerſaries now more to pleade for their cauſe, then heretofore they haue had? What can they now ſay, which is not alreadie

fully anſwered by our learned men? They put out indeed new bookes, new in regard of the writing and printing; but the reaſons one and the ſame in older written and printed bookes: this is in ſhew a putting of more ſtrength, to vphold their rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous building, but not in ſubſtance: yet thus they beguile the ſimple and vnſtable-minded. By many waies they ſeeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and beguile people, but eſpecially by accuſing our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of falſhood and nouelty, and affirming theirs to bee the true and moſt ancient faith: in both which they ſpeake very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely. For touching this their preſent Religion (as it differeth from ours, and as it is Popery) it is but a new vpſtart Religion, a patcherie of Iudaiſme, Paganiſme and Hereſie; a Religion deuiſed by men, and not hauing God for the Author: How farre our Religion is from falſhood and noueltie, I haue here indeuoured to ſhew, anſwering to that queſtion ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, Where it was before <hi>Luthers</hi> time?</p>
            <p>If any of our aduerſaries, or all of them together, dare to goe plainely to worke, (for hitherto they haue not) and firſt ſet downe ours and their accord, wherein, and how farre we and they in euery thing doe agree, to cut off hereby all needleſſe ſtrife and contentions. Secondly, then truely and faithfully without equiuocall termes, to deliuer their diſtinct differences from vs, that ſo euery one may rightly diſcerne, whereabout we do contend, and what indeede their now preſent Religion is, which we call Popery, bing ſeuered from our common agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thirdly, to bring theſe their differences to the due triall of Scriptures, the common principles of Chriſtianitie, and the true writings of the ancient Fathers in the firſt Ages; then will it clearely appeare to euery one of indifferent iudgement, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ours or theirs be the true Religion, and whether ours or theirs be the falſe Church.</p>
            <p>In the meane ſpace, till they proceede thus vprightly and ſincerely, I hope, <hi>no Proteſtant in earneſt,</hi> will be inſnared

and catched by their deceites. Let ſuch as in the plentifull meanes of knowledge wilfully liue in ignorance, or hauing knowledge, liue lewdly, without feare of God, loue of truth, and power of Religion, be the prey for craftie Foxes: for theſe be the fitteſt ſubiects for them to worke vpon; and theſe only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile they with, receiuing a iuſt puniſhment for their contempt of ſauing knowledge, or for their conſcienceleſſe liuing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their knowledge. For there is no man of right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and that makes conſcience of his waies, louing the truth, walking humbly before his God, being acquainted with Gods Word, and praying for Gods direction, that God either will giue ouer, or that can in reaſon ſubmit vnto this falſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Church, if he doe but ſeriouſly conſider of ſuch things, as will worke, if not an abſolute condemnation, yet a moſt iuſt ſuſpition of her to be naught; as firſt, the vilifying of holy Scriptures, locking them vp from the common people, as if Gods Word were infectious. Secondly, her thruſting vpon the people her feigned traditions, all beſides, and many of them againſt Scripture. Thirdly, the abſurd and vnreaſonableneſſe of their Latine Seruice, which the people vnderſtand not. Fourthly, their idolatrous praying to Saints, worſhipping ſtockes and ſtones, and reliques of the dead. Fifthly, their groſſe conceit of Chriſts corporall preſence in the Sacrament. Sixthly, the feigned miracles, and notable coozenages therin, found out here, and in other Countries; the boaſting of them a farre off, but not able to worke the like among vs. Seuenthly, the ſhameleſſe &amp; groſſe belying of our doctrine, and ſlandring the liues of our learned men, as <hi>Luther, Caluin, Beza,</hi> and others. Eighthly, the citing in defence of their Religion, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Authors, ſo knowne to be, and ſo condemned to be by the learned on their owne ſide. Ninthly, the not permitting freely our bookes among them, as wee doe theirs among vs. Tenthly, the tying of the people to the Prieſts lippes, and not
<pb facs="tcp:173372:5"/>
permitting them to trie their doctrine, as we doe. The vniuſt curſes, diſſembling practices, and mercileſſe cruelties vſed to vphold their Religion, ſwearing &amp; for ſwearing, by equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ment all reſeruations, and Popes diſpenſations, maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, and powder-plots, and bloodie perſecutions. Twelfthly, The auoyding of a free generall Councell, to heare and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our differences. Who is he that ſhall conſider of theſe things with iudgement, but will ſuſpect this Romiſh Church to be none of Chriſts Church, if withal he adde hereto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the differences betweene the wiſedome below (by which that ſeate is guided) which is earthly, naturall, ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, &amp; deuiliſh, and the wiſdom from aboue (by which Chriſts Church is guided) which is pure, peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy, and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocriſie, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> writeth?</p>
            <p>I doubt not but that you haue already conſidered of theſe premiſſes, and that you are reſolued, that this is the true. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the good way, wherein you walke, euen the ancient, Catholike and Apoſtolike veritie, grounded vpon Scripture, and the principles of Chriſtianitie, taught by the holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church, and confirmed by the blood of bleſſed Martyrs. My deſire is, that God would continue your loue, with encreaſe of zeale towards the ſame more and more. To this purpoſe are theſe my endeuors, which I preſent vnto you, praying your fauourable acceptance of my good meaning, and hearty wel-wiſhes, and worthie reſpect vnto your ſelues, and to all that wiſh well to Sion, and pray for the peace of Ieruſalem: God let them, and you with yours, to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which loue it.

If hee ſhould further a Religion, contrarie to the Scripture, hee ſhould be contrary to himſelfe, allowing and making good that in mens hearts by inward operation, which he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed by the Scriptures, which are of his diuine inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is euident to all that are read in the Scriptures, that they condemne all Heatheniſh, al Heretical, and Idolatrous Religion; likewiſe, all will-worſhip, all vaine inuentions of men, the ſeruing of God by humane traditions, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and doctrines of men: ſo as if our Religion were any ſuch, Gods Spirit would not grace it, nor ſo knit mens harts vnto it, nor ſo effectually worke by it in mens conſciences, nor ſo perſwade vnto it, as he daily doth by the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>If they ſhall denie, that Gods Spirit doth any ſuch thing, as we ſuppoſe; I would faine know of them, what other ſpirit it poſſibly may be, that doth ſo leade men to eſteeme ſo much the Scriptures, doth excite men to the ſtudie of them, and to make them the onely rule of doctrine, and life, to heare, belieue, reſt and delight in them, and ſo to worſhip God onely, as herein he requireth to be worſhipped, and to reiect whatſoeuer is not warranted by them, in euery neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie point of faith? And that onely vpon this perſwaſion, that the Scriptures are Gods word, that they are endited by his Spirit, and written by his holy Prophets and Apoſtles? If this be not the Spirit of God, which doth thus magnifie the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173372:7"/>
holy Scriptures in the heart of euery ſound Chriſtian, what ſpirit then is it? Certainely it muſt bee either the Spirit of God, or of Man, or of the Deuill. But neither of theſe two latter, therefore the former.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. It is not the ſpirit of man that can, and doth thus worke: for firſt, the ſpirit of man perceiueth not the things of God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.11. 1. Cor. 2.14. Rom. 8.7.</note> till Gods Spirit acquaint him with them. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they be fooliſhneſſe vnto him. Thirdly, his wiſdome is enmitie with God, ſo as Gods wiſdome in diuine myſteries, and mans wiſdome can neuer agree in one.<note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> Fourthly, the ſpirit of man ſauoureth the things of the fleſh, and not of the Spirit of God. Fifthly, his heart is continually euil, till he be regenerate. Sixthly and laſtly, it is euidently knowne by too much miſerable experience, that man loueth not the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Scriptures, he cannot delight in them, hee cannot away to frame his life after them; euery one that hath any ſparke of diuine knowledge, knoweth this to bee true from his owne naturall corruption, both in himſelfe and others alſo. Now can any reaſonable-minded man thinke, that ſuch an auerſe ſpirit as is in man, ſo diſaffecting the holy Scriptures, and the ſtudie thereof, that it can be that Spirit which perſwadeth and draweth men, contrary to it corrupt ſelfe, to embrace that Religion which is grounded vpon the Scriptures, and to preſſe to the obedience thereof? Yea, can it bee mans ſpirit, that worketh loue to ſuch a Religion, which ſo oppoſeth mans corruption, as the worldly wiſe Politician derideth it, the pleaſurable man hateth it, the greedy of gaine cannot abide to bee ruled by it, and the haughtie ſpirit which hunteth after the pride of life, hath it in great contempt? ſo as none in very deed, but onely ſuch as doe denie themſelues, doe forſake the world, and can bee well contented to take vp their croſſe, and follow Chriſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can, or will embrace the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is not the ſpirit of Satan. For although hee will abuſiuely now and then alleage Scripture, yet is he a deadly enemie to the Scriptures: he will not leade to the right vſe of them, nor perſwade men to frame their Religion and life
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173372:7"/>
after them, but rather doth ſuggeſt the cleane contrarie, as the ſtorie of the Scriptures witneſſeth, and our owne temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations tell vs. For, as a <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Origen</hi> vpon Numb.</note> Father ſaith, The Deuill cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to haue any to ſtudie the Scriptures; that is torment and paine aboue all paines to him. He hath euer been a rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer vp of perſecution againſt ſuch, as ſerue God in a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely grounded vpon the Scriptures: as hee was in the Iewes, againſt the Apoſtles, and the beleeuing Gentiles; ſo in Gentiles Infidels, againſt Chriſtians; in the Heretikes againſt the Orthodoxall; in our Antichriſtian Aduerſaries againſt vs; and in all lewde liuers, the children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in whom he beareth rule, and whoſe hearts he ſtirreth vp to doe his will againſt all ſuch, as in a more ſtrict man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner endeuour to frame their liues after Gods Word, though in general together, they profeſſe one God, and haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſame Baptiſme, and doe liue together in the ſame Church. Therefore wee ſee, that it cannot be the ſpirit of Satan, that perſwadeth to our ſo holy a Religion by the Scriptures, vpon which onely it is ſettled, ſeeing he ſo dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hateth ſuch a Religion, and the ſound and zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It is not the ſpirit of man and Satan together, as may appeare, firſt, <hi>in Heretikes,</hi> who are led by Satan, and their owne ſpirit. Theſe being not able to iuſtifie their hereſies by holy Scripture, they fall to weaken the authoritie of the Scriptures, they will not reſt on them, but doe flie the light of them, as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and other ancient Fathers witneſſe of Heretikes in their times, who left the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Tertul. de reſur. Carnis. Epiphaen de Haereſ. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>23, 24 38.</hi> Irae. li. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>23.</hi> Tertul. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.

Secondly, <hi>In all will-worſhippers,</hi> which framing a ſeruice to God out of their owne braines, cannot away to make holy Scriptures their guide, but doe leaue them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as they bee addicted to their owne inuentions, of which, God by his Prophets in Scripture often complaines. Thirdly, <hi>In Heathen Idolaters,</hi> who haue been ſet on worke by the Deuill to burne the Scriptures, as did that wicked
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173372:8"/>
                     <hi>Diocleſian</hi>; alſo here in Brittaine, the Infidell Saxons; and in Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">Ier. 36.</note> that vngodly <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> who burnt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> which <hi>Baruch</hi> writ from his mouth at that time. Fourthly, <hi>In our Aduerſaries now,</hi> who cannot reſt with the Scriptures, nor will admit them, as the only Iudge in controuerſies, nor as the onely Rule of Religion. And the very reaſon is, becauſe they teach and practiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things out of their owne ſpirit, euen the doctrine of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, which the Scripture vtterly condemneth. Their Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted will-worſhippers in their Heremeticall life, and their world of Monkiſh Orders, cannot abide the rule of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; their holy courſe of life ſo much admired and extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (yet onely of ſuch as know not the power of Satan, in the deceiueable wayes of his vnrighteouſneſſe) dares not ſtand to be iudged, ruled, and ſquared after the rule of holy Scriptures: yea, as holy as they pretend to bee, yet neither can they, nor wil they wholly frame their ſeruice and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and life after the Word of life. And therefore we ſee, that it cannot be the ſpirit of Man and Satan, whether apart conſidered or conioyned, that doth perſwade, mooue and further to the embracing of that Religion, which is wholly grounded vpon the Scriptures, as ours is. And therefore not being either of theſe, it followeth, that it muſt needs bee the Spirit of God, that thus perſwadeth men to our Religion by the Scriptures, wherein it is contained.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Our Religion appeareth to be written in, and iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Scriptures, for that in thoſe places it getteth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and thriueth, where they are permitted to be ſtudied, and read of all, and to be taught, as the onely rule of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Scriptures are the very life and ſtrength of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as is ſufficiently knowne by experience to our very Aduerſaries. Now, how could this be, if our Religion were not that, which is taught in the Scriptures? For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is aforeſaid, doth condemne Heretikes &amp; Hereſies, will-worſhip and will-worſhippers, idolatry and idolaters; and is the Sword of the Spirit,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.</note> the breath of Chriſts mouth, that conſumeth the Man of Sinne. If our Religion were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173372:8"/>
hereſie, or wil-worſhip, or idolatrie, or the inuention of that Man of ſin, the Scriptures could not be the life and ſtrength thereof, ſeeing they oppoſe, and vtterly condemne thoſe things.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Our Religion ſtandeth, and is vpheld by ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heauenly meanes onely, as the Scriptures allow and preſcribe, and which we find there to bee the onely meanes, vſed at the firſt planting of Chriſtian Religion by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the Primitiue Church, which were theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. There was then <hi>the preaching of Gods Word.</hi> This meanes was preſcribed by our Sauiour Chriſt, to make Diſciples vnto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. and the ſame obſerued by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.19. So preaching of Gods Word is the meanes, by which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, through Gods bleſſing, is planted in mens hearts. As alſo it was foretold and appointed, that it ſhould bee the meanes to regaine people from vnder Antichriſt, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 10.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. There was <hi>the teaching of the grounds,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In the Popes Bull before the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme of the Councell of Trent.</note> 
                     <hi>and principles of Chriſtianitie,</hi> then called <hi>milke,</hi> now commonly called, <hi>the Catechiſme, Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5 12. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2. This hath greatly furthered our Religion, euen by the teſtimony of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, and is a ſpeciall meanes to informe the minds of the ignorant, in the truth of our Religion, that they may not be deceiued.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Then was <hi>teaching and preaching altogether out of the Scriptures</hi> of the Prophets. The Apoſtles taught the Goſpell onely out of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22 <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.23. the Scriptures they cited, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.16, 17. by them they confuted the Aduerſaries, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.28. So our teaching and preaching is out of the Scriptures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles: by theſe we confirme our doctrine, and by theſe chiefely doe we confute our Aduerſaries.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Then was allowed <hi>the vſe of the holy Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to all ſorts, without reſtraint or exception</hi>; they were free to all of the Laity, both men and women. The Apoſtles
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173372:9"/>
neuer forbade them to any, nor euer reprooued any for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or ſtudying of them, but commended them to all ſorts, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21. and left it written, as a matter worthy prayſe in religious men, the Eunuch, and the Noble Baereans, that they read and ſearched the Scriptures; ſo alſo in godly women for training vp their children here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.11. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.15. Yea, <hi>Peter</hi> (whom our Aduerſaries make their Rocke) in generall tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all Chriſtian beleeuers, that they ſhould do well to take heed thereunto, as to a ſure Word, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. So is there here with vs, the free vſe of the Scriptures; this wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to all ſorts, forbid them to none, but rather hold them moſt religious, who delight in the holy and reuerent ſtudie of the Scriptures, according to the practice of the ancient Primitiue Church in the Apoſtles dayes.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Then were there <hi>publike Aſſemblies,</hi> where they met together, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.46. and that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt day of the weeke, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. Theſe Aſſemblies none might forſake, but all were mutually to exhort to the frequent vſe of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. to beware of cauſing diuiſions and offences, contrary to the receiued doctrine of the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. So haue wee publike Aſſemblies, where wee meete on the firſt day of the weeke, and at other times, which all are bound to come vnto, and none ought to forſake, to preuent diuiſions, contrarie to the Apoſtolicall doctrine, and to preſerue the publike profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and exerciſe of our Religion.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Then was there <hi>ſet ouer euery ſeuerall Aſſembly and Congregation, ſuch as might be able to teach,</hi> hauing the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the people, and care of their ſoules, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2, 3. So is this in our Church a moſt excellent meanes to vphold our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Then was <hi>God onely worſhipped, and he onely prayed vnto in thoſe Aſſemblies</hi>; not Saints, nor Angels, nor the Virgin <hi>Marie.</hi> In them prayers were made with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.42. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.24. the Word read, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:173372:9"/>
5.27. <hi>Col</hi> 4.16. the Word preached, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adminiſtred, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 20, 23, 26. and the Lords Supper in both kinds deliuered, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. Collections were alſo made for the poore, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.12. and al things were performed to edification, in a known tongue, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. In our Aſſemblies God is onely worſhipped, to him onely we make our prayers, and neither to Saint nor Angell, nor to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; though wee honour them duly as we ought. In our Aſſemblies, Prayer is made with one accord, the Word read and preached, the Sacraments adminiſtred, and the Lords Supper in both kinds deliuered, Almes, as need requires, giuen to the poore, and all done to edification, and in a knowne tongue, as in the Apoſtles dayes.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Then was <hi>preached againſt, and forbidden all will-worſhip,</hi> though neuer ſo faire in ſhew, <hi>all ſeruice to God after the doctrine and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of men, Col.</hi> 2.20, 23. alſo, the <hi>worſhip of Angels, Col.</hi> 2.18. <hi>the worſhip of Idols,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.21. <hi>and fellowſhip with Idolaters,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. <hi>and</hi> 5.11. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 18. So with vs are forbidden all theſe things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by our Religion, as is euident by our booke of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, booke of Articles, the publike authorized larger Catechiſme, and other publike Records: yea, the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, aboliſhing, and preaching againſt theſe things, is an excellent meanes to vphold the purity of our Religion, which in it ſelfe is ſo contrary to all will-worſhip, humane inuentions, ſuperſtition and idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Then was the exerciſe of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline</hi> for the preſeruation of order, for the puniſhing and caſting out of obſtinate Heretikes, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. as alſo of notorious offenders, which would not otherwiſe bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14. and thoſe the people were to auoyd, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.7. This godly diſcipline duly obſerued, is of great force to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue our Religion, and to keepe it in honour and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Then was there vrging and preſſing to <hi>a holy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173372:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both in Paſtors, Tit.</hi> 2.7, 8. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. <hi>and in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Rom.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. &amp; 6. This Chriſtian-like conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion adorneth our Religion, which is onely powerfull in them which liue well; for it condemneth all Libertiniſme, and requireth very ſtrict obedience to God and his Word.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Then was <hi>ſuffering of perſecution for the truth,</hi> and the ſame foretold to accompany the godly, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.3. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. which greatly furthered Religion, taught by the Apoſtles, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12. And ſo hath it done ours in theſe parts of Chriſtendome, as the World knoweth.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. Then was taught <hi>ſubiection both of Paſtors and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto Principalities and Powers, as to Kings, ſo to inferiour Magiſtrates ſent by them.</hi> All ſorts without exception, were taught obedience to them, and for conſcience ſake, were they bound to render to them dues, tribute, cuſtome, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. They were commanded to make prayers for them with thankſgiuing, which was a meanes to further Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for the Apoſtle telleth them, that thus to doe is well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a meanes to ſtop the mouthes of the Aduerſaries, that ſo they might leade a quiet and peaceable life in al god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and honeſtie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 7. <hi>Tit</hi> 3.1. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 17. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. This is, &amp; hath bin an excellent meanes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance our Religion: for Kings and Princes ſeeing, that our true and Apoſtolicall Religion did not derogate from their lawfull authoritie, did not draw ſubiects from their allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor exempt any from their true obedience, but rather maintained the right, which God by his holy Word in Scriptures had giuen them; they ſubmitted to the truth, and embraced our Religion, ſhaking off the yoake of Antichriſt, and ſo tooke vpon them the authoritie giuen them of God, to reforme Religion, according as they were taught, and had learned the doctrine of Chriſt in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee ſee, firſt, the ordinarie meanes which the holy Scriptures preſcribe, and euidently ſhew to haue been vſed in the Primitiue Church, for the planting and vpholding of Chriſtian Religion. And ſecondly, that the very ſelfe-ſame
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173372:10"/>
haue been, and yet are the meanes for planting and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of our Religion, in euery Country where it hath been receiued. Which meanes are ſo powerfull and effectuall for this purpoſe, that looke by how much theſe meanes are put in execution, by ſo much doth our Religion proſper, in ſpite of all worldly oppoſitions, and gaine-ſayings whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer: and on the contrarie, looke as theſe meanes, either wholly, or but in part, are neglected, or faile to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo doth our Religion loſe of its ſtrength, and decay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, what policie ſoeuer men otherwiſe vſe to vphold the ſame. For our Religion ſtands by holy and heauenly meanes, and not by meere worldly policie, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane deuices, faire ſhewes to the eyes, delights to the eare, pleaſurable obiects to delight the carnally-minded. Neither can it be held by any Satanicall deluſions, fabulous narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, feigned miracles, deceitfull iugglings; nor by pretended apparitions of Angels, or of ſoules departed; nor by the bare authoritie of mens ſayings, Decrees of corrupt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, Popes ſentences, wrangling Canoniſts, Sophiſticall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions of Schoolemen, humane Traditions, Apocryphall writings, old and idle cuſtomes, examples of ignorant fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, eſtimation of mens perſons for learning, and ſhew of holineſſe; nor by any deceitfull, wicked, and corrupt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as by counterfeite and baſtard writings, corrupting of Councels and Fathers, expunging words and ſentences out of learned mens workes, or altering them from the true meaning, to beguile the ſimple Reader. No, nor by furious and forcible meanes; as by fire and fagot, maſſacres, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, poyſons, and ſtabbing of Kings, and Gun-powder-plots, nor by any ſuch helliſh practices, ſuch as the Apoſtles neuer ſpake of, the Primitiue Church neuer knew of, nor in holy Scripture were euer ſpoken of; for all theſe, our Religion doth vtterly condemne. It is vpheld only by thoſe holy and heauenly meanes, which the Apoſtles taught, and practiſed, and which they haue left written in the Scriptures for direction of Gods Church, that ſhe may know, which be the onely effectuall meanes, that God hath appointed to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173372:11"/>
his true Religion. By theſe meanes onely, ours is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. And therefore it is that true Religion, which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture teacheth. Which being ſo, I conclude this firſt argument, That this our preſent Religion, wherein we differ from our Aduerſaries, was before <hi>Luthers</hi> time.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And therefore this our now preſent Religion was before</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Minor is thus confirmed, both for the writing of it in their hearts, and for ſuffering for it. The latter manifeſteth the former: for they that faithfully and conſtantly obey the truth, euen vnto ſuffering perſecution, and death for it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt haue it written in their hearts. For if Religion be not imprinted in the hearts of the Martyrs, in whoſe hart is it written? For the Martyrs had the Spirit of the liuing God, ſauing-knowledge, and remiſſion of ſinnes: they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in Gods Statutes, and kept his Iudgements ſincerely; all which are the euident ſignes, that Gods truth was written in their hearts, as theſe places of Scripture witneſſe, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33, 34. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.27. This is not to bee doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of. But the queſtion is, Whether all the Martyrs did ſuffer for this our Religion, or no? To anſwere to this, wee muſt conſider, that all the Martyrs of Chriſt may be ranked into foure ſorts, euery of which ſuffered for ſuch truths, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173372:11"/>
are in our Religion, which we doe at this day profeſſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Sort of Martyrs</hi> were thoſe, who ſuffered by the Iewes, whereof the firſt was <hi>Stephen,</hi> then <hi>Iames,</hi> with many more, <hi>Act</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.2, 4. All theſe did ſuffer for that Religion, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught: but they taught out of the Scriptures, and not out of Traditions, as the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and Acts ſhew. But to ſuffer for that Religion, which is onely taught in the Scriptures, is to ſuffer for ours, as by the former argument is prooued. Therefore they ſuffered for our Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Sort of Martyrs</hi> were ſuch, as ſuffered by and amongſt the Heathen, eſpecially vnder the Romane Tyrants, during the ten bloody perſecutions; among which Martyrs were moſt of the Apoſtles: for we reade not in Scripture, that any of the Apoſtles ſuffred martyrdome amongſt the Iewes, but onely <hi>Iames, Iohns</hi> brother, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. the reſt ſuffered among the Heathen. Now the Apoſtles being the planters of our Religion (as by their writings doth appeare) and alſo Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs for the ſame among this ſecond ſort, they muſt needs be our Martyrs, ſuffering for our Religion, and ſo all the reſt which followed the Apoſtles in the ſame faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Sort of Martyrs</hi> were ſuch, as ſuffered by the furie and rage of Heretikes, when the Arians had god an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaying power through Arian Emperours and Kings. But thoſe Orthodoxall Martyrs and Confeſſors ſuffered for no other doctrine, then our Religion teacheth. For wee hold and profeſſe the faith of the Councell of Nice, and <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> Creed; for in our common Prayer-booke they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted publikely to be read in our Aſſemblies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe alſo ſuffered for our Religion, and were our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</p>
                  <p>But heere our Aduerſaries will ſay, that all theſe three ſorts were their Martyrs; for they brag and boaſt of theſe to ſilly people, as if they had ſuffered for their religion, now profeſſed and practiſed among them. But that the truth may appeare, whether theſe Martyrs bee theirs, or ours, wee muſt conſider them both as Martyrs, and alſo as beleeuers:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173372:12"/>
properly they were Martyrs in thoſe things, for which they did ſuffer. Now their ſuffering was for the common truths, receiued both by our Aduerſaries and vs. So the cauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Martyrs, and it equally held of both, they are our Martyrs, aſwell as theirs. Yea, if we conſider them alſo as Beleeuers, holding other points of faith, for which they were not queſtioned, neither ſuffered for, wee may more rightly claime them, then our Aduerſaries. For of which Religion they held, and moſt agreed vnto, of that Religion muſt they be iudged to be. That this may bee knowne, it muſt be wel conceiued, what they and we meane by ſaying, <hi>Our Religion.</hi> We either ſide ſtand vpon our Religion, not as wee agree in points of Chriſtianitie one with the other; but as wee haue our differences alſo to our ſelues one from the other. So vpon this reſteth the point, to trie the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs whoſe they bee, theirs or ours, by their more or leſſe agreeing, or diſagreeing with either ſide in our ſaid diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. But in reſpect of the maine differences of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from ours, that they cannot claime the Martyrs, I thus proue by theſe enſuing reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. If theſe maine, differences in their Religion be ſuch, as none of theſe Martyrs (which ſuffered by, and amongſt the Iewes, or by, and amongſt the Heathen, or by, and amongſt the wicked Heretikes) euer made profeſſion of, much leſſe ſuffered for, then in reſpect of theſe differences, are they not their Martyrs; they cannot appropriate them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as they vſe to doe, but are ſtill Martyrs in common.</p>
                  <p>But the antecedent is true, as ſhall be prooued by my third reaſon next following, for ſixe hundred yeeres ſpace after Chriſt, in which ſpace were all three ſorts of Martyrs. And therefore the conſequence cannot be denied.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. If theſe differences in their Religion bee nothing elſe but humane inuentions, without ſound authoritie from holy Scriptures, and that the Martyrs profeſſed and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thoſe things onely, which expreſſely, or by neceſſarie concluſions, are contained in the Scriptures, then in reſpect of theſe differences, they are not their Martyrs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:173372:12"/>But the former part is true. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the latter muſt needes be granted.</p>
                  <p>For the truth of the antecedent, touching the vnwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe of theſe their differences, and without all ground of Scripture: I demand of Papiſts, what Scripture haue they for theſe things, wherein we and they doe differ?</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Of God.</hi> What Scripture for the picturing of the holy Trinitie; forbidden by <hi>Moſes</hi> to be any way repreſented? <hi>Deut.</hi> 4 15, 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Of the Scriptures.</hi> Where is it written, that the Scriptures receiue authoritie from the Church, and the ſenſe thereof onely ſubiect vnto her? That the Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin tranſlation is only to be admitted as authenticall? That the Scriptures be imperfect, and are not the certaine rule of faith? That there are traditions beſides for perfecting the Scriptures, and to bee receiued with equall authoritie with Scriptures?</p>

That he was to be appointed Vicar of Chriſt? That the Pope is the vniuerſall Biſhop? That he onely is <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour, and Chriſts Vicar? That he cannot erre <hi>è Cathedra?</hi> That he is aboue Councels? That hee may depoſe Kings from their temporall eſtates, and diſpoſe of their Kingdomes? That he can diſpenſe with ſinnes againſt the plaine Law of God? That he can ſet ſoules free out of torments after this life?</p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>Of the Clergie and Eccleſiaſticall perſons.</hi> In what place of Scripture is it taught, that there be Popes, Cardinals, and Popiſh Prelates like Princes? That there are now Prieſts, to whom a ſpeciall Office of Prieſthood is aſſigned? That there bee ſeuen degrees thereof? That a man is now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the time of the Goſpell, to offer ſacrifices daily for the quicke and the dead? That all Churchmen (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)

                  <p n="6">VI. <hi>Of the Sacraments.</hi> Where doth the Scripture teach, that Baptiſme is to bee adminiſtred with Chriſme, Oyle, Coniuring, Salt, Spittle? That there is ſuch a ſpirituall kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred betweene the Witneſſes, and the party baptized, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo betwixt the Parents and Children of thoſe Witneſſes, as it hindreth marriage (without a diſpenſation) betwixt one another, though there be otherwiſe no kindred either of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity or conſanguinity? That Ieſus Chriſt is bodily and wholly, as he is Man, borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the Bread being turned into his Fleſh? That it is a ſacrifice for the quick and the dead? That the Cake is to bee reſerued, and carryed about in pompe, and that all are to fall downe to it, and worſhip it? That it is to bee adminiſtred but in one kind? That the Lay people muſt not take it, but gape and eate it?

                  </p>
                  <p n="11">XI. <hi>Of dayes.</hi> Where doe the Apoſtles teach, that there are ſuch a number of Holy-dayes, as be in that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

                  <p n="12">XII. <hi>Of meates.</hi> Where in Scripture reade they, that there is ſuch a difference of meates, as the obſeruation of ſuch a difference at ſome times, is more holy, then at other ſome times?</p>
                  <p>All theſe differences are humane inuentions, without warrant of Scriptures. Now let them ſhew, that any of theſe ſorts of Martyrs beleeued and profeſſed theſe differences; if they cannot, then the concluſion is good, that they were not their Martyrs by theſe differences, but in common ſtill ours as well as theirs.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. If theſe differences be but a very patchery of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Iudaiſme, and Paganiſme, then in reſpect thereof, they cannot be their Martyrs: for Martyrs ſuffered for none of theſe three, but, in deteſtation thereof, were grieuouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by Iewes, Pagans, and Heretikes.</p>
                  <p>But the anticedent is moſt true, as our learned men haue made it manifeſt. For Hereſies; <note n="a" place="margin">De Eccleſ. pa. <hi>308.</hi>

                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:173372:14"/>IV. If theſe differences from our Religion doe offer violence to the three Offices of Chriſt, and make their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like worſhip in many things blaſphemous, and idolatrous; then in reſpect of ſuch differences, they are not their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</p>
                  <p>But the antecedent is true. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the conſequent.

                  <p n="5">V. If many of theſe differences of theirs be not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Scripture, without warrant from thence, as before is ſhewed, but alſo flat againſt Scripture, and againſt our common tenents, agreed vpon betweene vs and them: then in reſpect of theſe differences, they are not their Martyrs. For they did not ſuffer for thoſe things which were againſt Scripture, and the common tenents of Chriſtianity, wherein we and our Aduerſaries doe agree. If they dare affirme this, let them giue inſtances thereof.</p>
                  <p>But many of theſe their differences are againſt Scripture, and againſt the common tenents of Chriſtianity, in which we both agree.

                  <p>But none of theſe Martyrs were Papiſts, or Romane Catholikes; for they held not theſe many differences of theirs from vs, by which a Papiſt becommeth a Papiſt or Romane Catholike, and without which hee is not by them approoued to be ſuch a one. For let a man hold all other poynts of Chriſtianity wholly and fully; yet if he hold not, that the Pope hath authority, as Chriſts Vicar vpon earth: that the Church of Rome is the Mother and Miſtreſſe of all Churches: that there are ſeuen Sacraments: that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be receiued in one kind: that the bread after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is tranſubſtantiated, and Chriſt there corporally vnder the formes of Bread and Wine, and ſo to bee diuinely adored: that ſeruice is to bee ſaid euery where in Latine: that Images are to bee ſet in Churches, and to bee worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: that Saints departed, are to bee prayed vnto, and their Reliques worſhipped: that there is a Purgatory for penall ſatisfaction after this life: that our workes doe merit, and that we are iuſtified by them before God: that Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perſons may not marry: that confeſſion of ſinnes is to be made ſecretly to a Prieſt in his eare, and that hee hath power iudicially to abſolue the confitents, and impoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance vpon them for ſatisfaction for ſinne vnto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:173372:16"/>Theſe, and ſuch like articles newly coyned, whoſoeuer doth not hold, is not iudged to be a Romane Catholike But none of theſe differences did theſe Martyrs hold, much leſſe euer ſuffered perſecution for. For not one of theſe articles of the Trent Conuenticle was held in the time of theſe ſorts of Martyrs, all of them ſuffering within the 600. yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, in which ſpace was there none that might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Papiſt, or Roman Catholike after the definition of the Trentiſts. And therefore were they not their Martyrs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did any of them profeſſe the now new Romane Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
                  <p>And thus wee ſee, how by theſe differences they cannot claime the Martyrs. Now our differences from them, are all grounded vpon Scriptures, and principles of Chriſtianity, and warranted by ſuch common truth of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they and we doe fully accord in; not one of our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences being either hereſie, or any part of Iudaiſme, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme, nor euer condemned by any generall Councell in the ſpace of theſe firſt ſixe hundreds of yeeres, in which theſe three ſorts of Martyrs did liue. True it is, that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries call vs Heretikes, and lay hereſies to our charge, but falſely,<note place="margin">Lib. de eccleſ. cont. <hi>2.</hi> quaeſt. <hi>5.</hi> pa. <hi>300.</hi> &amp; <hi>308.</hi>

Seeing then our differences and truths of Chriſtian Religion, taught by the Apoſtles, and by the ſucceeding Paſtors, and belieued by the Church, are the parts of that Faith and Religion, which theſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs ſuffered for; I conclude, that in regard both of the truthes, wherein wee and our Aduerſaries agree, and alſo of our differences, wherein we diſagree from the now preſent Church of Rome, they were our Martyrs, and none of theirs.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>Sort of Martyrs</hi> are thoſe, who ſuffered by, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe our aduerſaries, as the Berengarians, Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Albigenſes, <hi>Wicklife</hi> and his followers in England, <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> of Prague, at Conſtance, and many moe in Bohemia, and in other places, euen to <hi>Luthers</hi> time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:173372:16"/>
an innumerable multitude ſlaine and maſſacred, burnt, and put to ſundry deathes for our Religion, and for gaine-ſaying our aduerſaries in thoſe differences, which we now ſtand out in, againſt the Church of Rome at this preſent. Theſe were therefore our Martyrs.</p>
                  <p>But our aduerſaries will ſay, that theſe were no Martyrs,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> but condemned Heretikes.</p>
                  <p>That they were Martyrs, &amp; no Heretikes, its cleare.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> calleth thoſe Saints and Martyrs of Ieſus, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17.6. which ſhould ſuffer for the Word of God, for refuſing to worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing his marke in their fore-heads, or in their hands, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</hi> 20.4. and for keeping the Commandements of God, and the faith of Ieſus, and ſo dying in the Lord, ſhould reſt from their labours, and be accounted bleſſed, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 14.12, 13. But ſuch were theſe our Martyrs, for they ſuffered for Gods Word, for keeping the Commandements and Faith of Ieſus, and for refuſing to worſhip the Beaſt and Whore of Rome; drunke with the blood of the Saints. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were bleſſed Martyrs, and no Heretikes.</p>
                  <p>But they will ſay; Theſe held diuers errours,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> and were not in all things wholly with vs?</p>
                  <p>They ſuffered,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and were Martyrs for thoſe ſelfe-ſame things, which with vs they witneſſed againſt the Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Many errours are aſcribed vnto them,<note place="margin">De continu. &amp; ſtatu Eccleſiae.</note> which they neuer held, as Doctor <hi>Vſher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Meeth</hi> learnedly ſhewes.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Though in ſome things they ſhould haue differed from vs, yet doth not that make them not to be of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For if for lighter differences in opinions, men ſhould be held not to be of the ſame Religion (if ſo our aduerſaries will conclude) then are the now Romaniſts not of one and the ſame Religion, which is now profeſſed at Rome: for one of them differs much from another in many things.<note place="margin">See Doct. <hi>Hall</hi> his peace of Rome.</note> Neither haue they any right to the ancient Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene whom and theſe our aduerſaries, is alſo great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173372:17"/>
and that in many things. Theſe Martyrs therefore, though they might differ from vs in ſome things (the Light then not ſhining ſo clearely, as now it doth) were our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. Thus wee ſee all the Martyrs from the beginning, to be ours, and ſo haue our Aduerſaries none at all, which may be properly called theirs, for the firſt 600. yeeres: For if they claime the firſt three ſorts, its but as they doe agree with vs; for in their differences from vs, the Martyrs are none of theirs. The fourth ſort are clearely our owne, and are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in defence of our differences from them. But for their differences, they haue no Mrrtyrs of Ieſus: for ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs as be his Martyrs, ſuffer for his ſake, for Gods Word, for his Faith and Commandements: but their differences are not Gods Word, nor the Faith, nor Commandements of Ieſus, neither ſuffered Papiſts here for Religion; but for treaſon, rebellion, diſloyall acts, for denying due obedience to lawfull authority, and for ſtanding in defence of forraine power, and the authority of the Whore of Babylon, the murtherer of Saints, and of that Antichriſt the Pope, as hee is prooued ſufficiently ſo to bee. And therefore I conclude, our Religion to be before <hi>Luthers</hi> time.</p>

                  <p n="2">II. There is that which is called, <hi>The Apoſtles Creed,</hi> and the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> which they profeſſe, the Articles whereof we hold, and therein is contained the ſumme of our Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. There is <hi>the Lords Prayer,</hi> the paterne of all true Prayers, according to which onely we teach how to pray aright, and thereafter doe frame our prayers.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV.

                  <p n="5">V. They acknowledge <hi>the two Sacraments, Baptiſme and the Lords Supper,</hi> both which we doe adminiſter.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. There are <hi>common tenents of Chriſtianitie,</hi> which all Chriſtian Churches haue euer held, wherein we &amp; they doe fully agree.</p>

                  <p n="2">II. That ſame Religion firſt taught, did continue here in ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles dayes, and was held at <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> comming,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="3">III. Here were many which ſuffered Martyrdome in <hi>Diocleſians</hi> reigne, before <hi>Auſtines</hi> dayes, but it is prooued before in the ſecond Argument, that all the Martyrs of Chriſt were of our Religion. And therefore was that our

                  <p n="7">VII. The Religion which we profeſſe, is the ſame which was at Rome, at the time of the three conuerſions of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as they call them; and therefore was this our Religion before <hi>Auſtines</hi> comming, and here profeſſed when hee came in.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt conuerſion</hi> was in the Apoſtles dayes; but in their daies, was our religion at Rome, as Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle written to the Saints there, and other of his Epiſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare; as alſo the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (whom they would faine haue to haue been at Rome) to which our Religion agreeth wholy and fully, wherein ſoeuer wee now differ
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173372:21"/>
from the preſent doctrine of the Church of Rome. Let their writings be Iudge,<note place="margin">See <hi>Catol.

And therefore was it our Religion then profeſſed at Rome, and not this new Romiſh Faith.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond Conuerſion</hi> they make to bee in <hi>Eleutherius</hi> dayes, who wrote, as they acknowledge, vnto our King here, called <hi>Lucius.</hi> If here was any conuerſion wrought, it was to our Religion, and not to the preſent Romiſh Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as may be clearely gathered out of that Epiſtle of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leutherius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <p>See the Epiſt. in the booke of the Lawes of the Saxon Kings, in the Saxons lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>

                     </note> and which they doe approue of, as written to the ſame <hi>Lucius.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Eleutherius</hi> there telleth the King, that he had receiued the Law and Faith of Chriſt. Secondly, (as hereby ſhewing him where this Law and Faith was to bee found) he telleth him againe immediatly vpon theſe former words, that he had receiued both the parts of the ſcriptures. Thirdly, he ſo commendeth the Scriptures to the King and his Councell, that thence, by Gods grace, they themſelues might take a Law to rule the Kingdome. This Biſhop did not take vpon him to preſcribe them Lawes, hee alloweth them (being Lay perſons, as they now ſpeake) to meddle with the holy Scriptures, and from thence (and not from him, nor from his Lawes, nor from the Lawes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes) to take a Law to liue by. This Biſhop therefore held the Scripture ſufficient for a direction and guide to a whole Kingdome; hee held them not ſo obſcure, but that the King and his Councell (by Gods grace) though but young Chriſtians, might learne out of them the wil of God, how hee would haue a Chriſtian Kingdome gouerned. Fourthly, this godly Biſhop calleth <hi>Lucius</hi> Gods Vicar in his owne Kingdome, and alleageth Scripture to prooue it; hee was not then ſwolne vp with the pride of Antichriſtian Supremacy, nor conceited any temporall power ouer kings, as now the Popes doe. Laſtly, hee puts wholly the care of the people vpon the King, as a Father to looke to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to call them to the Faith and Law of Chriſt, and to the holy Church, hereby acknowledging the King to bee the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173372:21"/>
ſupreme Head and Gouernour in all cauſes, aſwell Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, as Ciuill, and to be Gods Vicar in his owne Realme; which title that Biſhop twice nameth in that Epiſtle. Thus we ſee out of this ſhort Epiſtle, what we may thinke of the Religion then at Rome, and how agreeing to ours now, and differing from theirs at this preſent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third conuerſion</hi> (for which they magnifie ſo much this <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but very falſely) was in <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Great his dayes. In which time, though many corruptions were crept into the Church of Rome: yet the maine points of our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, wherein we differ from this preſent Romiſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, were then taught in that Church, as may appeare out of the writings of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> as he did then teach, concerning <hi>holy Scriptures, the grace of God, of Freewill, of the Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See for all theſe in <hi>Cat. Teſt. verit. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 558.</note> 
                     <hi>of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, of Faith, of good Workes,</hi> alſo concerning the <hi>not worſhipping of Images,</hi> likewiſe of the acknowledging <hi>of the two Sacraments,</hi> alſo his iudgement <hi>of the Church, of the head of the Church, of Antichriſt, of an vniuerſall Biſhop, of ſecular power ouer Biſhops, of Marriage, of ſoules departed, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they went. Gregorie</hi> was no Patrone of the <hi>Romiſh Maſſe,</hi> nor of the <hi>corporall and tranſubſtantiated bread,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See for theſe Biſh. <hi>Mortons</hi> Catho. Appeal. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.3.4.4.</note> nor of <hi>merit,</hi> nor of <hi>Papall ſupremacy,</hi> nor of <hi>temporall iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer Kings and Emperours,</hi> nor of <hi>the neceſſitie of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies alike in euery Church. Gregorie</hi> held <hi>not the Machabees canonicall,</hi> but taught the <hi>perfection of Canonicall Scripture</hi>; he exhorted <hi>Lay men to the ſtudie of them,</hi> and in his time the <hi>Scriptures were allowed, and prayers were ſaid in a knowne and vulgar tongue:</hi> he held the <hi>Catholike Church to be the elect,</hi> and the reprobate out of it, and was <hi>againſt marriages within degrees forbidden, Leuit.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee that at the three conuerſions, our Religion now, and that at Rome then, was one and the ſame. Neither can our aduerſaries ſhew the contrary from <hi>Scripture,</hi> from the <hi>vniforme conſent of ancient Fathers,</hi> either Greeke or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, or from <hi>generall Councels</hi> within thoſe times, no nor from <hi>the Biſhops of Rome themſelues,</hi> for that ſpace; if they will make conſcience to deale ſquarely, plainly and honeſtly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173372:22"/>
in their proofes. And that they may ſo doe, I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate to lay aſide, firſt, all <hi>counterfeite Decretall Epiſtles</hi> ſuch as thoſe be,<note place="margin">Doct. <hi>Feild</hi> of the Church, <hi>b.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 34 <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol.

Fifthly, the <hi>places corrupted</hi> in any of their writings. If they will caſt off this great and wicked deceite, in allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging theſe for themſelues, the truth of my aſſertion, <hi>That this our Religion was then at Rome, and not this their preſent Romiſh faith,</hi> will manifeſtly appeare to all men not wilfully blinded, for by and worldly reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Chriſtian Religion firſt planted in Ireland, was before <hi>Auſtins</hi> comming in hither. For, as is afore ſpoken, Scottiſh and Iriſh Chriſtian Biſhops withſtood him at his comming. But that which was then receiued, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ancient Iriſh, was for ſubſtance the very ſame, which is now here in England by publike authoritie main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as is ſubſtantially proued by a godly learned Father in all Antiquities of the Church,<note place="margin">See his Epiſtle before named.</note> the <hi>Lord Biſhop of Meeth</hi>; to which I referre euery Reader, which deſireth to bee ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in theirs, and our agreement about <hi>Scripture tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, predeſtination, freewill, the Law, ſinne, free remiſſion of ſins, iuſtification by faith onely, imperfection of ſanctification, merit, purgatory, and ſoules departed, about Gods worſhip, Images, the Maſſe, communicating in both kinds, and the myſticall recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacrament.</hi> That Learned man doth ſhew, how wee and they doe agree in all theſe things, which are the moſt maine points of faith betwixt our aduerſaties and vs.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I conclude from this, and all that formerly hath been produced in this fifth Argument, that this our preſent Religion was heere in this Iland before <hi>Auſtines</hi> time.</p>

                     <hi>But our Religion is of God, which I thus prooue:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was taught by the Prophets and Apoſtles, meſſengers of God: the Prophets were ſent by him, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 17.13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 25.4. by whom God ſpake, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. and they taught and wrote, as the holy Ghoſt directed them, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.25. The Apoſtles were ſent of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1, 12. and ſpake, as God by his Spirit directed them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26. Theſe were the publiſhers of our Religion, both in the common truthes of our Chriſtianitie, as alſo in the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from our aduerſaries. And for proofe, wee appeale to the Apoſtles and Prophets extant writings. Our Religion is written in thoſe holy Scriptures, the Booke of God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is prooued. It is propagated and preſerued by ſuch meanes, as be ordained of God, of which alſo before. It is receiued, beleeued, conſcience made of it, onely by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit of God. It bringeth men to the true knowledge of God, to beleeue onely in God, to worſhip onely God, onely to honour God, and to be ruled onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the will of God. Its onely vpheld and preſerued by Gods, and not by mans power. This will eaſily bee gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if men conſider what weake meanes, in mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath ſpred it abroad, and brought it into eſteeme with ſuch as profeſſe it truly, (to wit) onely <hi>preaching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>conſtantly ſuffering</hi> in the defence thereof. Alſo, the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:173372:23"/>
ſmall number, and meaneneſſe of the perſons for the moſt part, which haue from the dayes of Ieſus Chriſt, made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof; and withall, the little worldly policy vſed for helpe to ſupport it. But on the other ſide, if the enemies thereof be well conſidered, who haue continued from the beginning of the Goſpell, perpetually endeuouring to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine our Religion, euery one will yeeld it to be the very hand of God, that maintaineth it. The multitude of them out of the Church are infinite; as Iewes, Gentiles, Saracens, Turkes, and a world of other Infidels. The Heretikes which haue riſen vp, and gone out from the true Church, and haue laboured to ſhake the very foundation of our Chriſtian Faith, very many. The Hypocrites and prophane, are too many, which profeſſing the ſame together with vs, yet are deadly enemies to the effectuall operation thereof, denying the power of it, and deriding ſuch as ſtriue to liue ſtrictly, and would expreſſe the liuely vertue and force of it. What diuiſions, what varietie of ſects and ſchiſmes, haue, and doe yet hinder the growth of our Religion? And laſtly, theſe laſt Enemies of it, the Papiſts, vnder that Antichriſt of Rome; againſt whom, if God himſelfe had not fought, and vpheld our Religion, they had ere this, vtterly extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. And who will denie this, that ſeriouſly conſidereth our ſimplicitie, and their deepe policie; our too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, their ſtrong combination; our ſmall ſtrength, their great power; our meane eſtates, their abundance of wealth and treaſures; our more then ſupine careleſneſſe, their continuall watchfulneſſe, and daily endeuours, which poſſibly Satan can put into their hearts, to root out our holy profeſſion? as by their cruell Inquiſition, mercileſſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, barbarous Maſſacres, horrible Treaſons, vniuſt Inuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bloody Warres, the neuer to be forgotten Gunpowder plot, killing of Kings, faithleſſe and treacherous dealings, playing faſt and looſe with vs by lying Equiuocations, and mentall Reſeruations, in all couenants, promiſes, and oathes: beſides their ſhameleſſe belying our perſons, foule and falſe taxing vs of errours and hereſies, imputed to our doctrine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:173372:23"/>
and Religion, Libertiniſme, Atheiſme, and other abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; their flattering of Kings, and ſuggeſtion of falſhoods of diſloyaltie againſt ſuch, as they find beſt affected to our Religion; their politike framing of their religion for worldly reſpects, to euery mans humor, to entangle the ſooner mens minds, to get the more to them; beſides all thoſe helliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices before mentioned in the firſt argument, among which is the corrupting of Fathers, and the Writings of learned men, both old and new, that ſo we might be altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all humane teſtimonies to witneſſe with vs, or any helpe of man, but to be left to ſtand (as indeed wee doe) by the hand of God, the onely Author of our Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the onely bleſſed Preſeruer of the ſame hitherto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther</hi> was borne; who now alſo euen in theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome times doth keepe it on foote, againſt all the power and policie of our Enemies, prayſed bee his holy Name for euer and euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>If our Aduerſaries thinke, that here is all that can be ſaid for vs, or that onely we can thus prooue our Religion, they are much deceiued: for much more may bee ſaid, and alſo otherwiſe, euen by Hiſtorie, may our Religion, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours be ſhewed at large.

They doe begin with Chriſt, then follow they on with Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and other Biſhops of Rome on the one ſide: on the other, they place the Virgin <hi>Marie, Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle, with other Apoſtles and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts: then they reckon vp Chriſtian Churches, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Corinthians, Galatians, and the reſt, to whom Saint
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:173372:24"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> wrote; and ſo they run on along to the end. Now this is it, that thou ſhouldeſt demand of them, and put them to proue, whether Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles taught, and all the reſt there mentioned,<note place="margin">What to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them, and to preſſe them vnto.</note> did learne and practiſe, all that the Church of Rome now doth? If they can ſhew this but in the firſt hundred of yeeres, profeſſe thou to be ſatisfied, and not to require farther after a continuall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in the Ages following. Preſſe this home to them, ſtand onely vpon this; this is plaine dealing, to begin with them, where they begin. And if they will not indeuour to ſatisfie thee in this, certainely the Catalogue of the names of Chriſt, of his Apoſtles, and the reſt in the Primitiue Church, are put onely in the forefront to coozen thee, if they can. For will they begin it with Chriſt, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt, and yet not proue them of their preſent Religion? If they can, why doe they it not? Why doe they ſeeke to put it off? If they cannot, why claime they theſe, for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and maintainers of this their preſent Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? I ſay, their preſent Romiſh Religion; becauſe there is a great difference betweene the Religion <hi>once at Rome</hi> in the Apoſtles dayes, and the Religion <hi>of Rome now</hi>; that of <hi>the Church</hi> then, this of the <hi>Court and faction</hi> there now. And here I pray thee wel vnderſtand this one thing, to wit, what they meane by <hi>their Religion,</hi> as we alſo doe by <hi>our Religion</hi>; we neither ſide took it only for that wherein we both do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but chiefely becauſe of the diſtinct differences thereof either from the other: this obſerue, that thou mayſt not be deceiued by the Catalogue. And the better to cleare thy iudgement therein, let them ſhew thee, that Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">What are the things, which in their Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue from Chriſt, they muſt proue thoſe in the firſt Age to haue main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</note> that alſo his Apoſtles, with the reſt, in the firſt hundred of yeeres, taught not onely that, wherein wee and they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree (for ſo they gaine nothing to themſelues, but the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue therein ſerues for vs, aſwell as for them) but alſo that they taught and obſerued all their now preſent differences from vs: as for example, let them ſhew that then was taught, and the Churches learned;</p>
               <p n="1">I. To picture the holy Trinitie, to make Images, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

               <p n="2">II. To hold the Scriptures to be imperfect and obſcure, that the Apocryphall bookes were of diuine Authoritie, the Latine Tranſlation was to bee authenticall, that Traditions were to be added to perfit the Scriptures, concerning neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie matters of ſaluation; that the authoritie of the holy Scriptures doth depend vpon the authoritie of the Church; that they are not to be made ſo free, as to be read and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all without licence.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To hold ſeuen Sacraments, that Baptiſme is to bee adminiſtred with hallowed Water, with Chryſme, Salt, Spittle, Coniuring, and other deuices.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. To beleeue, that the Prieſt may receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, and yet many other Chriſtians to be there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent looking on: that the Bread without the Cup, is to bee giuen to the people: that after the words of conſecration, the Bread is turned into the very naturall body of Chriſt, the accidents of Bread and Wine onely remaining, but not the ſubſtance: that it is to be adored and prayed vnto, and to be carried about in Proceſſion: that it is to bee admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred with ſuch varietie of garments, alterations of geſtures, and change of voyce: that it is a propitiatorie ſacrifice for the quicke and the dead.</p>
               <p n="5">V. To make prayer, to adminiſter the Sacraments, and to ſay all diuine Seruice in an vnknowne Tongue; to ſay the Creed amongſt Prayers, the <hi>Aue Marie</hi> as a prayer, with the <hi>Pater noster</hi> vpon Beades with Croſſes, and that to a certaine number, repeating the <hi>Aue Marie</hi> fortie times, and the <hi>Pater noſter</hi> foure times, with a <hi>Creed</hi> at the end: that many thus praying, though they vnderſtand not the words which they vtter, yet hauing a good intent, they do a work pleaſing to God.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. To hold the Church of Rome to bee the Mother Church, the onely One, Holy, Catholike, and Apoſtolike Church: that it could not erre, and that all which ſhould

               <p n="7">VII. To hold the Pope of Rome to bee Chriſts Vicar, and <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor: that all ſhould depend vpon him, as vpon their Head: that he as Pope cannot erre <hi>è Cathedrâ:</hi> that to him, as of right, belongeth the ſpirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall iuriſdiction, and ſo hath authoritie to make Lawes, to bind conſcience, to depoſe Kings, and to diſpoſe of their Kingdomes: that he and his Clergy are exempt from the authoritie of Secular power.</p>

               <p n="9">IX. To ſet vp high and worldly dignities in the Church, as Kingly Cardinals, Prince-like vnpreaching Prelates and Paſtors ouer Congregations, not able to teach them: to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low infinite Orders of Monkes, Friers and Nunnes.</p>

               <p>In their Catalogue they are to bring Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and all the reſt therein named, for teachers and profeſſours of theſe things and the like, elſe are they not to be reputed of this their preſent Religion.</p>
               <p>Vrge them (friendly Reader) vnto the proofe of theſe particular differences; till then, keepe thy right ſtanding, and be not mooued with a ſhew of names.</p>

Secondly, by general Councels, or by

any one generall Councell within 600. yeres after Chriſt (in which ſpace were moſt famous &amp; renowned Councels) that hath condemned any maine doctrine of our Faith for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Thirdly, by the vnanimous conſent, and generall voyce of the Greeke and Latine Fathers, for that ſpace condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame for hereſie, and for an impious opinion.

Thirdly, <hi>in our deeds,</hi> which we teach to be done, or bid to be left vndone, any thing againſt any of the Commandements in the Decalogue, the rule of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. If they can thus fairely and euidently proceede, they ſhould doe well ſo to conuince vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Proteſtants are not conuicted of obſtinacie.</note> if any impious opinions could be found among vs, it muſt be conſidered, whether they be broched by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſons, or tenents held of the Church in her publike Records: If the former, then are they not the Churches; if the Church ſhould hold any ſuch, how can they proue, that ſhe maintaineth them obſtinately? For obſtinacy is not to be imputed vnto vs, till all lawfull, good, and ſufficient meanes haue been vſed to conuince our iudgement, and the ſame alſo by ſuch, as haue lawfull and full authority to iudge and determine thereof. But hitherto this hath not been done, neither can it be, but by a lawfull and free gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell, which the Conuenticle of Trent was not:<note place="margin">See the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Councell of Trent.</note> till then we are not to be condemned of obſtinacy, and ſo as yet no Heretikes.</p>

For we very willingly deſire to heare her ſentence: but where can that bee, except in a generall Councels determination? therein to heare the Catholike Church ſpeaking to vs from the Scriptures, we greatly long for, we readily ſubmit vnto.

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:173372:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>As for the Church of Romes authoritie, we doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it ouer vs, becauſe it is not, nor euer was in her beſt eſtate, the Catholike Church, but onely a particular Church, which now alſo is a party queſtioned. And therfore her authoritie for her ſelfe againſt vs, is no more of vs to be regarded, then by them our Churches authority for her ſelfe againſt them. Seeing then that by their definition, wee are not conuinced of hereſie, wee are not out of the Church as Heretikes.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Proteſtants are no Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</note>II. <hi>Not as Schiſmatikes.</hi> For albeit we haue no depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this Romiſh Church, yet are we no Schiſmatikes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for that we keepe communion with the Catholike Church, into which we by Baptiſme were admitted, which is the body of Chriſt, and wee truly members thereof, in faith and loue,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.20.</note> through the worke of Gods Spirit, being built vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelfe being the Corner-ſtone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe this Church of Rome hath falne from the faith and obedience commended by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to be in the Church at Rome in his time, as appeareth in many particulars before named, which the Church firſt planted at Rome, neuer taught, neuer beleeued, nor practiſed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we no Schiſmatikes for leauing her in thoſe things, wherein ſhe hath left the true and Apoſtolike Church at the beginning.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for that wee doe not breake off from her ſimply, but in ſome reſpect, that is, as farre foorth as ſhe hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her former ſelfe; ſo that if ſhee would returne to the Catholike Faith and Religion, and forſake her <hi>Trentiſme, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitiſme,</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> the inuentions of her owne, added to that which firſt ſhe did profeſſe, wee want not charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, to vnite our ſelues vnto her againe. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, neither our true loue to God, nor true loue to his Church, will ſuffer vs to liue with her, ſo defiled as ſhe is, in the ſpirituall bond of ſacred loue, which knits the true members of Chriſt one to another. Heauenly charity, which maketh this vnitie, admitteth not of ſuch things into the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173372:27"/>
vnitie of faith, as bee taught and practiſed in that Church, both ſinfull againſt God, and pernicious to mens ſoules, yea, vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to them, without hearty repentance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee haue a warrant, yea,<note place="margin">Let them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the books which prooue her the great Whore, Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and the Pope Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, if any denie theſe things.</note> a commandement from God, to ſeparate our ſelues from her, for that ſhe is become the great Whore, and ſpirituall Babylon, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 18.4. This charge of God freeth vs from Schiſme: for there is no ſin, no Schiſme, in that which God commandeth to be done.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, we by leauing this Romiſh Church, doe not deuide our ſelues from the true, Catholike and Apoſtolike Church, but by this ſeparation doe we indeed returne to the vnitie of it, and to our firſt bleſſed eſtate therein, when firſt the Goſpell was here planted in this Iland by Apoſtles, or Apoſtolicall men, which came hither, not from Rome, but from Ieruſalem, our Mother Church, where the Lord and his bleſſed Apoſtles firſt began to teach, and erect a Church, which is the Church we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto in doctrine and worſhip of God: from which Holy, Catholike, and Apoſtolike Church, wee were drawne by the vſurping and tyrannical power and iuriſdiction of the Pope and his faction, and the generall backſliding of this his Church. So as this which they call Schiſme, is no Schiſme in vs, but a forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſchiſme in them, and is only a returning vnto, and a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of our ſelues againe to our former vnion with Chriſts true Church, beginning at Ieruſalem, and planted here many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres, before the Monke <hi>Auſtin</hi> euer came into England.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">In ſumma part. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>39.</hi> de Schiſmate.</note> 
                  <hi>They are properly called Schiſmatikes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aquinas) which of their owne accord and will, ſeparate themſelues from the vnitie of the Church.</hi> If this be true in the iudgement of this their owne ſo greatly honoured Doctor, then certainely wee are no Schiſmatikes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, of our owne accord and will we make not a ſeparation, but are inforced therto by the power of Gods commandement, to come out of this Babylon, to auoyde her ſinnes,<note place="margin">Reuel. 18.4.</note> to eſcape thereby her puniſhments. She her ſelfe hath cauſed deuiſion, and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ſhee once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See for theſe <hi>Catal. Teſt. ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. pa.</hi> 27. <hi>to</hi> 70. in the laſt Edition.</note> do in many particulars witneſſe againſt her. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore wils vs to auoyde her, and ſuch as cauſe deuiſion and offences, contrary to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:173372:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Apoſtles doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. It may ſeeme from hence that a faction begun euen then among you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we doe not ſeparate from <hi>the Church,</hi> that is, from the vniuerſall Catholike Church, but from <hi>a Church,</hi> that is, the particular Church of Rome: for <hi>Thomas</hi> doth not ſay, He is a Schiſmatike, which ſeparateth from a Church, but from the vnitie of the Church, to wit, the Church vniuerſall, which is but one. For indeed, no reaſon can bee giuen, why any ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide themſelues from the true Catholike Church: but good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be giuen, why a particular Church may be, and ought to bee forſaken; as wee doe giue, for our departing from the Church of Rome: for we are commanded to forſake Idolaters, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. Heretikes, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. ſuch as bring not the doctrine of Chriſt, and doe not abide therein, 2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. and her that is called Babylon, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 18.4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, before we can be Schiſmatikes, we muſt forſake the vnitie of the Church. Now wherein ſtands this vnitie? Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it only in affection of loue, or alſo in the faith of the truth? For both theſe graces the Apoſtle commendeth the Churches, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.15. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. and faith is preferred to the firſt place in both Scriptures. We haue not forſaken the vnitie of the Faith, of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Eph</hi> 4.13. For we teach the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and no other in any thing, when we differ from this preſent Church of Rome, which hath loſt her firſt faith, of truth in many things. Now, can true diuine loue be there kept, where faith is loſt? or can there be charitie to vnite, where do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth deuide? Can light and darkeneſſe, truth and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood cohabite in loue? Truth and loue onely dwell together; and for truths ſake, loue ſeparateth from falſhood, whereſoeuer ſhe finds it. And therefore except they can proue, that we haue loſt the vnitie of faith, wee haue not forſaken the vnitie of the Church in loue, as the former reaſons ſhew.</p>
               <p>To conclude, were the Prieſts and Leuites Schiſmatikes, which left the people of Iſrael,<note place="margin">2. Ch. 11.13, 14</note> once the people of God in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> and <hi>Salomons</hi> dayes, and many hundred yeeres before, when Idolatrie, vnder pretence to worſhip no falſe, but the true God, was ſet vp, and they not ſuffered then to do their office vnto the Lord, as their office required? If they were not, no more are we.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:173372:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For why doe we forſake the Romiſh Church? Is it not, becauſe ſhe hath ſet vp a new manner of ſeruice vnto God, new kinds of Prieſts, new Holy-dayes, new Sacraments, new Orders, and will not permit the Lords Seruants and Miniſters to do their Offices vnto the Lord, as he hath by his written Word preſcribed?</p>
               <p>Therefore ſeeing we are not guiltie of Schiſme, we are not as Schiſmatikes out of the Church, into which by Baptiſme wee are receiued.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Not as excommunicate perſons.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proteſtants not excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate perſons.</note> For if we be neither He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, nor Schiſmatikes, vpon what other ground will they iudge vs to be proceeded againſt? There are other cauſes, for which men are excommunicate: but in this queſtion our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries cannot pleade any ſuch. Againe, I aske, if wee bee excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, who hath pronounced the ſentence? Is it the Romiſh Church? By what authoritie? Their Church is not the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, but only a particular, as ours is, and it is by vs que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, and therefore in reaſon it cannot bee both a Partie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and alſo a Iudge againſt vs in her owne cauſe. Thirdly, we doe appeale from her vnrighteous iudgement, to a lawfull generall Councell, where, vpon earth, our cauſe is onely to bee heard and decided lawfully.

Their damnation is more iuſt, when they ſinne in any meaſure, then ſuch as want this power, though they fall by infirmitie into greater ſinnes.</p>
