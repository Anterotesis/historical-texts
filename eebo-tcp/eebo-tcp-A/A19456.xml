         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

COVBRIDGE, MINISTER OF
THE WORD IN CVMBERLAND,
to the zealous Proteſtants his Brethren,
concerning the Printing, Title, and vſe
of this admirable Ladder, worthily called
The Ladder of Hell.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onſidering that this Ladder
was firſt framed and entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>The Ladder of Hell,</hi> by a
Papiſt, to the great diſgrace
(as hee conceined) of our
Proteſtant Religion; I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that ſome of you (dearely beloued Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
will wiſh that it had been quite ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
and neuer ſeene light: yet, (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it containeth nothing but a collection
of certaine ſentences ſet downe in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
bookes of twelue principall Pillars of
our Church) I thought it not amiſſe to ſet it
forth, juſt as I found it, vnder your protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
knowing well, that euery zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
can with the dexteritie of his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſpirit turne all, though neuer ſo plainly
ſeeming ill, to at leaſt a ſeeming good ſenſe:
as for example, wheras the Papiſt called this
<pb facs="tcp:24025:3"/>
collection of ſentences, <hi>The Ladder of Hell</hi>
becauſe in his judgement the beleefe and,
practiſe of it leadeth a ſoule directly to hell.
Yet one of our new learning (conſidering
that Ladders are made rather to helpe men
vpward then downeward) wil ſay it may be
called <hi>The Ladder of Hell,</hi> becauſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
and practiſe of it will lift ſoules out of
hell. And with reaſon may this be ſaid, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
one ground of our new doctrine be
true,<note place="margin">Caluin. in c. 30. Iſa. Hermonia ad cap. 3. Mat. v. 12. I. Inſtit. c. 25. n. 12.</note> to wit, that <hi>Hell</hi> is (no ſuch locall place
in which are fire and other torments, as is
ſaid by the ancient Fathers, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
themſelues, to be prepared for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
and other damned creatures, but) only
a certaine terror and horror of an afflicted
conſcience, the which may in ſome meaſure
be felt euen in this world, and is ordinarily
felt after ſin commited euen by Proteſtants,
vntill by beleeuing firmely, and practiſing
freely the points of doctrine contained in
this Ladder, they come by degrees to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
all things, to wit, all Lawes of God
and man: and all ſcruple of minde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
of conſcience, and all feare of Death,
Iudgement, and Hell, which eſtate of mind,
it is like diuers zealous Proteſtants haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
attained vnto, eſteeming themſelues
hereby to be not onely freed from hell, but
<pb facs="tcp:24025:3"/>
to haue attained a kind of heauen in earth:
<hi>Marry the doubt is,</hi> whether this their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wil laſt alwayes, as true heauen ought to
doe, or whether this haſtie freeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hell of care, feare, remorſe &amp; ſorrow
in this life, will not plung them into a moſt
bitter feeling of remorſe in the houre of
death, and into intollerable torments of the
eternall Hell in the next life. The which
doubt being in the judgement of ſome, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Papiſticall ſcruple, I will leaue to bee
diſcuſſed at better leaſure: It ſhall ſuffice my
preſent purpoſe onely to declare the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
vſes, which for the preſent time may be
made of this excellent Ladder, both by
Papiſts and Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I finde that the Papiſts meane to
make this ſhort Ladder ſerue for an anſwer
of many long diſcourſes made by Proteſtant
Miniſters in bookes or Sermons, in which
they obiect the ill liues of ſome Papiſts; the
which obiections the Papiſts doe retort
more ſtrongly againſt vs Proteſtants, who
cannot deny, but that ſince the light of the
new Goſpell was by <hi>Luther</hi> brought into
the world,<note place="margin">Luther in Poſtilla ſupra E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangel. dom. 1. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentus.</note> men are (as <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe
coufeſſed) more reuengeful, more conetous,
more vnmercifull, more vnmodeſt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly,
and much worſe then they were in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry;
<pb facs="tcp:24025:4"/>
the reaſon whereof (ſay the Papiſts)
is for that the very doctrine it ſelfe of the
new Goſpellers, doth not onely not afford
ſuch effectuall reſtraints and remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſinne, as is in the ancient Catholike
Religion, but alſo hath (as appeareth by the
ſteps of this Ladder) diuers expreſſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which doe plainly open the gappe to
all licentious libertie of lewde life, far more
then can bee imagined to bee done by any
principles of the Papiſts doctrine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Papiſts conclude that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, whoſe doctrine is ſo vnholy,
cannot be a holy Religion inſpired by the
holy Ghoſt, but ſuggeſted (as<note n="a" place="margin">Luth. de abroganda miſſa pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uata, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> 
               <hi>Luther</hi> the
firſt Author confeſſeth ſome part of it (to
wit, the deniall of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe)
to haue beene ſuggeſted to him) by Satan
himſelfe, the enemy of all true Religion and
holineſſe.</p>
            <p>The zealous Proteſtant not much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this, or whatſoeuer other arguments
made by Papiſts, find out other vſes of this
Ladder: as for example. Firſt, it teacheth
euery one of them to exerciſe heroicall acts
of their<note n="b" place="margin">I call it new fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, becauſe I finde not in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that a man is made iuſt by confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beleeuing that hee is Iuſt, but rather by humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging ones ſelfe to be a ſinner, as appeareth in the Parable of the Phariſee and the Publican. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</note> new-found Iuſtifying Faith, by
<pb facs="tcp:24025:4"/>
which they beleeue that they are juſt, holy,
and of the number of the predeſtinate, not
onely by hauing a good hope, (as the poore
Papiſts haue) when they ſee or feele ſome of
thoſe things in themſelues, which by the
holy Scriptures they learne to be ſignes of
true Iuſtice (to wit, repentance of ſins paſt,
carefulneſſe to auoid ſinne in time to come,
diligence in doing good workes; &amp;c.) but
alſo by infallible and abſolute beleefe, as of
a chiefe article of their Chriſtian faith, euen
at ſuch times as they neither ſee, nor feele
any ſuch ſignes, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they euidently
ſee in themſelues contrary ſignes, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
euen when they actually do thoſe works
of the fleſh,<note place="margin">Gal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> of which Saint. <hi>Paul</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
That they who doe ſuch things, ſhall
not obtaine the Kingdome of God. Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Proteſtants, I ſay, maugre this threat of
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> are taught by this Ladder to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
boldly that they are Saints, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſſe
ſaluation, notwithſtanding they
commit neuer ſo many moſt horrible ſins.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Ladder teacheth them to
caſt away all feare of God, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his Iuſtice, in inflicting preſent or
future paines for ſinne (which is called ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
feare) but alſo of ſeparation from God,
which feare cannot ſtand with our new Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
Faith, in regard we muſt hold it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb facs="tcp:24025:5"/>
impoſſible that we can bee ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from God, and conſequently wee muſt
caſt away this fear, although neuer ſo much
commended in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By this admirable Ladder, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Proteſtants may be deliuered from all
inward remorſe of conſcience, &amp; may come
to that higheſt perfection of our new Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
which conſiſteth in a neglect of al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
the which cannot be attained on a
ſudden, but muſt be gained (as <hi>Luther</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
gained it) by entering into a terrible
conflict, and fighting againſt ones owne
conſcience; the difficulty of which combate
ariſeth out of three heads.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the letter of the written word,
which ſeemeth euery where to croſſe thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
liberty of conſcience, and to forbid the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any thing againſt conſcience. But our
new ſpirituall man, who judgeth all things,
will oppoſe againſt this killing letter of
Scripture, which reſtraineth our freedome,
the quickening ſpirit of this Ladder, which
alloweth liberty of neglecting conſcience.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is an old Tradition of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
in fauour of conſcience, which hath by
long cuſtome taken a deepe roote in vs. But
the zealous Proteſtant, who accounteth
Papiſtry a great blindneſſe, will eaſily defie
this among other Papiſticall traditions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:24025:5"/>
The third is an inueterate opinion and
feeling of conſcience engrauen in the very
nature and fleſh of mans heart. But we new
ſpirited men do know old nature to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and that the fleſh profiteth nothing.</p>
            <p>Thus my deare Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you may ſee what
vſes may be made of this admirable Ladder.</p>
            <p>It remaineth that in a word I alſo declare,
why I make choice to dedicate it vnto you,
and to put it in print vnder your protection.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe the authors out of
whom theſe ſentences were collected, were
all zealous Proteſtants. Secondly, becauſe
none now adaies will (as I ſuppoſe) ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
beleeue &amp; endeuor to practiſe according
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> theſe points, but only zealous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s.
Thirdly, beauſe none but ſuch zealous
Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who frame their liues according
to this Ladder, can well vnderſtand how it
is poſſible that this Ladder can be good, or
how it ſhould deliuer one out of Hell, and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently, why it ſhould be ſtiled in that
ſenſe, in which I ſtile it, <hi>The Ladder of Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be the Papiſt, which firſt framed
this Ladder, wil play vpon vs with his text,
<hi>Woe vnto you that call euil good, and good euill,
Iſa.</hi> 5. 20. But wee care not for his text, for
we can cry as lowd, and ſay as faſt, <hi>Wo</hi> vnto
him, and although the world will, witneſſe
that he hath better reaſon to vſe this text a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:24025:6"/>

comber our conſciences with their contrary

heads, by adding to this Ladder certain ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
threatning hell and damnation to
ſinners: for although we profeſſe by our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
Faith, that we are ſure to be ſaued,
and that we neede not feare to be damned:
yet I confeſſe, when I ſeriouſly examine my
guilty conſcience, and by ſearching, find the
holy Scriptures themſelues to pronounce
plainly eternall damnation to all ill liuers. I
cannot chooſe but be bodily afraid leſt the

Libertine doctrine taught by our new Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers,
