            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I must ingeniously confesse your worth so farre to transcend my weakenesse, that I am almost silent in the Proem ere I enter on the Epitasis: yet presuming on your generous disposition, which ever waiteth on sollid Judgement, I thus proceede.</p>
            <p>Your breeding (Right Honourable) next to a Scholler hath beene chiefly in Mercature, and of your sufficiency therein, you have not onely given to this City ample sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; but to the severall parts of this Christian World: your personall Travell in your youth acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you with the passages and proceedings in other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne regions, have bettered your conceptions (now growing towards Age) in the management of State Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy in your native Realme: of which since the time that you were first chosen Alderman, you have given rare President; none having decided more differences, ended
<pb facs="tcp:4258:3"/>
more doubtfull Causes; or beene a greater Peace-maker than your honoured selfe.</p>
            <p>And for the multiplicity of your Commerce, it is most manifest, that you have long Traded (to begin with the nearest first) in the Low Countries, <hi>France, Spaine, Italy, Venice, East India;</hi> and moreover in <hi>Greene-land, Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> and <hi>Turkey,</hi> of which three noble societies last named you are at this present Governour. History tells us that divers Praetors and Tribunes during the time of their Authority, have bin so indulgent over the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge; that they have not onely ratified the good Edicts of others, but devised wholsome Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of themselves: when <hi>Solon</hi> swayed the Senate no Creditor had power over the Debters bodies, but their goods onely. In <hi>Platoes</hi> Common-weale all excesse was prohibited, which amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> was cald <hi>Lex sumptuaria. Acilius glabrio</hi> made an Edict <hi>De pecuniis repitundis,</hi> Commanding all mony taken by bribery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, or other indirect meanes to bee restored, cald <hi>Lex Acilia:</hi> Another compelled the <hi>Plebe</hi> to a liberall contribution towards all publicke Showes, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs; which was Titled <hi>Lex fannia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to indanger the just reproofe of a presumptions arrogance, in prompting your Lordships in the studied Duties of your succeeding charge, I conclude with that Spanish <hi>Refran: Embia al sabio a la embaxada, Y no le degat nada;</hi> still remembring that of <hi>Cato, Imperium gero non miht sed Civitatiet socus.</hi>

               <p>IS a Chariot drawne by two Cammells, upon eithers back an <hi>Indian</hi> mounted, and habited according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Country: of Cammells there be two sorts, the <hi>Bactrian,</hi> and <hi>Arabian;</hi> and differ thus: The <hi>Bactrians</hi> have two bunches or swellings on the backe, and are called <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medaries:</hi> the <hi>Arabians</hi> but one, and another on the breast,

on which they leane when they lye downe to rest: They want the upper order of teeth, and are some times used in War, in velocity exceeding horses; but most commonly for burdens, every one being acquainted with his owne lading according to his strength; lesse weight they desire not, and more they will not beare: they are taught to kneele till they have their load, and then they rise of themselves. Neither in their journey will they change their pace; they can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from water foure dayes together, but then they drinke as well for the time past, as that to come; yet not before with their feet they have troubled the streame: they live to fifty yeares, and some to an hundred; and though the pelleted Lyons might have serv'd more properly to this place, as being supporters of the Armes belonging to the Right Worshipfull Company of the <hi>Drapers;</hi> yet these are as genuine to the purpose: to show his Lord-ships generall negotiation in all kinds of Merchandise whatsoever.</p>

               <p>AS the last had a relation to the Company in generall, so this hath reference to his Lordship in particular, as he is a noble Merchant; having it hereditary from his worthy Father Mr. <hi>William Garway,</hi> who was not onely a great Benefactor to the Right Worshipfull Society of the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> but an indulgent Educator of divers yong men, who have since prov'd great and Eminent adventurers; some attaining even to the prime Magistracy of this our Metropolis.</p>

Day (then limited) will not afford it a speech: which I the rather omit; because in the last representation of the like, the excellency of Merchandise, the commodity of shipping, with the antiquity and profit of Navigation was delivered at large: I therefore come to the sixt and last. which is</p>
               <p>AN artificiall Architecture best able (for the Worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-ship) to commend it selfe, and being apparent to the publick view, lesse needeth my description. It presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the calamities of War, &amp; the blessednesse of peace, <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Pacatus;</hi> bearing the Title of the whole Triumph: In one part thereof are exprest to the life, the figures of <hi>Death, Famine, Sicknesse, strage,</hi> &amp;c. in the other <hi>Prosperity, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Health, Wealth,</hi> but especially the free and frequent Preaching of the Word and Gospell. I desire not to swell these few pages to small purpose, therefore thus briefly of both. Peace is the Tranquility, and calme quiet of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, free from Section, tumult, uproares and faction; a Plantation of rest, ease and security; with all the flourishing ornaments of earthly felicity: peace is the end at which War aimeth: Honour the fruits of peace; and good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ground of either, asking no lesse wisedome to preserve it, then valour to obtain it: for Concord and Unity maketh a mite to increase to a Magazin, when discord and debate in any publick Weale, or private society, lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a mountaine to a Mole-hill; and therefore <hi>Pacem te poscimus omnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now of the contrary, War is of two sorts, Civill, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. Domesticke War is the over-throw and ruine of all Estates, and Monarchies, and the incendiary of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is most execrable, begetting contempt of God, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners, and disobedience to Magistrates: change

of Lawes, neglect of Justice, and dis-estimation of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and liberall Arts: But forraigne Warre is that) by <hi>Plato,</hi> cald a more gentle and generous contention) onely lawfull, being undertooke to propagate true Religion; or to procure a continuance of Peace. Any War may be begun with great facility, but is ended with much difficulty; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it in his power to end it who begins it: to raise a combustion is in the power of any Coward, but to appease it lyes onely in the mercy of the Conquerour: &amp; therefore much safer and better is certaine peace, than hoped for Victory: the first is in our Will, the latter in the Will of the Gods.</p>

                  <p>Concerning these two excellent Artists, Master <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Master <hi>Mathias Christmas,</hi> brothers; the exquisite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of these Triumphall Models; I can onely say thus much: their workeman-ship exceeds what I can expresse in words, and in my opinion their performance of what they undertake, is equall at least, if not transcendent over any's who in the like kind shall strive to parralell them.</p>
