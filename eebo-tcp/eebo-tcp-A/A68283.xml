            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Against the Sunne (vpon which no reasonable creature can stedfastly fixe his mortall eyes, least they be dazeled, infeebled, or blinded with the pretious cleeretie thereof (being another type of sacred Maiestie) that imperiall bird soueraigning ouer the swift fethered creatures of the ayre by nature opposeth his sight: as <hi>Orus Apollo</hi> writeth in his hieroglyphiks, how the Sages of Aegypt and Chaldaean Priests (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would signifie diuine power, humane Empire, preheminence, blood, or victorie) did pourtraict an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. What miracles he findeth through his stedfast, sharpe, and penetrating inspection within that sanctified Orbe of bright ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, may be referred to those misticall naturallists, which in the Metaphysicall cardes of their reason haue obscurely shadowed those things, that by mythologies are out of many curious heades from farre shot at, by some neere hit, and by very few truely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. <hi>Caius Iul.

This Eagle also viuely representeth vnto vs, your Maiesties person, being onely your Highnesses scepter-bearing bird, with siluer fethers; which with his auspicious wings sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doweth the crownes of this Britaine Monarchie with peace of soule and bodie rooted in your blessed posteritie for euer.

Sanctitie &amp; Iustice therefore (as I first said) by the propagation, corroboration, and aeternization of all crowns and Monarchies, are the two maine pillars of principalitie; being those inseperable adiuncts of your right royall Maiesties lawfull and victorious quadruple crowne of Great Brittaine, France, and Ireland, composed of the 4. cardinall vertues, which in this ensuing myrrour, framed out of the 4. immediate ministers or columnes rather of kingly Maiestie, with all humble dutie subiecting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polished as they be, to your princely eyes, I present to your royall hands, vnder a special pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for my boldnes in daring as a poore vnlearned Scholler (which offereth his ignorance in some rude exercise vnto his learned Schoole-master) to trouble your sacred Maiestie with these imperfections. Howbeit, as euery man which writeth ought to rest vpon &amp; leane vnto the grace of his Patrone; so can it not choose, but that hauing chosen so gracious a Patrone, farre exceeding all other in goodnes, I shall finde more true grace and beneficence out of your royall nature, for this one Caracter of my bounden dutie respected by such a Soueraigne, then by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence of any subiect And therefore I presumed to your high Grace, being the Castalian spring head (which the Greek Sages did say to be patronized by that bright Lord of wisdome &amp; Poetrie) thinking there (after my labours) to refresh my troubled sences: where though vnworthy to tast, yet shal I receiue some ingenuous alacritie, by seeing that pure &amp; preciously-purling current. And that I may the more to my consolation contemplate the royall sun-shine and serenitie which enuironeth your sacred temples (though your Grace lay not apart the beames of your Maiestie) yet vouchsafe I beseech, with your diuine annointed hands to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint

these eyes of your humble subiect with the balmie dew of your gracious beneuolence, that I may bee the better inabled to looke vpon that consecrated Orbe of true maiestie; for had I been so timerous or faint, as in the regard of the vnworthinesse of my Booke protected the same by some priuate friend: then had I somewhat withdrawen from worth of the matter, which (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the methode and disposition thereof deserueth) doth also merite a royall Master, and had miscarried in the manner of my proceeding also: thinking that because these foure insuing estates immediately ministring vnder all crownes in euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, are protected by royall soueranitie, your Grace was fittest also to patronize these my simple studies wholy conuersing in the properties and attributes of those Offices; which shall bee most highly honoured by the maiesticall protection of such a vertuous King, to his poore subiects exceeding comfort. My consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration therefore was, that your Highnesse out of the Princely nature, which God with your Essence hath infused, would deigne so simple present of a poore Scholler, with the beneuolence which your Grace natiuely doth extend to learning: and that being hereafter published vnder that high Title many learned eyes, and curious fingers (not so much for the matter &amp; forme of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, as for the Maiestie patronizing it) would peruse these yong rules in this vnperfect accedence to gouernment, and percase beare them through diuers of your Maiesties Kingdomes.</p>

               <hi>Barnabe Barnes</hi> his Preface to the honourable and discrete Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue apportioned my foure bookes of Offices (wherin certaine speciall qualities and principles are expressed for generall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and the choise both of ciuill and martiall ministers in euery Commonwealth) vnto the foure vertues cardinall. For as much therefore as royall treasure (being the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of euery state, without which no principalities can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, or augment) ought to be mistically couched within the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine treasure Temperance (which is the moderator &amp; guide of her other three sister vertues ensuing) I therefore haue placed Temperance in this first Paralel, considering the resemblance which it should haue with a Princes treasure, so well in the manner of getting &amp; leuying, as in the sauing &amp; disbursing of mony by discrete moderation; which office of Treasurers possesseth the first booke of these offices.</p>
            <p>Prudence the substance of my second booke (deciphered &amp; figuredin the secret counsellors office) participateth of that reasonable moderation, which is expressed in the first. Also Tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the treasurer with a gracious mildnes &amp; motherly decency prudently pondereth and examineth all her actions, which are right noble and many, with her passions. Yet is it contrauertible whether temperance be passionate or no; though one of her sweetest graces gouerneth in patience.</p>
            <p>My third booke comprehendeth Iustice, which is in all causes seasoned with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite moderation and taste of ingenuous temperance, and prudence: temperance being of it selfe an indifferencie void of extremitie, viuely representeth Iustice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporate with equitie and prudence: because with a certaine prouident cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection it iustly weigheth all things in the balance of reason.</p>
            <p>My fourth booke (in the same rancke conteining certaine qualities of a true soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier) heroically representeth Fortitude; which with Temperance expressed in her patience, with Prudence in her foresight, and actions of honourable perill, with Iustice in the execution and maintenance of right, without any tolleration of publicke violence sisterly combineth: whereas semblably temperance in her bridling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining of inordinate appetite, prudence in her stout and constant equabilitie, Iustice in her seuere and firme equalitie (being merely pure from all blemishes of feare and affection) are all in themselues a fortitude.</p>
            <p>This is a diuine harmonie representing mentally by due distribution of humane charitie, the sacred vnison of mans soule sanctified with God. This is that mysterie
<pb facs="tcp:7338:9"/>
which <hi>Hermes, Salomon, Pythagoras, Solon, Plato, Socrates, &amp; Aristotle,</hi> haue all of them oracularly shadowed in their eternities of wisedome: and by these foure are all blessed Monarchies, Kingdomes, Commonweales, and policies susteined, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, directed and protected, that is by Temperance, Prudence, Iustice and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, shadowed as I said in the Treasurer, Counsellour, Iudge, and Souldier: for they be moderate, wise, iust, and valiant alike; that not any difference of their places is discerned, which of them may be greater or lesse then another.</p>
            <p>To this harmonious consent or concordance (whose ground in v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ison consisteth of a <hi>medium,</hi> which is the moderator or nauel-string of this unspeakeable musicke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the concealed and misticall accord of the numberlesse starres and planets contuning by the ineffable power of the most Almightie God in number and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonie; by which sacredforce he worketh his will in all creatures: from fat all influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of which diuine torches of light, by the most miraculous power of the most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie mouer, all worldly chaunces happen; which some not well aduised haue called the wheele of fortune) there are extreames by the most metaphisicall disposition ordained preuaricating or transgressing those foure diuine centres, or moderators, which I doe thus denominate, define, and distribute.</p>
            <p>To Temperance therefore my first countertenor, one base, and one alie: for out of discords with the countertenor (being moderator) is the concord composed of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmonie. The base hereof is couetous and vnnecessarie penurie when ability doth sufficiently reabound; the triple or alteis raised from extreame profusion or excesse, making a shrill and riotous confusion of all: one of these extreames continually conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in basenesse and the other in haughtinesse throughout; as in the rest ensuing.</p>
            <p>To Prudence which is my second countertenor or moderator, the base falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to follie; the triple or alte lifteth it selfe into malicious wilinesse and calliditie. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth follie participate with the first being couetousnesse, in that it wanteth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable discretion to make vse and comfort of Gods blessings bestowed: In extreame opposition thereof malicious craft or wilinesse accordeth with the first alte, that in publike and priuate affaires, it is a secret consumer; as extreame profusion or prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie wasteth both publike and priuate treasure; the persons qualitie being considered.</p>
            <p>Thirdly to iustice which is my next moderator, the vile base is dissolute indulgence or secure lenitie, when honestie by the couin of iniquitie lieth mortally wounded, and iniquitie scaping punishment receiueth honour and support: the triple or alte, extreme crueltie. Dissolute lenitie therefore in this consenteth with the first base which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led couetousnesse or vnreasonable sparing; for as much as contrarie to reason, it coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a confusion of other mens estates by sparing the wicked; as couctise doth of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens possessions by sauing of her owne, herein alluding to the second base which is follie: because such kind of foolish pittie or mercie (as some men ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e it) cannot haue any taste of discretion or charitie. Likewise extreame crueltie consenteth oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely with the first alte prodigalitie thus; by being so lauish and prodigall of blood as that other is of treasure: and with the second alte being craftie wilinesse; that in the prodigall effusion of blood, or in the tragicall end of impious, nefarious and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous treasons, conspiracies, and murthers, malicious craftinesse from crueltie diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7338:9"/>
Fourthly to fortitude (which is the last moderator) the base is basenesse of spirit or pusillanimitie, proceeding from inordinate sloath, feare, and luxurie, which is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, or rather mancipation of the mind to slauish and brutish affections, passions and perturbations, when appetite tyrannizeth ouer reason: the triple or alte audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temeritie. Pusill animitie therefore in this consenteth with miserable and auari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious sparing (which is the first base) that it is as fearefull and miserably parsimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious of a little harish blood, when honourable causes sommon it like a iudge in skarlet iustly to defend his owne with the guard of his heroicall spirits, and to contend for right; as that other basenesse is of treasure when speciall reasons doe most require a liberalitie: and with the second base being follie thus; that there can not appeare any more foolishnesse, then when people timerously and basely without resistance damne themselues voluntarily slaues to the tyrannous gallies of their owne inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enemies, wheras with a little paines and knitting of themselues vp together they might restraine or vanquish them both: also with the third base, which is secure leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for what weakenesse and abiection of mind can be discerned in one more then in another? for lenitie wilfully confoundeth euery priuate and publike estate; whereas basenesse or softnesse of spirit or pusillanimitie (the persons qualitie being respected) doth the same. Furthermore audacious temeritie, which violently without reason doth precipitate it selfe into perils herein oppositely concordeth with prodigalitie being the first alte; that it is more profuse (if possible) in effusion of blood, in rash partitipation and abbarretting of mutinies and quarrels then that other excesse is of treasure, of vnreasonable and inconsiderate expenses riot and surfeits: and with the second alte which is malicious wilinesse and calliditie; that whereas wrath and the venemous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of reuenge doth in a kind of desperation and temeritie, rush into the turbulent seas of danger: so doth malicious wilines by the secret labyrinths, snares, &amp; curious traps of mortall villainies make vp the mouth of mischiefe to bring about her diuelish designes; both of them being alike deepe in blood: and with the third alte or triple (being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie which is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ast consent in opposition with audacious temeritie) herein appeareth the finall concord of these discords euen that which reason and nature teacheth vs; how no greater cruelty can be shewed then that a man either vpon mere malice or some other hellish and fierie passion of wrath or blind affection (as a principall in the murther of himselfe (should rashly, violently, and irremediably croude into the speare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed troupe of perils, as <hi>Curtius</hi> and <hi>Decius,</hi> one mounted in armes on horseback to satisfie the wrath of the gods, vpon the maine carriere entred and was swallowed vp in the fierie gul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e, which prodigiously did exhale sulphurous and vnquenchable flames: the other being consul, armed in a Romane lacke or brigandine (as <hi>Liuy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth) did single on the same fashion run with full speede in gallop amid the battels of his enemies the Latines: and sacrificed himselfe for weale of the Romane hoast; where he thrasting his life into the very throats of his enemies choaked them that swallowedit.</p>
            <p>So that to conclude with this consent of discords; being the certaine confusion of euery the most florishing state where it tragically noiseth; as the first harmonious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance of the sphoericall vertues is the corroboration and amplification of euery kingdome which is formerly noted: so doe I say that Temperance is valiant, iust, and wise: Prudence is temperate, valiant, and iust; Iustice is wise, temperate, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
<pb facs="tcp:7338:10"/>
valor is iust, wise and temperat. In opposition semblably because the geometricall &amp; analogicall harmonie draweth these other rebels, excrescents, or excrements of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue rather, to this vniuersall muster, that they may be precisely viewed and measured by the cube of reason; receiuing prest and wages answerable to their natures and qualities: also for as much as it may be misconstrued by such as are more learned, or some that percase louen opposition, I will leaue this as a Paradox, whether auaritious misers be foolish, vniust, and timerous, whether timerous persons be miserable, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and vniust, whether vniust men be timerous, miserable and foolish, and whether fooles are vniust, timerous and miserable. In opposition likewise <hi>ex diametro,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prodigals in their actions generally be not audacious, cruell, and craftie: whether craftie knaues to fet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>h about their diuises be not prodigall, audacious, and cruell: if cruell fellows in their hopes or rather feares be not craftie, prodigall, and audacious: and if audacious persons in their distracted humors of desire, reuenge &amp; coller proue not cruell, craftie and prodigall. For a man (if he would perfectly know the secrets of gouernment) must warily serch forth these infestious leprosies of States; considering how there is not any good or bad in man-kinde, which is not contained in these oppositions: the causes of which euils being perfectly knowne, and presently remoued, all their effects of daunger must of force presently be drawne away with them. And he which cannot skill of this my concatenation, my wheele, or rather the true loue knot, and labyrinth of vertues with their opposites (though in other matters he vainely thinke himselfe wise) yet shall vndoubtedly misiudge of other mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, attributing and adiudgeing improperly good and bad qualities to people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary their depraued or natiue inclinations: nay moreouer I dare affirme, that he which shall perfectly learne and practise this Lesson shall soone attaine the true knowledge of himselfe.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, least I stand vpon these points more curiously then accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, I say that those kingdomes or Commonweales are blessed and victorious, whose Treasurers are valiant, iust, and prudent; whose counsellers are temperate, valiant &amp; iust: whose iudges are prudent, temperate, and valiant, whose captaines are iust, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and temperate: such as for example <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> whom <hi>Liuie</hi> magnifieth for his excellent quickenesse and dexteritie fit for all noble offices; as in the whole course of his life temperate and decored with moderation; as in his admirable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and sagacity to counsaile and direct in the most serious affaires of his countrey; as of his Iustice and skill in the lawes, which was incomparable; with his great courage &amp; valor in the wars, which was inuincible: al which I mentioned in my second booke. And in such acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished magistrates which by these instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s here insuing are made absolute is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined the whole morall force of a most gratious &amp; ample monarchie.</p>
            <p>These my beneuolent (though simple) Elucubrations, recommending heartily to your honorable constructions, I wish your welfare as mine owne; which if you with good Aequanimitie shall take fauourably, then haue I wonne the largest stipend of my studies that I could either trauaile or wish for. But if persons of vnindifferent cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and iudgement (as amongst many, there bee which may more then saltly taxe my labours) shall shew some seueritie more then criticall, their malignitie cannot preuaile; because I shall accompt no time mispent, which tending so much to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit of our yong country men is bestowed vpon such morall considerations.</p>

            <p>The respects are great, and those necessities important, which should vrge a prince to violence in those cases: yet a good Soueraigne can neuer haue cause of compulsion: For when the king which hath authoritie to constraine, vseth a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> facilitie to persuade, it importeth some vehement necessitie. Can any priuate Commonweale mount without tributarie wings? Or could the firmament of peace be cleere, if all clouds had not first beene dispersed with the thunder of warre? Are armes exercised without wages? Are ships prouided of men, victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and of artillerie, without mony?

It likewise augmenteth by the bold and industrious valour of them, which make great and honourable aduentures, as well by land seruice, as nauall for their countries glorie: returning after a long, laborious, and chargeable voyage, loaden with treasure and commodities. So did the noble Romane <hi>Aemilius</hi> bring from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Macedonians; which spoyle was so rich and great, that it eased the people of Rome many yeares after from tributes: of which hostile booties he was knowne not to bring any thing to his priuate houses or hampers, sauing onely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume of his triumphs and victories: which how well he demerited, is witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in noble historie.

Diuers other gallant gentlemen, borne here in England amongst vs, which being yet young and aliue, haue percase some fortunes in store, to make them as glorious in such seruices, as any that euer trauailed.

Treasures gotten from such ambitious and maleuolent people, are laudable, and magnifie the state of our kingdomes. Such verely were the spoiles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which <hi>Lucius Mummius</hi> (Collegue in Censorship to <hi>Paulus Aemylius</hi> aforesaid) brought from the state of a most opulent and braue citie: by which atchieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Cicero</hi> noteth in his Offices, that <hi>Mummius</hi> was not a penny the wealthier in his owne priuate purse than before. Adde hereunto, not vnlike in magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, though their fortunes were vnequall, the condition of that sometimes right noble and vnfortunate Lord of good memorie, <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of Essex, after his expedition to Cales: By which example in himselfe hee made knowne to the couetous captaines of his time, and vnto those which had heard of his victories, that true glorie was meerely the subiect and substance of his seruice, which hee shared with his countrey: treasure the meede of his militarie men, which hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> magnificently distributed amongst them. And certainely, there is not any thing which more to life representeth the noble conditions and natures of gallant soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in highest militarie reputation, than either their great victories and spoyles, or their calamities and disfortunes: for the bearing of themselues equall, and the same in both extremities, without insolence or abiection, clearely manifesteth to the world their vertues.

            <p>This Office amongst diuerse otherwayes to weaken it, is laid open to those massie charges which the prince vndergoeth in his warres: and from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereof all inferiour Treasurers of armies, garrisons, nauies and prouinces, with such like, are continually serued.

            <p>A curious eye with vigilant regard must bee bent vpon the Collectors, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, Auditors, and other inferior ministers belonging to this office; least in exactions, or by fraudulent deuises they satisfie there priuate auarice with a kind of extortion or crueltie. For auarice is an inordinate lust of hauing, whose appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is infinite, whose acquisition immoderate, whose possession vnlawfull, whereby the prince vndoubtedly may bee brought into daunger. It is like that <hi>Hydra</hi> which Poets talke of, that though the stroke of Iustice execute vpon it continually; yet will it miraculously reuiue againe: it forceth not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the lightening, thunder or thunderbolts of the law prouided against it. <hi>Salust</hi> describeth it a beast <hi>rauenous, cruell, and intollerable: where it haunteth, huge Cities, Fields, Churches, and Houses are laid wast: Heauen and Earth prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingled; Armies and strong wals cannot restraine the violence thereof: It spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all mortall people of good Report, Modestie, Children, Nation &amp; Parents, &amp;c.</hi> So doth this brightnesse of gold bleare mens outward sences, so fuming in their heads, and fastened in their hearts, that they feare not any mischiefe which can accompanie Lucre. Such wicked, vniust, and rauenous officers, eating the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as bread, are to be squeezed like sponges full of water. Great caution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be vsed against the violence of officers in such extortion, least the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> prince after some few yeares patience of the people, vpon new grieuances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come odious: which king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight in the second yeare of his raigne did most politickely prouide, in his proceedings against Sir <hi>Richard Emson</hi> and M. <hi>Dudley,</hi> late inward and of counsell in such cases vnto his sage father, king <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth. By good example of whose punishment others might vpon the like inconueniences suffer. For if the people find not redresse vpon their complaints, then will they rise (as at that time it was feared) in open hostilitie: which if the blood of those extorting officers can expiate without some humane slaughter sacrificed to tenne hundred scpulchers, then is it happie: but such generall hurts haue commonly no compensation, without a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
            </p>
            <p>The peoples payments ought so to be disposed therefore, that all men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their faculties, by due discretion of good and honest sworne officers in euery shire or prouince, may take such reasonable dayes, and times of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment limited, as they may without any grudging or disease contribute heartely. Moreouer, that such (as are in speciall affaires of their prince, and for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth employed; hauing by such occasions largely spent of their owne priuate for the common good, as euery good man will in such cases) bee for examples sake, for the good encouragement of others, precisely exempted from all kind of burthens and impositions. Also such as haue formerly done much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> grace and honour to their countries and princes (if they be not at that time so high in blood, that they may well away with phlebotomie) should bee graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously spared; according to the French order: for all courtiers and seruants, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant vpon the kings person in his house, are (by the ciuile lawes of Fraunce) <note place="margin">Barth.

and impositions whatsoeuer, which others are tied vnto: likewise in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the times of warre, from any burthen of receiuing, quartering, and billet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of souldiors. Obseruation (concerning these collectors and ministers before named) dependeth vpon the chusing and displacing of Officers either iust or corrupt. First, the choice of such ministers is made out of men, honest, stayed, and well approoued for such a purpose; bad Officers which did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort or vnlawfully compasse, being with losse of their places and possessions punished.</p>
            <p>Dispensation of these tributes and subsidies must bee to the generall, and not any particular vse: for no man will sticke at a little charges employed to publicke behoofe, if it once appeare, that the prince doe not consume his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> treasure in vnnecessarie cost and riot; but keepe a moderation with decencie, which (albeit the vulgar do not generally marke: for they respect onely the princes proper faculties and reuenewes (which ought to be by the treasurers concealed so much as may bee) yet certaine captious and dangerous heads, full of quarrels and aduantages; such as are of fierie spirits, coueting innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which commonly lead the blind and abused vulgar into dangerous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) will narrowly sift and make a breach into the common peace, vnder the pretext of taxes and impositions, as hath beene found in certaine commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the dayes of king <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and king <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther princes, vpon the like occasions. Such gettings therfore as proceed from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the subiects beneuolence, must bee sparingly spent and husbanded: and so should the Treasurers beare themselues in that Office, as stewards of other mens goods, and not of their owne.</p>
            <p>That most prudent and worthy Lord Treasurer <hi>William Cecill</hi> goodly well approued ouer all causes, and in all businesse either publike or priuate, during the late and most deare mirrour of good gouernment, Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of most renowmed and euerliuing memorie, did leaue behind him a liuely pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and precedent of his singular care and excellent wisedome, to the great encrease of that stocke, committed then to his charge, as may serue euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly to them which yet are or euer may be credited with that office, to get <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and maintaine eternall reputation. The generall good opinion and report of him after his death in the mouths of all good men, may stirre vp his successours in that place truely to resemble his vertues and integritie.</p>
            <p>The treasure therefore may not bee wilfully wasted or exhausted for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of any prince in his priuate prodigalitie. <hi>Vera enim &amp; simplex via</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Oratio Philippi in Senat. ex Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust.</note> 
               <hi>est, magnitudinem animi in addendo, non demendo reipublica ostendere.</hi> For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of lauish humours and exorbitate affections, thinke not that there is any true fruition of treasure without profusion. Diue deepe therefore into the bottomelesse danger thereof by manifold and most manifest example and obseruation, as in <hi>Archigallo</hi> king of the Brittaines, who was deposed by the people for his extortion, after hee had raigned fiue yeares, and then vpon his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> reformation restored. And amongst diuers vnaduised princes consider, that it was not the least cause of decay to <hi>Edward</hi> of Carnaruan, king of England, <note place="margin">Edw. 2.</note> when hee by such meanes lost the loue of his commons, by listening vnto flatterers, and wilfully robbed himselfe of the fealtie of his nobles, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7338:15"/>
his sepulchre for other matters more securely. Men of such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> qualitie, which extort much, as if they could not keepe any thing, but that which is taken with a violent extortion, are in themselues miserably poore.</p>
            <p>From hence likewise brauncheth another speciall rule of moderation, that no leuies surmount the princes occasions: for if it tend not to the subiects great benefit, being very necessarily dispensed, it dishonoureth any Soueraigne to straine them in so small a matter. And such impositions must also be sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that the people grow not wearie with them, being fashioned more or lesse according to their plentie or pouertie: for such princes are haunted with the furies of a lamentable infamie, whose treasuries deuour the subiects la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and neuer rest satisfied with bloodie booties. Wee may reade likewise in the French Chronicles, that those impositions which <hi>Philip le beau</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, kings of that realme, had set vpon the wines and salt, caused the men of Gascoyne and others in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, king of Fraunce, to rebell, which was a great preiudice and danger vnto that state, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit now by custome a speciall part of that crownes reuenewes (at which no man, by reason of the long continuance in these latter times, repineth, but willingly submitteth himselfe to the burthen) dependeth vpon them and the like Monopolies. Good princes also will take heed of that pernicious desire, which in prosperitie filleth vp the still gaping mouths and purses of parasiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> flatterers, and temporizing Sycophants: howbeit some liued in the late raigne of good Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which abusing her high grace, extended towards them out of her meere royall nature, compassed such things as were both preiudicall to her reputation, and to the Commonwealth in some sort: such persons as these cannot be truely called seruants, but vnto their owne intollerable affections; neither will I giue instance of them, namely, being so generally knowne, and fresh in our memories; as also for many more reasons of modestie which inhibite it. It is therefore most certaine, that all newly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nised monopolies vsurping vpon the subiects trades and trauels, are odious, and commonly daungerous: such as amongst other <hi>Vespasian</hi> tooke of <hi>Vryne,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> who (because his sonne <hi>Titus</hi> seemed to mislike therof) told him, that though the subiect was vnsauourie, yet the accident was sweet. And what a beastly Monopolie or monthly tribute is that, which is at this day taken into the Popes treasuries in Rome and at Bologna, from those curtisans and whores, which by profession prostitute their bodies for gaine. Which the very Gentils and Atheists as <hi>Lampridius</hi> writeth in his Histories, did prohibite, That any tributes issuing from harlots or bauds, should bee receiued into the sacred Treasuries, but reserued in another place for the disposition of the <hi>Ediles Curules</hi> towards the furnishing and setting forth of publicke playes and showes, as also to the reparation and mending of bridges, ports, and high <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> wayes for the cities Commonwealth. Likewise wee find, that <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi> taxed all sorts of artificers, drapers, glasiers, skinners, masons, plaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, shoomakers, with such like, in a moderate order; the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire being then growne vp to that height, which could not easily permit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection or mutinies. Onely this according truely with the state of princes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7338:15"/>
in such cases, <hi>Vectigal optimum est parsimonia:</hi> for by beeing frugall of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> owne, he winneth the loue and fauor of his people in sparing of them. <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Nero,</hi> thought his tyrannies and oppressions of the people had purchased him a generall and mortall hatred amongst them: yet deuised this one way, <hi>(Quasi pulcherrimum donum generi mortalium daturus)</hi> to free the Romanes <note place="margin">Cor.

And certaine it is, (if there bee many Monopolies in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) that diuers good princes will either remit or diminish them; which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>Charles</hi> the eight of Fraunce (as <hi>Lupanus</hi> writeth) had done, but that death o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise preuented his beneficence. Howbeit, in all affaires concerning the conseruation or amplification of any Commonwealth: <hi>Regis Aerarium est</hi>

Such must therefore be chosen, as will not either in malice or fauour oppresse or succour. For being ordinarily vexed at inequalitie, the people naturally will grow malicious, measuring their losses with other mens gaines: And hence is it, that a more diligent circumspection is required in them which haue that charge in hand.

By which order, according to precise iudgement and discretion, all tributes are by due proportion leuied, and people assessed. It behooueth them therefore in their priuat consciences first to compare their own particular estates, together with the Commonwealth in all equitie, appointing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners as censors, which can discerne and take notice of the peoples off-spring, ages, families, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance euery third or fift yere.

Hee may not make the people fearefull of his liberalitie with grieuous and vnneedfull impositions; but onely sparing his owne, vsing their beneuolences to their generall comfort, with a couetous kind of liberalitie: which beeing with good cunning and discretion exercised, the people will with all honour to the prince embrace it louingly: for he which is vertuously liberall, according to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> strict conscience, shall neuer bee commended nor honoured for it: because that is not vulgarly tearmed liberalitie in princes, which walloweth not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: a course euery way pernicious to the soueraigne and subiect: first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioning a priuate pouertie to the prince; to the subiect then in grieuous and insupportable supplies for maintenance of that iolitie; forcing them to diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and himselfe to shame and rapacitie. And I am verely persuaded, that all prodigall persons are of a fierce and turbulent spirit, during that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous tempest, readier (when want approcheth vpon their imprudence) by most wicked meanes to maintaine that riot, than to fall vnto some honest and meane course of quiet liuing, as many times when I consider hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to me liuely by good example; which also consenteth with that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Salust: Annius ferox praua via ingressus (vbi consueta non suppetunt)</hi>

What must he therefore doe to maintaine a good opinion of that vertue without perill? First, let him not fret in wardly, though he be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned of parsimonie, so close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly smothering auarice, that he be not reputed couetous: for admit that attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute be blacke stone, yet is the subiect thereof bright gold: for a prince can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make safe vse of liberalitie, neither hold his owne sure without danger. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> But of these two difficult choices a wise prince will affect parsimonie, for growing rich with sparing hee shall be magnified amongst forrainers; which will therefore stand in feare of his puissance: and at home with his owne people, for that in sparing his treasure, the subiects liuings are likewise spared: which forbearance they willingly tearme an honest and vertuous liberalitie. Such opinion did <hi>Titus Flaminius</hi> purchase amongst the Greekes, which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ouerthrow of king <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon, enfranchised all the cities of Greece from tributes by publicke proclamations in euery place.

Howbeit, if princes haue laid a firme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> foundation, how they may through high liberalitie multiplie dominion, then will not they commonly spare at any cost: yea people naturally breath and hunt after the fortunes of magnificent princes: But hauing once firmely effected their purpose, their purchase is by little and little as warily cherished. Neither is the course of their gouernment in any iot impeached, but magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

thereby. To princes militant also profuse liberalitie much auaileth, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they can with hostile spoyles encourage their souldiors, taking examples by <hi>Cyrus, Caesar, Alexander:</hi> for that both retaineth and augmenteth their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if the generall burthen bee not carried out of their owne cofers. Let this onely be considered of prodigalitie; That it is a great <hi>vessell bottomelesse, a big chest locklesse, a vaine profusion carelesse.</hi> And if I should paint that strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to life, I would place her in great and iolly pompe, variably plumed, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching betwixt a notable foole, and a singular braggart, seruing for two villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous weake supporters: and seconded at an ynch also by two forlorneslaues; one of them a miserable begger, and the other an vnpittied penetentiarie. Me seemeth it a fit comparison betwixt the viper and princely prodigalitie: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for that infinit spawne which is bred of this serpent (being composed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat affections, intemperat appetites, base flatterers, and of the most conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous off all and poison of all princes courts) eate out the bowels of the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the verie time of their birth, which perisheth by them that were cherished by her. These young viprous vices liuely represent ingratitude, to which all of them be subiect that are fostered by prodigalitie. These are those hounds which mythologically deuoured <hi>Actaeon,</hi> when after the murtherous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and concupiscence of his eyes and flesh, he was transformed into a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beast, excellently shadowing that pusillanimitie which through excesse of sensualitie depriue him of a reasonable creatures shape and faculties, leauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him a lamentable spoile to those deerest and most inward enemies, his owne affections. Yet for as much as I run here into some morall considerations, me seemeth it should now be verie fitting to make some demonstration of those ethicall parts that are in Temperance, by which the treasures of all wise prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and people ought to be restrained and gouerned.</p>
            <p>Temperance therefore is a vertue which subiecteth pleasures to the yoke of reason, limiting all things within moderation: <hi>Cicero</hi> defineth it to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and moderat domination of reason, restraining vs from lusts, and from other violent imperfections of the mind. <hi>Plato</hi> with <hi>Aristotle</hi> consenteth, that Temperance is most speciously seene in passing ouer, and as it were fearefully, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but more painefully poasting away from all voluptuous appetites: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they tearme it <hi>Sophrosune,</hi> being the conseruator of prudence, signifying a moderation or frugalitie: for if fleshly concupiscence or inordinate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure subiect the noble part of man, then will they forceably banish all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and moderation, manacling and fettering him within the mazie wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of secure sensualitie: so that neither foot nor hand shall haue power to discharge their naturall functions in any due proportion, but are sopped and steeped in the dregs of all riot and profusion, which dragge along with them (as I sayd before) rapacitie, shame, and beggerie. Wise princes and potentates therefore, to whom God hath imparted treasures in abundance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ought with all vehement intention to ponder, how dangerous intoxicating a poyson this is, because vnto them more than to others, such momentanie furies misguisedly masking in the falsed habiliments of sweet comfort and contentment, like enchauntresses, oft and many times appeare. For as much therefore as pleasures either proceed from a naturall instinct, being corporall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7338:17"/>
and common to all creatures hauing life, or from some inwardly conceiued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> opinion: of which, some haue reference to good and honest purposes, which are meerely directed by the rule of temperance; others are extreamely bad besotted and nuzzled in brutish sence: all wise and perfect princes will so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate their owne appetites, freeing them from all exorbitat and luxurious pleasures, as may both encrease their honor, health, wealth, and empire. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, <hi>Seneca</hi> writ, That there be delights with which temperance dispenseth, &amp; others also which she doth hate and banish: considering therefore how nature is nourished and supplied with a little, and that temperance by the direction of reason prescribeth a necessitie to nature, that it may liue within a mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: these pleasures of excesse in diet, ornaments, and of all luxurious appetites, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> are ascribed to the bodie Other delights, as when a man is arrogant &amp; opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue, or infected with a vaine selfe dotage, or when he libidinously prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his owne fantasies, oppressing his pure reason with the foggie mists of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenciousnesse, are well appropriated to the mind. <hi>Cicero</hi> diuideth temperance into three parts: first into Continence, by which desire is restrained vnder the gouernment of counsell, and which in all corporall diet &amp; ornament keepeth a meane. Vnto which Abstinence is annexed as a part thereof, &amp; manifested in binding mens hands from rapine and theft: next into Clemencie, which is a mentall temperance, when there is power and sufficient meanes to punish and reuenge, or rather (as <hi>Seneca</hi> tearmeth it) a lenitie discending from the superior <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to the inferior in cases of punishment. Mercy (being the mother of gentlenesse and humanitie, highly pleasant in the most high presence of God) is adiunct to clemencie: and thirdly vnto modestie, which (as <hi>Cicero</hi> defineth) is a <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent moderation or cohibition of lusts, mouing and reuelling in the mind.</hi> He likewise sayth, That honest modestie through shamefastnesse doth retaine a noble and <note place="margin">Lib. 3. ad Heren.</note> constant authoritie. Adiunct to this is the feare of shame or disgrace, as by the <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de innent.</note> philosophicall definition of <hi>Verecundia</hi> should appeare, which <hi>Tully</hi> semblably calleth ingenious timiditie, with a reuerence expressed vnto men: whereas by the naturall inclination and propertie thereof it will not hurt any man; but is that true comelinesse or decencie which the Philosophers call <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> manifested in temperate and well affected bodies, when they bee suddenly prouoked, commoued, or stirred vp with some vndecent or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumelious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, speech, or behauiour, in others repugnant to their ingenious and toward natures, which moueth in them a sudden and well beseeming blush presented from a certaine feare of shame, disgrace or turpitude, being the very badge of honestie, which is dispersed &amp; opened by the force of their modest spirits. And hence is it that <hi>Plato</hi> in his dialogue of temperance citeth or faineth a saying of <hi>Critias</hi> to <hi>Charmides,</hi> a beautifull young man disputing with him concerning a medicine or charme for the headach, That te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance would cure that disease, with all grieuances of the body likewise: and dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of <hi>Charmides,</hi> whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> he were possessed of that medicine, <hi>Plato</hi> faineth, <hi>Genas eius rubore suffusas gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> specie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>disse, pudore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> etenim eam atate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> decuisse.</hi> This affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> albeit Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers <note place="margin">Plato. lib. 20.

the perturbations and motions of the mind, by the retaining of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or harmonie, quieting and calming all humane actions, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnfit or immodest be done or spoken: nothing in hatred, malice, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lust, ambition, arrogancie, or other such violent passions and distractions of the spirit.</p>
            <p>The parts of modestie be lowlinesse or humilitie; so forceably depressing insolence, that by how much the more worthie men bee, so much the more humble they may shew themselues. Which lesson our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to learne of him, considering, that in vs, as of our selues, nothing can be decent or commendable, but onely proceeding from the precious gift of God. This lesson teacheth vs the fruition of that Oracle, <hi>Nosce teipsum;</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when a man doth not attribute any goodnesse to himselfe, but acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that hee receiued the same out of the fountaine of all bountic from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue.</p>
            <p>The second part of modestie should seeme to be the desire to learne and be taught: which is seene in men, that recognizing their ignorance, are studious and desirous of instruction.</p>
            <p>The third part of modestie doth speciously declare it selfe in pleasantnesse of speech, alacritie, comitie, and affabilitie. This ought to bee well knowne and practised by wise courtiers: for these qualities grace them amongst per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the best qualitie: And this is reputed a kind of moderate and well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vrbanitie; when in speech and answeres men auoid bitternesse, and salt taunting, hardly set on; and more than indifferently poudered, in respect of the times, places, and persons. Let them therefore alwayes obserue a certaine honest moderation, delaying, or rather perfectly purging all the mentall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations with a pleasant medicine of words and cheerefulnesse. This ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should be the scope of all speech: In serious matters to shew seueritie; in pleasant discourses festiuitie; regarding, that our tongues bewray not any corruption of manners, which staine is specially noted in those that either contumeliously, ridiculously, slaunderously, seuerely, or raylingly back-bite any persons. Likewise it is as vndecent and intemperate, that any man should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> praise himselfe; which as a foolish trumpet soundeth out his owne disgrace and folly to wise men.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last part is moderation in apparrell, and in other corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ornaments; being the mediocritie betwixt riotous curiositie and slouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: shewing, that all garments should be neat fit for the body, and agreeable to the sex which should weare them: in worth and fashion correspondent to the state, substance, age, place, time, birth, and honest custome of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which vse them. To conclude therefore I say, that Temperance is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, than which nothing is more powerfull, towards the repressing of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nothing more fit for the good composition and confirmation of mens manners, nothing more effectuall towards the attainement of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that can either be deuised or spoken: and certainely, there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing good in the whole course of mans life, which may not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced vnto Temperance, as to the centre or spring of humane happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:7338:18"/>
It followeth needfully, that I speake somewhat of intemperance, and of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the oppositions to these foresaid good parts. Intemperance therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Cicero,</hi> is such a kind of obedience vnto lusts, meerely repugnant to <note place="margin">Lib. 3.

By violence of the first, men vnreasonably gallop into the perillous gulfe of pleasures, by spurring vpon their libidinous appetites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason: That other, which is called <gap reason="foreign">

Of which temper wee shall not in this our age find many; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> howbeit, certaine auaricious misers (which haue no sence nor feeling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly) doe some deale encline to that humour. This is a most pernicious disease of the mind, noysome to him that is so affected, and most daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous vnto them that conuerse with people of that strange disposition. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence being opposite to the first part of temperance, is seene in rior, luxurie, and drunkennesse: vpon which, infinite sorts of diseases are bred; blunting the sharpenesse of reason, and dulling the wits edge; making persons altogether vnfit for the performance of any noble Offices. And often haue I wondered, that our nation breathing in such a temperate climate, should so much encline to that Dutch distemperature of drunkennesse, which <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> tearmeth <hi>Voluntariam insaniam.</hi> For thereby nature is weakened and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the keene edge of the best vnderstanding rebated, wrath without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son kindled, lust without measure incensed, secrets of greatest moment dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed, words to particular persons, and sometimes to the Commonwealth, offensiue vttered. Wonder it is therefore, why men should voluntarily drowne themselues in excesse; a little is comfortable and that Prouerbe, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid nimis,</hi> very medicinable, if it can be willingly disgested. Rapacitie being adiunct to incontinence, hurteth many, proceeding from riot and immeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable expence: when princes and noble persons impose grieuous burthens vpon their subiects and tenants, to maintaine that excesse; or when they put <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> cruell and vniust meanes in execution, to take away mens goods by strong hand or hypocriticall violence vnder the robe of iustice. Against gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, being the second part of temperance, the deuouring fire, vengeance, or crueltic, standeth opposite: Adiunct thereto, mercilesse, or (as it were) stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led immanitie. Such are those which tyrannize ouer captiues, persons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated; nay, such will not spare the dead, but like wilde beastes feede vpon them with the fangues of malicious and venemous rancour.</p>
            <p>Opposite to mercie (which is the adiunct of Clemencie) standeth lenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; or foolish pitie, being the part of a blockish magistrate, as I will partly note in the Morals of my third booke. But crueltie doth not only resist tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> &amp; iustice, but fortitude also, which I shall also manifest in the Morals of my fourth booke.</p>
            <p>Against modestie (which is the third and last part of temperance) contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maciously stand impudencie, being a most detestable vice in the presence of God, or of all good men, which contemneth or neglecteth all decencie, with

honestie of life, opening a large and easie way to vicious conuersation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> void of all feare and shame. Also Pride and Arrogancie (which withstand humiliation) is another opposite rotten member; whereby men in a blind loue of themselues imagine more excellent parts and perfections contained in them than are, and arrogating vertues beyond their apprehension and practise: This may be called a vaine, insolent, and foolish ostentation: a vice ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Carelesnesse and negligence likewise, beeing the qualities of sluggish dolts, and persons assotted with curiositie, (which is the inordinate dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or desire to learne arts vnprofitable, euill, and vnnecessarie) stand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> opposed vnto the true studies of learning: semblably, scurulous prating, and vnsauourie girding, (such as parasites, stage-players, and other giddie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Mimickes vse, according vnto the opinion of <hi>Aristotle)</hi> opposite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Lib. 2. &amp; 4. ad N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The fourth and last extreame of Modestie doth consist in excesse of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> garments, and other ornaments of the bodie, when they bee made onely for vaine ostentation of the mind: which hath beene a notable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, wherewith all our English men, more than any nation of the world, haue beene shamefully branded amongst forrenners for their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised fashions, and sumpteous habiliments beyond the bounds of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, moderation, or habilitie: some women after a preposterous fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, attired like men in dubblets; and some men like women in pettie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coates. This excesse hath so generally dispersed it selfe in our nation, that by their exterior new-fangled robes the wisest of our aduersaries or emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators in forraine parts haue past their iudgements of our giddie minds and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> vnconstant behauiours, inwardly saying, That in wearing Dutch hats with French feathers, French dubblets and colletts after the custome of Spaine, Spanish hose, and rapiers of Valentia, Turkish coates, Italian cloakes, and perfumes, with such like; wee likewise had stolne the faults and excesses of those countreyes which wee did imitate naturally. Besides, what a shame was it for vs to bee noted with this exorbitate excesse, that base tailliers, and others which worke as hirelings, aspiring to that abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vndecent singularitie, should equall themselues in the cost and fashion of their attire, with some of the greatest Barons in this land: a fault not to bee imputed vnto the lawes, for those are precise and strict in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> such comely considerations; but in the dissolute and intemperate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people, which in steed of a little libertie, make a licence at large, tyrannizing vpon the princes gentle disposition and lenitie. Hence was it, that the nobilitie to distinguish themselues by this outward apport of their degrees and riches from the rascall rabble of base ruffians, were driuen to most extreame charge, that they might make a difference of themselues from them equiualent in proportion. Which course had the prince then kept, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable in her state abuse some Ladies and others in the like analogie: then might shee with ease haue consumed the vnspeakeable masse of Treasure. By this meane the substance of other tailliers, craftsmen, and mechanicall fellows <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> was dayly more encreased, and the fortunes of our gentlemen exhausted. Which leprosie did in short time so spread itselfe through this nation that diuers liuings of auntient demesne and inheritance which haue continued in succession from manic grandfathers of one race did hang in tailliers shops and were piled vp in the Persian and Spanish merchants coffers. This emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and excesse hauing further preuailed, grew to such outrage, that when proper maintenance fayled in some to support such riot, they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently or secretly tooke from others to supply the same: which hath beene the demolition and confusion of many noble families and persons, lately great in worldly reputation: others in a priuate want, purchased by their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> owne intollerable profusion, haue perished in their pestilent practises, tending to the common spoyle, for satisfaction of their insatiable appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites: <hi>Semper etenim in ciuitate qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

student.</hi> This profusion therefore next to the vice of gluttonous surfeit, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ought principally to bee restrained by wise and moderate princes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen: for it drayneth their treasure, enfeebling that true heroicall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their minds, either adding to their pride (vnto which people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly that delight in such gay things, are most subiect) or mollifying and deprauing their liberall natures and conditions with lust and ouer-delicat effeminacie.</p>
            <p>But thus much in breefe as I could, expressing the adiuncts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Temperance, and of her opposites, subalternately respecting the purse: now somewhat concerning the beneficence and liberalitie which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitteth potentates. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>It is not thought fit, that princes should precisely stand at vtterance with true liberalitie beeing of it selfe meerely vertuous: but that they shunne a generall largesse or profusion rather, which most Kings affect most in the beginning of their reignes, considering that there are many (whose seruices hauing long expected recompence) which should bee seasoned and encouraged in their faithfulnesse and honesties with some secret taste of royall Munificence.</p>
            <p>This consideration in some proceedeth out of a magnificent heart, most liberally garnished with true vertues; and in others, from ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a vaineglorious desire of somewhat more than ordinarie, cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly couched in their owne heads. Princes therefore shall so much, or more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> bee warned and take heede of this excesse then of auarice after a sort, least by such bestowing, the force of beneficence be deminished according to <hi>Cicero</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Officiorum 2.</note> 
               <hi>Stultum est quod libentèr facias, curare vt id diutiùs facere non possis,</hi> For how can a man properly, tearme that a benefite bestowed which is a meere mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the bestower; and hence is that Prouerbe of <hi>Hunius</hi> fitted to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>Benefacta malelocata malefacta arbitror.</hi> Yet if God haue so prouided that a Prince must surely fall into the choise of those two damnable extreames (both which all Princes should hold detestable as snakes) of the two mischiefes, I would hee rather did encline to couetise: for wealth giueth some shaddow to shame: albeit our wise men and all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> consent that it is dishonestie; but after rapacitie, which is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out of the putrifaction of prodigalitie, ragged infamie doth attend with an almes basket. Neither is it entended, that princes should tie such a Gordian knot vpon their purse, as nothing may without <hi>Alexanders</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and necessitie loose the same, but that they may with moderation and vpon good cause exceede rather in liberalitie: which the seldomer vsed, may be the richer when it happeneth: and if it come often, then so much the shorter and sweeter.</p>
            <p>There is another fashion of Liberalitie peculiar to princes, which may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> bee tearmed a beneficence: and this braunch of vertue graffed, is in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ry top of iustice: for in all Common-weales, of the soundest instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are alwayes some capitall crimes and forfeitures, out of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7338:20"/>
which a wise prince in his iustice, may by good discretion very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> giue a pleasing tast of his liberalitie to persons vertuous and of desert, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their qualities, that good men may liue by the fall of euill mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and not that bad people may be made worse by the spoyles of honest men, vnto whome the dignities and possessions of such as are worthely rooted out for their wickednesse, may be collated. By which kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence he greatly magnifieth himselfe. First, in beeing honoured for his iustice against offendours: secondly, by preferring persons noted for their worthinesse; thirdly, with his care had of the Commonwealth, which hee ciuilizeth and secureth by the extirpation of such malefactors: fourthly, through giuing heart and courage to men of qualitie, so to demeine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> by profitable studies and vertuous liuing, that they may stand in the like grace: fifthly, by taking away from the people all opinion of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse in himselfe, when hee reserueth not any benefite to his priuate vse, but is seene to doe it in iustice, without any desire of hauing. Lastly, by not extenuating his proper faculties in such bestowing. Thus shall others bee satisfied, his owne power strengthened, and his priuate treasure spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Which kind of beneficence, king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight vsed (when the Chaunteries and religious houses, to the value of two hundred pounds yearely, and vnder, with all lands and goods belonging them, were by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment graunted vnto him in the seuen and twentieth yeare of his raigne) by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> bestowing those lands vpon the speciall gentlemen in euery Shire, where they were dissolued, more manifesting a good conscience, than any coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse in the cause. And hence was it, that the commotions in <hi>Lincolne Shire, Yorke Shire,</hi> and in other parts of this Realme, vnder the colour of a dislike, vpon a new size of Subsidie to be leuied, were so quickly quieted by the gentlemen, principall heads in those disturbed parts, whose very counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance amated the seditious commons, which once and againe stirred to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance and subuersion of the present quiet; beeing (as it was thought) first kindled at the fire, which M. <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> then Lord priuie Seale, and Vicegerent generall of the Spiritualties, brought with him, to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> desolate those houses, and all other Abbeyes, which were soone after dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued.</p>
            <p>For Treasures of princes, noble men, and priuate persons, by their gifts to gaine a good opinion amongst good men of their true liberalitie, these three cautions are required: First, a respect vnto the time; secondly, to the quantitie; thirdly, to the person: when, how much, and vpon whome they will bestow: the time limitted, when it may stand them in most steed which bee rewarded, not preiudicing others to maintaine the same, according to the saying of <hi>Cicero, Ab hoc genere largitionis, vt alijs detur alijs auferatur abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt ij qui rempub, tuebuntur:</hi> As in graunting of Monopolies to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of some one man, by the preiudicing of a multitude, which is very dangerous: as also when one rich marchant is suffered to ingrosse some one whole commoditie into his owne hands. As it is written of a craftie <hi>Syci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> who with money that was none of his owne, but lent vnto him as in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7338:20"/>
trust to bee restored, vpon demaund bought all the yron out of the yron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> shops in <hi>Syracusae:</hi> and when marchants had from diuers places repaired to that citie, this Ingrosser furnished them with that commoditie, not greatly raising the price thereof: yet so, that for the disbursement of fiftie talents hee gayned an hundred; which was a double vse: for a Talent <hi>Atticke</hi> amounted to sixe hundred crownes: in so much, as by bestowing thirtie thousand crownes, he gained cleere threescore thousand, and had a quicke returne of his money. But the bruit hereof beeing brought vnto the tyrant <hi>Dionysius;</hi> albeit the money was not taken from him, (which many miserable tyrants would haue done) yet was hee banished from <hi>Syracusae.</hi> Which punishment was so much the lesse, by how much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the more that tyrant was taught by the like precedent.</p>
            <p>These &amp; such like Monopolies (where many businesses are handled for the Commonwealth) are onely fit for princes, and not to be diuolued or vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly bestowed vpon marchants or other subiects: forsomuch as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a generall malice of the people for a priuat mans thankes vnto the prince: and some princes get not so much as thankes. The quantitie likewise ought to be measured by the rule of their owne faculties which bestow them: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vpon whome it is bestowed respected according to their worth and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, taking good heed that they benefit not their friends by preiudicing stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or oppresse any to maintaine the report of their liberalitie, breaking that bubble of vaine glorie soone puft vp with emptinesse, which allureth babes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and fooles into the bottomlesse waues of confusion: <hi>Suum namque cuique in</hi>

            <p>There is likewise a kind of Liberalitie most expedient, which <hi>Cicero</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth beneficence; being as it were <hi>a willing habite, or inclination, moouing men to doe good.</hi> This goodnesse hee defineth by the similitude of them which will not restraine the course of a riuer freely running, as not maliciously crossing anothers preferment, when it withdraweth not one mite from their owne, but further, or aduaunce it rather. The contrarie to which is very rife in euery princes court at this day. Likewise it is held a kind of Liberalitie, to giue sound and honest counsell from a well-willing heart to the best of their cunning, vnto such as will consult with them: this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> is a Liberalitie from a faithfull Counsellour, peculiar vnto his prince and countrey: which faithfulnesse ought mutually to bee recompenced vnto him by the prince with honour and dignities: for wee read it in the Psalmes of that blessed Prophet: <hi>Dilige bonum servum vt animam tuam, &amp; tracta cum vt fratrem tuum.</hi> Good Princes therefore will shew their beneficence vnto good Counsellors, being absent, present, aliue, or dead: euen in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing their children to those offices after them, if they bee found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie. Which truly royall beneficence hath woon so many good counsellours hearts, that not onely they haue left all their lands and possessions at their death vnto the king; but some of them haue most ioyfully sacrificed their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> liues for his safetie. The third strayne of beneficence, is by similitude of him that giueth light vnto the torch of another from his owne: for this is a neighbourly beneficence, not hindering his owne, in len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding helpe vnto friendes and countreymen. Which kinde of honest

lending and dutifull repayment is very needfull and commodious, being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a true vertuous braunch of Liberalitie, as is witnessed by that royall Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>Vir iustus liberalis est &amp; mutuum dat;</hi> declaring, that lending is a member of Liberalitie; which vndoubtedly tendeth to the conseruation of humane societie.</p>

If therefore the prince haue this principall gift, then is hee the Sunne to those starres of his Counsell, which giue a reasonable light from his influence; being a sweet perfection of goodnesse in any Commonwealth. And if his Counsellours haue that diuine spirit of Sapience in themselues by Gods ordinance, for the weale of his people, where the prince hath this second facultie, to be directed or perswaded by them; yet is that notwithstanding a strong, sufficient, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> good state: But if both the Prince and his Counsell hold the substance of all good wisedome in themselues wisely to consult and direct, being willing also to be counselled and directed in wisedome, without doubt that dominion will flourish and amplifie.

            <p>Them therfore that serue in such Office, it behoueth to be very well skilled in princely cunning being with diligence employed in affaires of state, and politicke matters, narrowly respecting gouernment. This Counsell especially conuerseth in ciuile causes; as in punishing of Rulers, Deputies, Iustices of peace, Generals of armies, Coronels, priuat Captaines, inferior Counsellors of the prince ciuile or martiall, concerning their iust dealing or iniquitie in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Offices.

This Counsell likewise prouideth, that there be no falshood in paying of wages and prouision for victuall vsed by the treasurers &amp; prouant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> masters in campe or garrison.

Those secrets of a State, which commonly fore beyond the vulgar appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> beeing certaine rules, or as it were cabals of glorious gouernment and successe both in peace and warre (apprehensible to few secret Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors in some Commonweales, which either languish or wax vnfortunate) are locked vp in foure generall rules. First, in the congregation of wise magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, including the prinat Counsell. These vpon importune causes in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of highest consequence (that cannot otherwise bee remedied, but by meanes most necessarie to bee concealed) knit vp the prudence of their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in sinuous knots and serpentine wreathes of mysticall and intricate meanes, and instruments, fetching in their curious machinations and denises with bait, hooke, and line, for any graue purpose beyond ordinarie reason. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> The second is in the maiestie of State, which includeth euery prince his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate power with the strength of his wisedome and fortitude, in allies, monies, confederates, inuasions and euasions, in all glorious hazards and aduentures. In seeking certainely to learne out those mysteries, the vulgar are commonly deceiued: for it is so shadowed, as not all princes are well acquainted with their owne force, and how faire their armes may by meanes sufficiently stretch: onely some few very prudent and industrious Counsellors, of grauest and most iudicious obseruation, are throughly well acquainted withall. The third consisteth in iudgements: wherein vpon the decision and appendance of some weightie matters (respecting the common quiet and securitie by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> mysticall circumstances in handling) strange Oracles, not apprehensible by vulgar sence, are oftentimes closed: as by suffering a mischiefe rather than an inconuenience, and by breaking off a leg or arme, to saue the best ioynt from perishing. The fourth concludeth in the warie leuying of warre, in the skilfull exercising, leading, and encouraging of souldiors vpon seruices vnto them vnknowne, and tending to the most renowne, protection, and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their countrey; which entirely dependeth vpon stratagemes of warre, deuised and executed by the Commaunder his noble and industrious sagacitie and secrecie; and in them many times are the weales and safeties of puissant kings and kingdomes wholly contained. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
            </p>
            <p>In choice of this most honourable Senate it is very needfull, that the prince shew great prudence and discretion: as in that sufficiencie which must serue the mature expedition of all causes committed to the administration therof: so that Election <hi>(being as it were a franke action of the mind, which in choice of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The worthiest choice that a Prince can make for such a Senate, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> out of the true nobilitie, which vnder him should gouerne and amplifie the Commonwealth: I meane principally those that are notable and approoued for their vertues and honour, encountering neerely with the dignities of their blood and families: such as flie not into the palaces of a Commonwealth by

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> In all sorts of cities, the marchandize of honours and rewards which are due to vertue, is most foule and pernicious. For what more dishonour in any state can bee found, than when honours and dignities are vnworthily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed? <hi>Iacet etenim &amp; sordescit reipub gloria cum indignis honores tribuuntur:</hi> For the glory of euery such Commonwealth (where honours are vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ioh.

Such vertuous and worthie Counsellors therefore by the princes sacred discretion (as it is in his Maiesties Realmes of England and Scotland) may be chosen out of those Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Prouinces which bow to his scepter. For if wise men of approoued goodnesse and sufficiencie for that place find themselues and all of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> exempted from this honourable societie, it is vnspeakeable, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously they will stomacke it, thinking not without some ground, that they be not respected but suspected.

And therefore it is held for a certaine truth, That nothing so soone moueth discord, as too much partiall distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of rewards and honours. A prince therefore beeing assisted with Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors chosen out of his owne kingdomes, may better and more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously prouide against any future calamities. My iudgement is slender, but it may be thought how some discontentment vpon this ground, added to the fedicious fire in Ireland, when those stubborne rebels formerly withstood the proceedings of our late Soueraigne and her Deputies with the Counsell esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> that realme. No persons though most prudent (for this is a sure and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> infallible position) being priuately discontented and ambitious, may safely be chosen into the fellowship of any princes priuat Counsell, but the guides and ringleaders of those Irish rebels were alwaies knowne to be discontented inwardly disturbed and ambitious: therefore the state was well handled in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7338:25"/>
that point. To conclude vpon this therefore a prince without great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and principall remedies medicining that daunger, may not make choice of his secret Counsellors out of one kingdome onely, if hee retaine more principalities than one: because in bestowing all fauour or the greatest part thereof vpon one peculiar people, they grow so proud, that their astoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, neighbouring them, stirred vp with indignation, and despiteously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining thereat, with generall maledictions crosse their proceedings: by which meanes commouing sedicious cauils and quarrels against them, they sometimes vnder that abhominable pretext may make a way to diuest their liege Soueraignes, and it hath euer more beene obserued, that the like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are most desperate, ending in much blood and crueltie. This is also most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> certaine, that a better choice may be found amongst many good, than out of a bad multitude. When they therefore which are vertuously affected, see their prince like a true patrone or parent rather to studie their generall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour so much, the more readie will they be to make good remonstrance of their duties and honesties; being a principall meane to draw the worthiest of their Nobles and others to Philosophicall and needfull arts and studies: Neither may this choice bee made out of his owne house or court onely; but by diligent inquisition he may learne which are best and most excellent in all prouinces: them vnder some other pretence the prince may send for, hauing their expences in iourney beneuolently defrayed, and according to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> their sufficiencie for that place proceede in Election. By which kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition the Soueraigne may come to sure knowledge of all the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and worthy persons in his realmes. Such as are not chosen of them that were approued (for peraduenture some one or two may supplie the defect in that Counsell) must be with meeknesse, affabilitie, beneficence, great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for their vertues, and royall encouragement to perseuerance in the same dismissed. Heerein also deliberation is very requisite, a free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and prouision therefore for their securitie should be graunted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, as was the auncient custome against the kings of Egypt after their deaths, according to <hi>Diodorus;</hi> which in open accusation either by word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> or writing can make proofe of their notable vnworthinesse for that Office: <note place="margin">Lib. 2. bib. histor.</note> and if any man scandalously lay some notable crimes vnto their charge, which cannot be prooued; hee which so maliciously woundeth any good mans fame, deserueth in all rigour to bee seuerely punished. Those accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations which are exhibited against any of them, must bee willingly and graciously receiued, heard, and remitted (if it bee requisite) to iust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition and iudgement. This auncient custome was obserued amongst the Romanes, in election of their magistrates, by which their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth gallantly flourished: and when that course declined, their State so much inclined, that it was miserable, and ruinous in short ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e. Not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> much vnlike was that of king <hi>Philip Valoys</hi> called <hi>Le Beau,</hi> who published an Edict, That euerie third yeare inquisition should bee made into the manners, state, and behauiour of the secret Counsellors, administrng in the <note place="margin">Ioh.

In this forme of triall therefore great iudgement and good heed must bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> had to those accusations so preferred, which sometimes like pilles haue their bitternesse fairely gilt and shaddowed, as hath beene manifoldly seene by good experience heretofore. In which case the Prince imitateth S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> not crediting further than his eyes and hands haue seene and felt. For ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Offices are either bestowed vpon men for desert, for fauour, or in respect of their power. He which in this choice hath inspexion onely to the first, sheweth wisedome and vertue: but they that simply standvpon power and fauour, differ little from the touch of tyrannie.</p>
            <p>A fit Counsellor therefore a little after his election should haue adoption by the prince into that societie, before his noble and immediate ministers of Iustice; where, to him must bee shewed, that for his wisedome and honest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> parts, and in regard of the peoples good opinion, attesting his sufficiencie, choice was made of him: which good fame if he would cherish, the glorie should in speciall redound vnto himselfe; whereas otherwise, the neglect thereof would disgrace and deiect him, proposing rewards and punishments suting with his demeanour: by which course the people will be well satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Counsellor tied to care how this honour may be with answerable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie retained, and to knit vp the couenant, his oath being (as <hi>Cicero</hi> tearmeth it) a religious affirmation, must bee ministred vnto him in presence; which will summon his conscience to warie circumspection and faithfulnesse in that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, arming him with honest constancie, when partiall respect of blood or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> friendship shall chalenge him vpon vniust tearmes; by which means he may take honourable exceptions against them. And hence is it that <hi>Salust</hi> sayth, How Counsellors should in their difficult consultations set apart all hatred, friendship, wrath, and mercie. <hi>Haud etenim facile vera prouidet animus vbi illa officiunt: neque quisquam omnium libidini simùl &amp; vsui paruit:</hi> For hardly can the mind foresee the truth where those offend, neither did euer any man become subiect at once to his lust and commoditie.

               <note place="margin">Officiorum 3.</note> 
               <hi>contra rempub. neque contra iusiurandum ac fidem amici sui causa vir bonus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciet:</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>nec si Iudex quidem erit de ipso amico:</hi> A good man will not enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny action either against the Commonwealth, or contrarie to his oath, for any respect of friendship: no, though he were the Iudge in his friends cause. For euery noble magistrat which respecteth honour, will onely doe those things, <hi>Quae salua fide facere possit: Nullum etenim vinculum ad astringendam fidemiure inrando maiores arctius esse voluerunt.</hi> For our Elders were of opinion, that there could not bee deuised any firmer bond to retaine a mans faith, than his solemne oath.</p>
            <p>If Princes therefore will hold this course in planting Counsellors, many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> very noble persons by birth, will with vertuous studies furnish and enable themselues for those Offices: and suppose, they beeing licenciously nuzzled in delicate effeminacie, corrupt their natures with pestilent sluggishnesse; yet will other ingenuous spirits (not so pampered and assotted with sensualities
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7338:26"/>
in their education) naturally contend to become absolute, and with some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and practise prooue planets of happinesse to the Commonwealth, where they minister.</p>
            <p>In my iudgement that was a very strange and politicke prouision of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times in Fraunce, which did so worke in the phantasticall spirits of those Noblemen: For <hi>Vincentius Lupanus</hi> noteth, That they did abhorre as a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie base, barbarous, and disgracefull, that their gentlemen of the most liberall birth and nature, should bee learned in the liberall Sciences and in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie: prouiding onely, that their education should tend to good skill in horsemanship, in hunting, and in the practise of armes. In which opinion it seemeth to mee, that they were formerly confirmed, and animated by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> kings of that realme vpon very prudent respects: howbeit, I could neuer read it written in any booke, neither haue I receiued it from the mouth of any mans opinion, what cause might induce them to that kind of stupiditie. But (vnder pardon) I deeme, that they being of a fierie, stirring, and haughtie sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke (as the noble natures of that Nation hath beene many times by many wise obseruers noted) and being rooted or implanted rather to the ciuile fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of diuerse Dukes and pettie princes, through blood and alliance oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely combined against some kings, and others of those prouinces; it hath beene a kind of foolish caball, tending to the preseruation of that State, and taught vnto them for the priuation of their rationall and intellectuall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which otherwise, through their sedicious complots and deuices, (such as haue alwayes beene plentifull amongst them) they might haue coyned out of the noble mint of hystories and other politike discourses, and therewithall endangered the publicke state. For certaine it is, that (by the goodnesse of God, and the naturall benefit of that climate vnder which they liue) those no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men of Fraunce are docile, ingenuous, apprehensiue, variable, rash, and for the most part fitter for alteration than confirmation of great affaires. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, in the flourishing age of king <hi>Frauncis</hi> the first, some threescore and ten yeares past, at what time God graciously visited the most parts of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with his spirit of all true knowledge and literature; when the most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> comfortable beames of his blessed sonne our Sauiour Christ his Gospell, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and infernall eclipse of ignorance, beautifully brast out, and was dispersed amongst the poore, leane, and hunger-starued sheepe of his pasture, as well with vs in these Realmes, as with them, and in Germanie: euen then did the French Nobilitie take it as their highest honour, and a true type of perfect glorie to bee learned in all vertuous contemplation and studies, that therein also (which so much surreacheth momentanie fortunes) they might like as many starres surmount, and be discerned from the vulgar sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ddowes. So that vnto men enriched with those noble qualities, the prince vertuously studying to glorifie the state of that flourishing kingdome, diuolued the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and noblest Maiesties, Offices, and Magistracies of his state (whereof the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is infinite) vnto such as were learned and vertuous. <hi>Sola namque virtus vera Nobilitas est.</hi> For very Nobilitie is composed of vertue onely. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine is it found in all kingdomes, That if the Prince delight in hunting, Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7338:26"/>
Musicke, Armes, Astrologie, &amp;c. not onely those neerest him in court, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but the vulgar will fashion themselues, according to their abilities vnto such studies and pleasures. And (if hee take comfort in wise and honorable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours) all his Nobles and Barons within the space of foure or fiue yeares will bee fit to serue in secret Councell to the best princes of the world; nay more, a king may make apt Counsellors of very meane men <hi>(Qui maioribus suis virtute praelucent:</hi> Which giue more light of vertue than their ancestors) onely by this rule: so that his house or Court shall soone become a Schoole-house or Colledge of sapience and vertue.</p>
            <p>This likewise in the election of a Counsellor is one exceeding Principle, That euery Prince in the beginning of his reigne, without very weightie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> cause to the contrarie, continue those Counsellors in their places, being left in seruice of his predecessor. Which wisedome hath well appeared in your most worthily renowned Maiestie; who with good successe and auspicious grace yeelded your selfe to that course, vpon your Graces imitation to your heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this Crown imperiall of England, with the royalties annexed. Which some writers haue noted in diuers prudent kings, but amongst others in <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, the French king: who being readie to depart this life, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the trust of his sonne <hi>Charles</hi> the eight (then readie to succeed) the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of those Counsellors which instantly did serue him; intimating to him in this caueat, That hee by good experience in himselfe had formerly felt the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> smart which ensued vpon the displacing of such approued, vertuous, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest ministers. Whose counsell tooke such effect with king <hi>Charles,</hi> that hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in such happie state amongst his Peeres and Counsell, as that in griefe conceiued of his death, two of his Officers about his person, then in seruice, suddenly died also. This <hi>Charles</hi> was so beloued, as hath not beene mentioned in the French histories of any king like him, except of the Emperour <hi>Titus;</hi> before whom (for his humanitie, lenitie, liberalitie, goodnesse, and vertues) he was much preferred.</p>
            <p>Vnto the making vp of this politicke bodie, the profit, ruine, honour, and shame of the prince and subiects are surely fastened. It behooueth therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> specially, that Princes haue a sharpe sight into them of this societie: for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit some could be contented to deceiue; yet those finding the Prince more warily like a carefull father than a vigilant tyrant, which attendeth bloodie vantages, to looke into their actions, become faithfull, albeit against their will: and then being well encouraged with dignities and preferments in their diligence and honesties, they shall not haue any cause to wring from others vniustly: insomuch as they (finding that the prince groweth studious of their weale) shall bee mooued entirely to neglect their owne priuate, for the better aduauncement of his seruice, and Maiestie. In which, if they doe not both of them keepe rule, space, time, tune, and eare recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then shall they both certainely mistake in the descant of their plaine song.</p>
            <p>Hereupon dependeth also, that secret Counsellors (in weightie matters by the Prince to them concredited) keepe counsell and secrecie: for (it being
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7338:27"/>
deemed most odious, when a priuate person dispaleth the secrets of his friend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that relieth vpon his Taciturnitie) how much more contemptuous and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable is it in him, which discloseth the priuate consultations of his Prince; when such ouerture portendeth great dammage to the Common-wealth? Heerein he reuerseth his truest honours, violateth royall affiance, and without any sence or religion had of his oath, (as impiously prophaned, as assumed solemnely) transgresseth to the death. In these considerations it is most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull to conceale matters important from the knowledge of women; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselues by nature commonly desirous to heare, to know, and to talke all things. And hence was it, that <hi>Salust</hi> inueighing against <hi>Cicero,</hi> did obiect, That he did <hi>Cum Terentia vxore consulere de Republica:</hi> That hee did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> consult with his wife <hi>Terentia</hi> concerning State-matters. Certainely, such Counsellors (if a man may so tearme them, because they cannot keepe counsell, but lay that open to the great harme which is deliuered vnto them in trustiest secret for the generall good) are for the most part basely disposed, vicious, loaden with heinous crimes and nefarious practises, vaine, audacious; which glorie (to their owne shame) hauing no power nor moderation in hand, tongue, or heart: such as <hi>Quintus Curius,</hi> who communicating with a noble Romane strumpet called <hi>Fuluia;</hi> the treasons of <hi>Lucius Catiline</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was a vigilant partisan and principall Sergeant himselfe) euen in the very forge of their treasonable practises, subuerted himselfe, with all his complots <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and complices. But it is euident by the example of young <hi>Papirius,</hi> (when vpon the importunacie which his mother vsed, to learne out of him the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates seerets) that he deuised a ridiculous bait, which tempted her with other Ladies verbally to prostitute their shame in the Senate; wherein they made manifest their owne intemperance: but concerning this, being so common and notable, I referre them that list, to the Historie. Of the like nature was <hi>Sempronia,</hi> of whom <hi>Salust</hi> sayth, That it could not be discerned, whether she were more prodigall of her owne good fame, or of her money: <hi>Sic enim li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidine accensa fuit vt saepiùs viros peteret, quam peteretur: quae sibi fidem prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat, &amp; creditam abiurauerat:</hi> For so vehement was the fire of her lust, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
               <note place="margin">In coniur. Cat.</note> shee did much more desire mens companies, than men did hers: who did betray the trust of those that reposed in her, and perfidiously deale with those that credited her. It is not vnknowne what ciuile calamities in the Realme of Fraunce, both amongst the royall brethren and princes thereof, happened vpon participation in the great Counsels of that State with the late Queene mother <hi>Caterina di Medici,</hi> daughter to the Duke of Florence: and it cannot but be fresh in their remembrance through Christendome by them of this late age; because no Commonwealth, but hath in some one or other thing suffered extremities, when this <hi>Cath.</hi> (as a President to both the Counsels of Fraunce) steered the helme of that Commonwealth, which shee misguided <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> after her owne lust and pleasure.</p>
            <p>Vpon diuers considerations by that law <hi>Salique</hi> (which king <hi>Pharamonde</hi> made in his owne patrimonie neere Xantoigne, called <hi>Salique,</hi> whereupon <note place="margin">Ioh. Tilius in Com. de Reb. gall.</note> that denomination first was) women were exempted from many priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7338:27"/>
And <hi>Gaguinus</hi> noteth of king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth of Fraunce, which in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 10.</note> his last Testament at his death amongst other things entreated his sonne the good king <hi>Charles</hi> to commit no councell of trust vnto his mother <hi>Charlotte</hi> the Duke of Sauoyes daughter, which scarcely did liue one whole yeare dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager after her husband: peraduenture he doubtfully fantasied, that she had vniustly or wickedly dealt with him in his estate or life. But I will not insist herein, submitting my selfe to them which are the fathers of wisedome and experience, and can discreetly tell how with honour and constancie to bridle their affections in such cases; hauing by good example of others more power in this vertue to performe, than the most wise &amp; valiant of mortall men, king <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Sampson</hi> had before; whose prudence and fortitude were scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and subuerted by women. Howbeit, I doe not here intend from all sorts of women, and in anie weightie causes of consequence to make a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of foeminine insufficiencie; because in other greater causes of right and gouernment (according to the auntient lawes, priuiledges, and customes of diuers Realmes and Countries) there is great reason why they should retaine their immunities: as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth was sometimes in Fraunce: <hi>Cum Celta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In tractas. de mulier, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>mulieres Consilijs publicis interfuissent, in quibus de pace &amp; bello tract abatur:</hi> At what time the French women were alwaies present at their publique Counsels; in all matters ciuill and militarie. For hee saith in the said Treatise, how such articles of confederacie were betwixt the Gaules and <hi>Hanniball,</hi> that the Carthaginian Magistrates should order all wrongs done vnto them by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Celtes; and that the Celtique women answerably, such wrongs as was done vnto the Gaules by the Carthaginians. Which auncient custome being odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to diuers princes of that Realme in posteritie, might peraduenture haue giuen cause vnto king <hi>Pharomonde</hi> of his law. But sure it is, that many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue worthely gouerned heretofore in diuers places: And diuerse very learned and politicke women, such as <hi>Aspasia,</hi> whom <hi>Pericles</hi> loued, and with whom <hi>Socrates</hi> did often consult. Howbeit if Counsels of the state in these our dayes should be referred vnto them. I thinke neither the time nor date of their continence and experience would permit the same againe in Fraunce. But that I may conclude vpon this point of secrecie: for by that peculiaritie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Counsellors ought to be chosen and cherished. It is written in <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi> how the Egyptians did ordaine, That hee which opened the secrets of <note place="margin">Biblioth.

Those sixtie learned Areopagites of Athens did carefully prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this crime also.

            <p>It is required in persons of so worthy place and nobilitie, that to this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse they superadde fortitude and honest constancie towards the defence and maintenance of iustice and truth both in giuing, receiuing, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Counsell, as is warned by the example of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> the thirtieth and last Monarch of the Assyrians; who through his sensualitie, pusillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, lacke of grace, and of true fortitude, was within his huge citie Niniuie

In the Prince therfore principally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is required, and next in his secret Counsellors, whose vertues should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate him.</p>
            <p>There is one most excellent note of true fortitude, remaining vnto such honourable Counsellors, by the example of <hi>Scauola,</hi> viuely manifesting a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> heart, fortified with a iust and vnstained conscience: hee, when <hi>Sylla</hi> with multitudes of men in armes had entred the Senate, implacably thirsting after the destruction of <hi>Marius,</hi> whom hee would haue had by the Senatours then present, denounced a common enemie to the state: onely <hi>Scaeuola</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to giue voice against him, euen when <hi>Sylla</hi> with most truculencie threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened him to the contrarie, saying: Albeit thou darest mee with these heapes of souldiors, with which thou distressest this honourable presence, although thou breath forth death against me, yet will not I condiscend (in loue of my blood, which is both aged and little) to denounce <hi>Marius</hi> our enemy, through whose valour and honestie my conscience attesteth, how the citie Rome, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> all Italie, was preserued.

Now to remedie Counsellors which are timorous and doubtfull in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and resolutions: first, let it be considered, that all humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are subiect to many perils, but wise men ought to know, that all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes which may come, doe not happen generally: whereas very many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish by the benefit of fortune, and multitudes also by prouidence &amp; industrie: for by considering, foreseeing, and weighing many matters, men become very warie.</p>
            <p>The generall good qualities, which like so many precious stones, as vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These be the men which worthily spend the vertues and good faculties of their life in rule and magistracie, which liue in the sight of many. These are they whose actions are recorded in mens hearts, and though Hystories should faile, would remaine by tradition in the memorials of posteritie. If therefore they be noble by birth, let them beare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> their estates without pride: if they sit vpon the seate of magistracie, let them maintaine their reputation without insolence, contempt, or enuie of persons inferiours, equals, or superiours. If they be verely religious, and spiritually lightened with the knowledge, feare and worship of God, let them set their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7338:29"/>
hearts free from superstition: if their learning purchase for them reuerence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> let them humble themselues the more, abhorring arrogancie: if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the person of grauitie, let them performe the same with all decencie, void of hypocrisie. In their studies and contemplations let them declare fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuitie: let them be constant in good resolutions without repining and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse: let them likewise shew good affabilitie to the people, without any smoke of popularitie: for when they shall consider, how <hi>the greatest fortunes haue least libertie, they will auoid all apparance of euill, concealing it from the vulgar.</hi> I meane in speciall those vices of pride and perturbation; as malice, hatred, and apparant anger; which are in meane men though a little noted, yet not long remembred, but in persons of their ranke and authoritie miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and perillously pointed at; yea, and engrauen with a penne of steele by the names of Pride and Crueltie.</p>
            <p>There are besides all these, diuerse other notable qualities, many of which are included in this breuiat, and required to the complete force of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor. First, and aboue all other ornaments, his wastcoat and secret armour priuate to the soule, from whence all his vertues flourish, and his robe of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere honour in highest counsels and iudgements, must bee made of zealous holinesse, which is the most venerable defence of such a reuerend Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. He must therefore bee studious of Theologie: for where impietie ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth all feare, and feeling of sinne; and for as much as all Counsels of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wicked are fraudulent, it must necessarily follow, that through them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of true religion (being the soule of euery well instituted State) force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably dependeth, dragging violently with it the Commonwealths subuersion. This diuine knowledge illuminateth his reason and vnderstanding, adding quicknesse and courage to discerne and punish persons that freese, draw backe, or stagger in cases of religion; either by their contempt of the deitie, or in ignorance of Gods true worship. This ensigneth the readiest and best course, which he should obserue in extirpation of contagious schismes and pestilent sects: and how to continue with stedfast and often prayer in faith towards God for the true sapience of his holy spirit; which is reuealed in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <note place="margin">1. Corinth. cap. 2</note> mysterie, being a concealed wisedome, and determined by God before the world for our glorification.

But such as are wise feare that vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power filially; which is with a kind of heart-longing loue: and vnto such alone and assuredly hath his diuine omnipotencie prepared that, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> neither eye, eare, nor heart hath seene, heard, or certainely conceiued; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing vnto them those arcane and sacred mysteries by the spirit of holinesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7338:30"/>
cleere sanctitie, and it is full of the power of loue and mercie: which loue of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> God, <hi>Salomon</hi> calleth honourable wisedome; it beeing accompanied with feare and reuerence: which is of it selfe a sacred knowledge, by vertue thereof is mans heart iustified: honour and long life are the braunches of it, fastened in the sacred root of wisedome by faith, which vanquisheth sinne and death, faith and meekenesse attending it. This heauenly loue illuminateth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most transubstantiateth our hearts of flesh by the power of God, which our Sauiour Christ (speaking to the woman of Samaria) calleth a spirit, saying, That such as worship God, must doe the same in spirit and truth. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will learne, tast, and loue that sacred word and knowledge, which is the pure fountaine of true wisedome, the sweetnesse of which (alas) I neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> can vtter nor conceiue. After this knowledge of God, with the sincere loue of true religion, there is another kind of pietie, most excellently commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a Counsellor; which is, in suffering punishments cheerefully for the exact obseruation of his late deceased Soueraignes constitutions, as also prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for the confession of his faith, that neither superiorities, honours, or any carnall and earthly respects, feares, punishments, or martyrdomes may take him from the reuerence and most sweet loue of God, which remaineth with him in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>The next care immediate after the knowledge of God, consisteth in his skill of gouernment and studie to maintaine the Commonweale: which weale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> doth not onely comprehend the generall good, but the benefit and safegard of all priuate persons therein. These so combine and loue like turtles, that one cannot liue without fellowship of another. In which his studious and inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable loue of the Commonwealth he must sequester so farre his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate profit and authoritie, that he be found at all times readie to bestow his honour, substance, and life in maintenance thereof: so should hee therefore respect the state and affaires of his countrey, by the prince referred to him, as <hi>Cicero</hi> sayth, <hi>Vt vtilitas sua communis vtilitas sit: vicissim &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereupon that whole nauie, to the irrecouerable losse of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> became a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7338:30"/>
spoyle to their enemies. But <hi>Qu.

Fabius</hi> who by cunctation had giuen life and honour to his countrey, was for his actions of valour, and in perpetuall glorie thereof cannonized in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Hystories by the title of <hi>Maximus.</hi> And hereupon this as a certaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> note and rule may be grounded, that all hypocrites, coue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ous, and vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious persons (such as doe with <hi>Calicratides</hi> more prize their priuat glory than the publicke weale) are enemies to the generall state; and such vndoubtedly (like flatterers) if time should so serue, would not sticke (to the end they might endanger the Prince thereby) to say, That all the peoples wealth is his. By which example we viuely find represented vnto vs the warie circumspection of a good Commonwealths man in the person of <hi>Fabius,</hi> studying the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation and honour of himselfe and of his countrey, together with the rash and foolish negligence of a vaine-glorious hypocrite, like <hi>Calicratides;</hi> which so sleightly valued the conseruation and weale of his owne Nation. In this loue and care of the Commonwealth is required a due consideration, how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the whole politicke societie consisteth of soule and bodie; the soule (as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid) for religion, in aduancing and maintaining the true worship of God; the bodie taken for the dwelling or place of habitation. There is likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that soule and bodie the spirit of liuing, which is the mouing and stirring of the bodie: this may bee properly called or compared rather to the forme of euery Commonwealth, as in knowing whether it be a Monarchie, as great <hi>Brittaine, Fraunce, Ireland, Spaine, Castile,</hi> and <hi>Portugall:</hi> or as the Empires of the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Moscouites,</hi> but more remote: or if an Aristocracie, like <hi>Venice;</hi> wherein are foure Counsels, besides the Senate and gentlemen of that state.

            <p>In this my Counsellor, I would require much readinesse, and quicknesse of wit: for moderate sharpenesse and dexteritie compose the heads, bodies, and fect of all good actions. That light therefore, which beautifieth euerie noble and excellent wit, must be diuine, singular, and vnusuall. Howbeit, a politicall wit, (if I may so tearme it) <hi>Quasinatum ad congregationem &amp; socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem:</hi> As instituted to congregate, and advn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> is that wit which euery gentleman (that purposeth to trauaile into forraine countries) ought to be possessed of, and without it, <hi>Caelum non animum mutat:</hi> He changeth his nation, and not his condition: Because it teacheth him the formes, constitutions, augmentations, diminutions, mutations, lawes, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, rites, and iudgements of those nations, where he soiourneth. It is the true guide and sweet companion of iourneyes and peregrination, according to the saying of <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Xenophon: Generosumest &amp; omnifauore dignum ingenium, cui sunt cordi disciplinae politicae:</hi> That wit is generous, and deserueth all fauour, which taketh delight in politicall discipline.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7338:31"/>
wit neuer walketh in wayes vulgarly frequented, neuer speaketh after the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vulgar fashion, neuer is mercinarie, neuer abruptly breaketh off a period; but doth all things with exceeding decencie. No man which is verely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thied in regard of his wit, that taketh any delight in base and common matters, sayth <hi>Seneca: Et magna quae sunt ingenia aegrè serunt iniuriam:</hi> Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">Epist. 39. lib. 5.</note> wits cannot easily brooke iniuries: according to <hi>Salust.</hi> Other garbes and attributes are likewise obserued in these wits: as in the entertainement, <note place="margin">In bell.

All actions flourishing out of it are cheerefull, and perfected with a commendable spirit, working alwayes in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, contemplation, comprehension, and (as it were) a palpitation of all things, exercised in much reading, conference, and societie, with people of all conditions and humors, busied in knowledge of matters past, present, and to come, studying to be generally wel skilled in all laudable arts, neuer slouthfull, neuer wearie, triumphing in many labours, vexations, and troubles: <hi>Quippè secundaeres sapientum animos fatigunt.</hi> Such a wit should seeme was in <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> whose businesse seemed most great, when his action was least: <hi>Nec</hi>

Such wits sweetly flourish in youth, and plentifully fructifie, resembling (as <hi>Plato</hi> compareth it) a fruitfull meddow.

These obseruations are required in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Counsellor, and yet wholly depending vpon his excellent wit: which I last before touched; seruing as a precious elixar of life, and mettall for many strange purposes. And by these notes and qualities of Oratorie, (if any viue ember, or spiracle of ingenuous facilitie remaine in men) it shall appeare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuously.</p>
            <p>The well speaking of many languages may bee mustered amongst the rest for one speciall and most needfull qualitie: in speciall, the tongues of those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> kingdomes and prouinces which are either subiects contributaries or confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to the prince, and also the languages of his enemies: as appeareth in the learnedest of our princes his Counsell at this day. For amongst them the Greeke, Latine, Italian, Spanish, French, Danish, Polish, and Dutch tongues
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7338:33"/>
are well spoken and vnderstood. This is a comfortable benefit, when forraine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> people either with vs at home or abroad, are heartely glad to vnderstand, and to be vnderstood by those with whom they haue businesse, opening their own meanings better and more perspicuously by their owne mouth, than with helpe of an interpretor. Mutuall counsels likewise may by this knowledge be more safely debated, than by meanes of a third person interpreting: what more beneficiall commendation, than to heare, vnderstand, and deliberate vpon peaceable and hostile legations. If they bee friends, it better confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth their amitie, when Counsellors consult or debate with them in their owne language; persuading themselues commonly, that it proceedeth from loue and good obseruation. Admit they be sometimes deceiued in that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> yet such a kind of frustration is auaileable. And suppose them ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which so conferre with you, by that occasion their beneuolence is so much the sooner attained.</p>
            <p>It must be noted also, that few men interprete perfectly, many more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying their owne humors, than the precise meaning of the parties, adding or substracting somewhat alwayes. What if vnder pretext of interpretation a referendarie be foisted in, vpon whose secrecie the whole weale and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a king with all his Soueraignetie dependeth? Admit the matters so require, that no delayes without danger will serue to dispatch present answer to the Prince: is it not then a double shame and offence, to make enquirie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for such an interpretor as will deale faithfully? What if no fit man can bee found out of hand? Or if hee bee found, admit the one partie credite not his interpretation? All these are most dangerous difficulties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the knowledge of tongues is of speciall force in a secret Counsellour; and also that he know the fashions and conditions of those people, whose language he speaketh: but for the prince chiefely necessarie, that his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors can speake, write, and interprete in those tongues before him, rather than repose affiance in strangers: Which trust is commonly fallacious, and then vndoubtedly pernicious. The cause why, the Latine and Greeke lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages are so commonly studied and embraced in most parts of the world, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is in regard of their many most learned bookes and monuments of former time. The reason of their so many volumes and written workes, is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from their auncient and ample Monarchies, endowed formerly with so many precious spirits; which both for ciuile and militarie knowledge so much surpassed and exceeded. Their leagues, tributes, lawes, ciuile cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes; their many battailes, victories, and triumphs: as those of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Caesar,</hi> and of others infinite, beeing speciall attributes of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, gaue infinite matter to noble wits in those Empires continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to write such excellent dignities and exploits, as their natiue countrey men had borne away, with much honour and renowne, both in peace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and warre. The Princes, Consuls, Dictators, and Emperors yeelding royall encouragement and most munificent salaries to those Writers, (for their owne glories sake, which by such their art and industrie were ennobled) did make infinite the numbers of bookes, and Authors in all liberall faculties.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7338:34"/>
The multitudes of those bookes (through the greatnesse of these Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> were farre and neere dispersed. The learning of those volumes (after the dissolution of these Empires) hath beene euermore and againe thirsted and hunted after by the best and all well disposed Commonweales and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which since that time were alwayes enlightened by them, yeelding a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall patterne of perfect humane knowledge to posteritie. And in these later ages (since the time of our Sauiour Christ, of his Apostles, of their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and of those fathers, which succeeded them in the Primitiue Church, being through Greece and old Italie then dispersed) the very light of sweete Gospell hath beene by these means reserued vnto vs in those two languages: and therefore haue these tongues, (so needfull for the interpretation of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Scriptures, the enucliation of verities, and confutation of heresies) still kept afoot the studies of them through the grace of God amongst vs to this day. The Hebrew tongue not so much in generall desire of schollers, seruing spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the legall Scriptures and Prophets, I will pretermit, as also the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daean, Syrian, and Arabicke, peculiar to deepe Diuines and Doctors of the Church, <hi>Thalmudistes, Alcumistes,</hi> and <hi>Caballistes,</hi> surreaching the common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension and vse of Counsellors and States-men. Heereupon a question may bee proiected vnto mee, Why then these Greeke and Latine languages might not serue <hi>(instar omnium)</hi> to fulfill all meanings &amp; purposes by good and faithfull vnderstanding amongst princes and nations in their treaties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> leagues, pactions, sessions, conuentions, accords, assemblies, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuate parlyes of like nature, being tongues so generally well knowne and studied in so many Realmes? My solution is replicatiuely, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not passe currant amongst all forraine princes and much remote Monarchies: for if that amplitude of the former Grecian and Romane dominions, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned a kind of vniforme, vse, or peculiaritie of those tongues, as being the true mother languages in all the Realmes, Prouinces, and Seignories subiected to them: it doth then illatiuely follow by the like necessitie, that if our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes neere vs should send in very weightie causes men of perfection in those two languages, to the great Turke or Persian, it would bee very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and troublesome: for so much as their Monarchies extend much further than all Christendome doth beside. Wherefore I iudge (by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) that the language amongst them is for the most part either Persian or Turkish, and not knowne to any Christians, except to some few Christian merchants or slaues, which haue commerced with them. For since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of those Mahemetane Monarchies of Turkes and Persians, our Christians haue alwayes held that people execrable and perfidious: so that their vulgar speech (by those Christians which inhabit the very skirts of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key vnder <hi>Rodolph</hi> the Emperour) is little or not at all practised in these dayes. Besides, what a shame it were concerning certaine honourable affaires and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> policies of the State in any Realmes and Common-weales to chuse some merchant or negotiator, which should discharge the Office of a most noble embassadour, and to deale in causes of highest consequence onely, because he can speake and vnderstand the Persian or Turkish tongues. Neither will
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7338:34"/>
that excellent Greeke tongue, which former writers haue vsed, and which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> at this day so much practised amongst the Schollers in Christendome, serue therefore in those Pagan parts, in regard, that all or the greatest part of Greece is now subiect to the Turke, and in such respect sooner vnderstood: because that excellent refined Greeke (euen as in old Italie the Latine) is wholly corrupt and altered, through the long and ruinous discontinuance of those two famous Monarchies. I conclude therefore, that it is not onely needfull for such as are Counsellors to mightie Kings and Princes, to be well skilled in the best languages of Christendome; but much behoofefull in respect of the Turkes and Persians also: which thing though it may seeme amongst our countrey nobles rare and difficult, yet is <hi>tanto preclarius, &amp; viro verè nobili</hi>

This contempt and viletie therfore hath hetherto letted many singular wits of excellent hope and learning (wherewithall by the naturall temperature of that climat vnder which we liue, our nation is diuinely endowed) to write bookes in English: and the neglect thereof I feare hath hurt vs in the glorie of that sweet Latine tongue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> also: for it was not vnknowne to the learned of this nation, how little their language was and would be respected in other countries.

            <p>It is most certaine, that ingenuous natures and vertuous spirits (whose di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine rationall ought to be fixed vpon perfect glorie) are in a continuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and ciuile commotion within themselues, if they doe not imploy their cogitations and studies in morall contemplation, still labouring like a woman <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> with child to bring forth some excellent faire birth like themselues.

The knowledge of all persons, the meaning of all matters, the depth of all secrets is locked vp in Hystorie. In it wee find that inestimable treasure of the Lawes, by which Commonweales were first ordered and instituted, in the sentences of sage and prudent men; confirming societies in peace, and magnifying them by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vertues: like Physicke, which is an hystoricall commemoration or rapsodie of experiments, made by Physitions of old; by whose Aphorismes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts our Physitions direct their iudgements and medicines: it is a methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Schoole-master of humane life, examplifying the fashions and natures of people, a certaine experience of their actions, a sound and prudent Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor in difficult affaires.

            <p>The case is lamentable, and I haue many times with heauinesse thought it, how few be the Chronologiers and Historians of our age, how doubtfull and vnfaithfull much of their matter, how fearefully and vainly seduced by mispri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zion and affection. Sure I am, that infinite actions remaine worthie the penne of hystories: nay, that which men write of their own princes and nation, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth lesse to truth than vnto vaine-glorie: but that which is written by men of forraine princes &amp; people (such as <hi>Mercury Gallobelgicus</hi> falsely proclaimed in his Annales of the world) is both vncertaine, fallacious, and strongly sauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of malice, blind zeale, and partiall motions of the mind. Whereas if men would faithfully search out by the true records and memorials of realmes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Commonweales the vertuous and vicious actions of princes and people, how would it instigate and deterre the well and ill affected rulers and commons of the world to take hold and detestation of goodnes &amp; euill? In reading of them therefore we must carefully quote the map of actions, with the times &amp; places, the causes, executions, and euents of things, wherein some did prosper, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perish, with the reasons why those were gracious, and these vnwelcome. If any glorious matter happened, whether it came by chaunce or felicitie, by vertue, or good counsell, what impediments in contrarie did cause it miscarry. A Counsellor should also consider by this knowledge, what alterations haue formerly beene: as in the realmes of England, Scotland, Fraunce, Ireland, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Spaine, Denmarke, Italy, with other Nations: what Families possessed the Crownes of them, and by what titles and meanes, how long, what the causes of those mutations were, how many of euery familie did reigne, which of the princes was most religious, valiant, wise, and fortunate; which not: how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny battailes euery prince fought, against whom, at what time, where, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what occasion: what warres haue beene for a thousand and six hundred yeeres past and since, betwixt England and Fraunce, England and Scotland, England and Spaine, England and Ireland, England and Denmarke: what with Wales, what with Heathens, and Mahemetans: what ciuile and intestine commotions: which and in how many battailes that were conquerors: what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> occasioned their ruine or victorie; also the causes and captaines of commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how they were vanquished or quieted: what benefite or mischiefe ensued thereon. Hee that can well and aptly make relation hereof, may passe the muster, with more than ordinarie pay for his paines.</p>

If a Counsellor therefore, hauing vnderstanding requisite, accustome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with patience in much reading, (which is commonly most yrkesome to the purest and most precious wits) that benefite is vnspeakeable, which by the knowledge of hystories shall enrich his mind and vnderstanding: conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how the examples of a priuat and publicke life, the beginnings, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, proceedings, conseruations, and inclinations of realmes, with all ciuile commutations, are discouered by them.

            <p>Prudence is one speciall gift of God, attained by prayer and the due feare of his Maiestie, which (as the wise <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth) is the <hi>beginning of all wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>

Prudence therefore is the Gouernesse and Iudge of all vertue, the knowledge which teacheth men how to liue blamelesse, or a true mentall affection, declaring (as <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth) what honest and profitable things (with their contraries) wee should desire and detest.

Prudence is either large and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall, which wee may tearme heroicall prudence, or a vertue strict and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, that (being composed of consultation, cunning, opinion, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacitie) openeth the truth in all actions: and therefore it is imposed as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting iewell and endlesse victorie both in peace and warre, for any prince to weare neere himselfe. <hi>Duo sunt qua ab egregijs principibus expetuntur: san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitas domi, in armis fortitudo, vtrobique prudentia:</hi> Two properties are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <note place="margin">In vita Vlp. Traiani.</note> in excellent good princes: in his Realmes sanctitie, in his warres for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; in both places prudence. The substance of prudence is truth; by which humane reason should entirely be gouerned. Truth is the Medium <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> betwixt arrogance and dissimulation, mouing men to shew themselues plaine in word and deed. There is another definition of politicall truth, not much different: <hi>which is a kind of habite, to speake a truth in all publicke and priuate causes, without any fraud, arrogance, or dissimulation.</hi> Towards the knowledge of truth (by lore of Philosophie) fiue vertuous qualities are required. The first is Science, being a sure and infallible knowledge and apprehension of any thing, which may proceed out of the causes thereof, either by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall instinct, or some other reasonable demonstrations: as in Theologicall and Mathematicall practise: for so much as the learning contained in those Sciences, teacheth such things as cannot easily be wrested otherwise by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> As first appeareth by the definition of Religion, which is the seale or bond of Theologie, being the true feare, loue, and honour of God: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion bringeth a zealous care and reuerent ceremonie towards the worship of a superiour nature; which nature we call diuine, because it so farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7338:38"/>
the corruption and perfectest apprehension of man: and amongst others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto the kings of this earth, as a monition or exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is deliuered: <hi>Vnderstand, O you Kings: serue the Lord with feare, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in him with trembling, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore if religion were nothing but humane policie (which the damned and execrable Atheists imagine in their foolishnesse) yet must wee certainely know, that if the feare of God aboue were not, men would contemne all lawes and vertue: imagining, that all men had free leaue in their owne corrupt natures (which they most impiously would make their God, and be by the same directed) to doe their owne hearts lusts. The Mathematickes also <hi>(Quae sunt quasi comites &amp; administrae viri po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litici:</hi> Which are as it were the companions and agents of a Polititian: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> which <hi>Plutarch</hi> placeth in the soule of man, as being a part of the Theorique <note place="margin">In Moral.</note> or contemplatiue faculties) are arts likewise, which cannot otherwise bee wrested. And hence is it, that Science is called, <hi>Habitus demonstrandi per cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sas:</hi> A habite of demonstration by reasons. The second meanes towards the knowledge of truth, is art: being a kind of mentall habit or experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall skill to performe and perfect things by such means, as without them they otherwise may bee done; and as <hi>Tacitus</hi> writeth: <hi>Apud maiores virtutis id praemium fuit, cunctisque ciuium (si fiderent bonis artibus) licitum petere Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 11. Annal.</note> It was proposed to our auncestors, and vnto all citizens for a reward of their vertues, and as a thing allowable, to sue for reputations and offices, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> if they did build vpon their knowledge in good arts. And from hence are all trades, professions, and mysteries (by which men liue and attaine worldly happinesse) drawne and deriued. The third part of truth is Prudence it selfe, being a certaine habite, effecting such things by reason, as either tend vnto the weale or harme of persons. Hence is it called Prudence in men, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult graciously for themselues and others, to gouerne priuate families, and to serue or minister vnto the Commonwealth in publicke causes fortunately and beneficially. The fourth being Intelligence, nobly placed in the mind of man, is a kind <hi>of habite, moouing the mind, enclining and yeelding it selfe constantly to things, which cannot be by demonstration perfected.</hi> It is likewise a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> certaine habite of experiment had in the principles, or heads and grounds of causes, from whence all proofes are drawne. The adiuncts and parts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence (according to <hi>Metopius</hi> the Pythagorean Philosopher) are iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">In lib. de virt.</note> and contemplation, both of them issuing from reason. The fifth and last part of truth is Sapience; being a most absolute and perfect knowledge of such things as are contained within the limits of humane apprehension, as well in metaphysicall as in naturall causes: howbeit, especially leuelling at diuine matters, according to the definition of it: <hi>Quae est rerum diuinarum am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plissima scientia:</hi> Which is a most ample skill had of diuine matters. Onely that which regardeth humane policies or affaires, is more properly tearmed Prudence: which (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth) is the cause, meanes, or procurer of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>

The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects which ought to be required in a wife, are a diligent and dayly care of her house, that she personally looke to those houshold commodities and seruices her selfe as is fit: that she behaue her selfe honestly towards her husband: that she be no scold, nor maliciously demeane her selfe: that she teach and instruct <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> her children and women seruants in modest conuersation, knowledge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior: that she bee not proud, neither sumptuous nor sluttish: which those sweet Oracles of wisedome and Oratorie, king <hi>Salomon</hi> and blessed <hi>Paul</hi> haue diuinely and luculently declared, as is read in holy scriptures, That if strength serue, she giue sucke to her owne children her selfe: for as much as all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers hold it the most naturall and best course of nourishing infants: that she teach vnto them frugalitie, reseruing and encreasing her husbands stocke with her owne huswiferie.

            <p>In like sort, that children should bee brought vp in the true knowledge, feare, and worship of God, in obedience, loue, and honour, to their parents, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in patience of their fathers seueritie: that they bee silent without procacitie, when he speaketh: that they be dutifull vnto their schoolemasters, and vnto those that teach vnto them the gouernment of themselues: that they be studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of those arts and professions to which their parents haue applied them: that they be taught to loath pestilent idlenesse and voluptuositie, beeing the perdition and confusion of all youth, from the highest to the basest: that they be reuerend towards magistrates, and vnto their betters: that they bee true in word and deede: that they lend dutifull and willing eares vnto the words and instructions of men learned, honest, and wise: that they bee modest. For in all his Dialogues wee find, that <hi>Plato</hi> with most vehemence and principally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> doth adhort parents to be carefull in education of their children, verely belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, <hi>Non posse genus humanum absque gubernataribus vel honestè viuere, vel foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciter gubernari:</hi> That the children of men can neither liue honestly together, nor be gouerned happily without Masters and Rulers. Lastly, the duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in seruants, are subiection, fidelitie, promptnesse, attention, assiduitie, with obedience vnto their maisters frugalitie, moderation in diet, and apparrell, truth in matters concredited vnto their truth, patience, and facilitie: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I will (as before) referre my selfe in this true moralitie vnto the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, speaking in those Oeconomicall precepts and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were deliuered by the blessed Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their Epistles, and by our Sauiour Christ himselfe, in diuerse places and parables of his holy Gospell, diuinely shewing and teaching the duties

But iust Princes will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly commute, annihilate, or qualifie those lawes, by which their people may be preiudiced: for such Lawes and Statutes as concerne them, are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by their owne consents, not by royall prerogatiue onely. The second good State dependeth vpon that gouernment, which is referred to a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> number of the wiser noblemen: as if any Prince (being weake of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) should diuolue the whole administration of his State vnto the lords and fellowes of his counsell: and this is called Aristocracie. Which kind of state we reade in holy Scripture to haue continued vnder Iudges, from <hi>Moyses</hi> vnto
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7338:42"/>
the dayes of <hi>Eli:</hi> vnder whome the arke of Gods couenant was lost, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> politicall glorie lamentably defaced. But as it followeth, my iudgement yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the learneder opinions of others: That there is not any state so lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and diuine in earthly gouernment, as vnder one, according to that saying of <hi>Nestor</hi> in <hi>Homer:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Non multos regnare bonum, rex vnicus esto.</l>
                  <l>Vnius imperium, cui Iupiter aurea magnus</l>
                  <l>Sceptra dedit, iussitque suis dare iur a tuendis.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is not good, that many kings should rule at once ouer one people: let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> there bee one king and one kingdome, vnto whome the God of might hath deliuered the golden scepter, commaunding him to make lawes for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and tuition of his people.</p>
            <p>The third good estate of gouernment resteth in the discreet gubernation of the Commons, which is named a Democracie: such as gouerned Athens in times past, and the like amongst the Cantons of Swizzerland, at this day.</p>
            <p>Those other three remaining, and framed out of the excesse or outrage of these other three good states predefined, consist in tyrannie, by which the prince, according to lust, and beyond the limits of reason, law, or honestie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> cherisheth vicious persons, and by them strengtheneth his owne arme against all good people, which liue oppressed and tortured vnder his gouernment. The life of such tyrants is a continuall perillous and inward warre, because they cannot repute themselues safe either in front, in reare, or on the flankes, they miserably torture themselues with euerlasting danger &amp; feare. And those are commonly called <hi>Tyranni, qui vi &amp; armis imperium arripiunt:</hi> Which with force and in armes bereaue others of their Realms and Crownes. Such was <hi>Cirus Agathocles,</hi> and others infinite, which maintained their spoyles and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine by rauening and spoyling. These are they which despise iustice, lawes, and equitie; these which forsake the Commonwealth to multi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lie their owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> priuate estates; these which vexe and oppresse their people with grieuous and insupportable tributes and exactions, as vassales and slaues, base and abject: those of these conditions may not bee called kings, but tyrants and nefarious oppressors: for euen as rauenous wolues greedily rush vpon the flocke, so doe they, to dilaniate and deuour the people of God. The court of a good king containeth the least part of his riches, and his Commonwealth aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and ioyeth in all wealth and worldly felicitie. The tyrant hoordeth vp the peoples treasure, or employeth it to his priuate vse, impouerishing and excoriating the poore subiects. A good king hath a good Angell ayding him in the administration of his estate: a Tyrant is incensed and directed by a most malicious and wicked diuell. A good king punisheth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and preferreth the vertuous; a Tyrant cutteth off the liues of good men, and prolongeth the dayes of the wicked. A good king thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe most powerfull in riches, when his people doth abound in wealth.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7338:42"/>
A tyrant then reputeth himselfe most rich, when he hath robbed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of all their goods: a good king by the Philosophers is called a shepheard; a tyrant is tearmed a wolfe: finally the good and true king estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth much more the life and weale of his people, than his owne life. The Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant doth not only thirst after the riches and treasure, but euen after the bloud and liues of his subiects also.</p>
            <p>The second euill part of gouernment is called Oligarchie: which is when the Commonwealth or Vniuersalitie bee forceably yoaked vnder the violent lusts and empire of a few Nobles: as at Rome in the gouernment of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umuirate and Triumuirate: and in Anarchie, when the people confusedly by libidinous instinct and auaritious desire, make hauocke of all vnder their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vsing all kinds of dishonest pleasures and purchase, as a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and most needfull recreation and profite. For the deuill (which is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of confusion and disorder) raigneth in their spirits. Yea, ruinous and most desolate is that Nation like to prooue, whose lawes are made out of their owne lusts and perturbed appetites: <hi>Multitudo namque malis artibus imbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Salust in Orat. ad Ca. Caes.</note> 
               <hi>deinde in artes vitasque varias dispalata; nullo modo inter se congruens, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rùm idonea videtur ad capessendam rempublicam.</hi> For a multitude which is first disordered and euill affected, and then dispersed into diuers professions and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions of liuing, discordant within themselues, are not meete to take any charge or tuition of the Commonwealth. For the vulgar are neither wise nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> discreet, but rash and violent in all their commotions and passions; especially when they haue the reynes in their owne hands. The violence of which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouernment caused <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> a most learned and euer-renowned citizen of Athens, through the peruerse and vniust sentence of the barbarous Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, being banished (after the losse of his countrey liberties) to crie forth in the bitternesse of his spirit: <hi>O Pallas, Pallas, quae tribus infestissimis belluis dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaris, noctua, dracone, &amp; populo: O Pallas, Pallas,</hi> which takest pleasure in three most pernicious beasts; in an Owle, in a Dragon, and in the people. Which kind of gouernment is not vnproperly compared to the weltring and vnconstant billowes of the sea. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Romane policie, when their kings were abolished, was by the Senate managed a long time. After which the people retaining a Democraticall state (being attempered with the moderation and authorities royall, and with the Patricians, as appeared in the Consular estate, and in the Senators) did carrie with them the <hi>fasces</hi> and preheminence, vntill the reignes of <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Caesars.</hi> So that out of the Soueraigne rule of a kingdome, being reuiued in the Consuls; out of the gouernment Aristocraticall, represented by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators; and out of the Democracie, manifested in the Plebeian Tribunes, a firme and absolute Commonwealth was fashioned.</p>
            <p>Those Monarchies which are esteemed most perfect and excellent at this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> day, being established by the Senate or Counsell of most prudent persons, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced for their true nobilitie to that place with a kind of consent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the commons, doe moderate, and nobly restraine the princes force within the limits of his owne lawes, made and published for the benefit of his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7338:43"/>
people generally: by which meanes their wealth &amp; peace may be multiplied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> &amp; conserued; especially when the crowne is not bestowed vpon any through suffragation (as by briberie, faction, or affection) but by royall right of heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to princes next in succession by blood; as it is in this renowmed monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of Brittaine vnder your maiesties imperiall Scepter at this day: for euery good Commonwealth is vnder iust gouerment with excellent counsell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and amplified: neither can it but of force must otherwise be ruined and perish.</p>
            <p>For as much therefore as euery Commonwealth consisteth of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude (which should liue in vnitie together vnder one God, one king, and one law) I will speake somewhat of the incorporation and harmonious vnion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> people and nations one within another. So much the rather, because the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of our monarchie thus confirmed and happily lincked in vnion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it; in this semblably with all requisite humiliation, as in all other things, yeelding and submitting my iudgement to the correction of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>The first and best forme of gouernment and empire is, where one king mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateth and ruleth all nations vnder his dominion vnited, according to the true spirit of vertue, which domination is properly tearmed by the sages of wisedome a monocracie: for it representeth the perfect ordination of nature, by which euerie multitude and deformitie submitteth it selfe to some one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> thing which gouerneth the same; euen as all things mooueable are reduced vnto the first moouer or centre from which all Lines, Elements, and Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are deriued. For proofe hereof <hi>Herodian</hi> in his historie writeth, that <hi>Darius</hi> vpon a consultation, how the Persian state might be best established as a paranymph by the liuely force of a most eloquent oration defended the forme of a monarchie: which the Persian senate did also with one voice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud; declaring and proclaming him their king thereupon. The like part did <hi>Mecanas</hi> defend against <hi>Agrippa</hi> before <hi>Octauius Caesar,</hi> and preuailed: both <note place="margin">Dion. lib. 52.</note> their copious and effectuall orations are yet extant in <hi>Dion Cassius.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this both by diuine authorities, and humane nature, the blessed Apostle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> saith, that <hi>there is one head, one spirit, one lord.</hi> And it is written in the prophet <hi>Ezechias, My seruant Dauid shall be their king and onely shepheard oner them all.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. cap. 37.</note> Also wee find in the gouernement of nature amongst bees, one chiefe; one guide amongst cranes; one emperour or king amongst nations, vnited in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the righteous scepter of one; and one iudge or president ouer euery prouince. When Rome was first builded, it would not endure the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two brethren equall in empire. And in sacred monuments we find, that <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> disagreed in the very wombe of <hi>Rebecca. Vnum etenim ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustum non alit duos Erithacos:</hi> One bush will not admit two ruddockes at once <note place="margin">Genes cap. 25.</note> vpon it. Neither can the Empire or kingdome of any, brooke two Phoenixes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to liue at once. Nature also instructeth and teacheth vs how one ocean imboketh many riuers, which as contributaries, subiects, suppliants, and weake ones, haue recourse and admittance into the strong bosome of the vaste seas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7338:43"/>
In a Monarchie therefore, and in the whole course of euery good policie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> these three speciall are most certaine, and faithfully to bee receiued. The first is one God; without fellowship in power and vertue, whose sacred iealousie will not admit of any copartener or competitor, according to whose precepts and instructions deliuered, as it is written in those holy bookes to his faithfull seruants <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and after to the blessed Patriarkes, then to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Prophets: and lastly, by the blessed mouth of Christ Iesus his sonne our Sauiour vnto the sanctified Apostles, without addition, or diminution, our true Religion Catholicke, being the vertuous baulme of our mortified soules and bodies, wounded with the darts of sinne and death, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of the most precious and inestimable substance of our saluation is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> immoueably grounded.</p>
            <p>The second, one king, who semblably (without any competitor or associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate coequall in his authoritie) doth represent in himselfe the very person of royall iustice, according to that excellent verse of the Poet:</p>
            <lg>

bountifull and gracious ordinance of God, appointed for the weale of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> people. Also they that were so chosen in regard of their prudence, humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, temperance, and other excellent faculties, wherein they surpassed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were therefore called to the gouernment of people and nations, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall suffrages and ioyfull vnanimitie. Such was the election of <hi>Deioces</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Medians; of <hi>Samothes</hi> amongst our auncient Brittaines, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Gaules; of <hi>Minos</hi> in Crete; of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the successour of <hi>Romulus;</hi> who being absent, was chosen king of the Romanes, vehemently persuaded and vrged to take vpon him that Soueraignetie, which hee most peremptorily refused a long time: for a true king is the viue patterne and Idaea of all vertues, reuerenced amongst his people, subiects, and vassales, as a god <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> vpon earth: whose regall authoritie being receiued from the most great and ineffable prouidence, grace, and secret charter of God, vnder the blessed seale of his omnipotencie, ought by him in all humilitie to be continually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed and reacknowledged to his incomprehensible deitie. For God of himselfe being most wise, most iust, and most good, would haue a most wise, a most iust, and a most good vice-gerent to rule his people in all righteousnes and equitie. Yea, the barbarous rabble did so wonder and adore their first kings in those former ages, that they did faine and comment, how they were not dead, but translated into heauen amongst their prophane gods. Many write, that the three speciall vertues of a king, are Sapience, Iustice, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which without doubt are three of the foure triumphant wheeles of his renowned and euerlasting glorie: but certaine it is, that hee which is vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valiant, magnanimious, and industrious, and he that with assiduitie, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie, iustice, and equitie doth well gouerne his people, committed to his faith and sapience (after the manner of good shepheards which carefully guide and attend their flockes) doth doubtlessely discharge his function by iust meanes well and faithfully. Finally, these three properties are they which san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie him amongst his subiects, and through the whole world: Clemencie, which is the iewell of princes; Mercy the Sun-shine of kings; and Lenitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were the milke of maiestie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
            </p>
            <p>The third, one people including the Commonwealth, which also should acknowledge one only God and one king, considering the corporeall resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance which is betwixt him and God; both of them soueraigning ouer our soules and bodies in ecclesiasticall and ciuile lawes: for so much as wee be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally borne vnder that obedience, as those other two former by their proper power beare domination ouer the nations of this earth, God hauing his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of himselfe, infinite, omnipotent, and limitlesse; the king holding his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie by the deputation, grace, and sufferance of the most high God, as his immediate steward, to direct, and to see them instructed in his holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and commaundements as also with his owne ciuile and politicke sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to gouerne them, that they might liue in loue, peace, and vnion together, as one flocke, obedient and answering vnto the voyce of their spirituall and temporall pastors, without wandering or straying from their obedience, like lost sheepe, which growing wild, acknowledge not any shepheard. This third
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7338:44"/>
estate is diuided into the nobler sort, including as well ministers and magistrats <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> immediat and mediate vnder God, and the king as the commons and folke: out of which are framed all inferior politicke corporations, trades, and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as I partly touched in these Morals before. From those three, the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, reasonable, and absolute bodies of all Commonweales are deriued, their soules being drawne from the perfect and authenticall religion, deliuered and approued in sacred Scriptures; which hold mens hearts in loue, feare, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and obedience vnto God, to their princes, and towards all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This soule ought (as I haue partly declared in the Morals of my third booke) like iustice equally to peize it selfe, without wauing either to the right or to the left hand, further than is warranted by the written word, vttered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from Gods holy spirit by the mouths of all our Patriarchs, the Prophets, and Apostles. This is the mightiest and most excellent charge, which rideth vpon the wings of euery good kings soule, presenting him sanctified and without blemish before the precious throne of God.</p>
            <p>The king gouerning and preseruing in peace and good order those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and people, which are by Gods blessed ordinance laid vnder his scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is properly called the head of this bodie, beeing the noblest member thereof, and placed in the toppe, containing that rich treasure of all the sences, exterior and interior: as of imagination, vnderstanding, memorie, and common sence; whereas all other members, beeing subiect and obedient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thereunto, be partakers of touch onely. It likewise giueth liuely faculties to the whole bodie, as the Spring head doth to those other riuers which are naturally deriued from it. And therefore euery body without a head wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his life and sence: whereas though it want both legges and armes, it may liue and haue his being, though lame and miserable. In like sort, all waters not abounding from a Spring, are fennes, pooles, and marishes, mortified and without motion: whereas if diuerse armes and riuers braunching from the head, were taken away, yet would a liuely facultie remayne alwayes in the Spring. And therefore the best Philosophers and Physitions, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> and <hi>Auicenne,</hi> accord herein, that all sence and motion beginneth in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the braine: which being temperate, maketh a good memory, which is gotten by quietnesse, by which the memorie groweth rich with knowledge. In such similitude and order all the perfect sences and motions of the Commonwealth begin in the prince; who being temperate in himselfe, shall attaine that rich wise memorie (which is by the Morallists and sage Poets called very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the mother of their nine Muses) and thereby, like king <hi>Salomon,</hi> become perfect in all sapience and prudence. This match is made by tranquilitie: for so much as the zealous care and studie to purchase peace, maketh euery king blessed and reuerend, and in the presence and sight of God, and of his people. Out of which the glorious renowne, honour, and good memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of euery vertuous prince groweth famous in the knowledge of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie for euer: euen as for their golden gouernment, king <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Octauius Augustus</hi> were; whose glorie shall endure with this worlds me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</p>

Successiuely the liuer, being nurse of that bloud, which from thence in great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> conduits issueth, and is through little veins and pipes decently distributed vnto the members of that bodie, resembleth the princes treasure. This beeing bred and nourished in euery part (as it correspondently feedeth and nourisheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe) doth harmoniously keepe this politick body liuely and in health, each member according to nature, in his seuerall functions imparting comfort to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: as in the prince to retaine the tranquilitie of his subiects, appeareth by beneuolent retribution and dispensation of their subsidies, for their vniuersall prosperitie. In this alike as sapience or intelligence gouerneth in the heart, so doth the loue of mony in the liuer, <hi>Cogit enim amare iecur,</hi> For the liuer procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth loue in creatures. And euen by how much the more bloud encreaseth in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the body, so much the more lust moueth in the members, which aptly consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with that old Poeticall prouerbe, <hi>Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa pecunia crescit:</hi> The loue of money doth as much encrease as the money doth.</p>
            <p>Also the lungs I compare vnto lawes; because from thence, as <hi>Auicen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> write, all organes of the voice are drawne, according to the saying, <hi>Pulmo loquitur,</hi> The liuer giueth speech: for the law is not improperly called <hi>Oraculum Reipub.</hi> lying next vnto the liuer and heart of the Commonwealth: which ought to be kept incorrupt, because it is so full of pipes, as by the least contageon and putrifaction therein, the same wil infect &amp; endanger the whole bodie: and when those pipes are stopped, the spirit of life &amp; mouing is extinct, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so that the body perisheth.

And hence are those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Iudges which interprete those laws called Prudents and Sages, whose sentences haue formerly retained the same force that lawes ratified, as is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beginning of my third booke. The head, which is the rich treasure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of these lawes being resembled vnto the prince purely and precisely, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributeth and interpreteth all difficulties, according to the direction of Gods blessed grace and diuine spirit, which worketh in his conscience, guiding him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the way of truth with all innocencie and sinceritie: so that he will not suffer any thing to proceed from his iudgement and heart, in counterfeisance or any verball formalitie to blind and deceiue the simpler sort, &amp; to satisfie the present impositions of his owne appetite, as that wicked Florentine secretarie did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise princes: but it must proceed from a sincere and iust heart, which is liberall of the knowledge of equitie, with which God hath enriched his heart, for the weale of his people, according to <hi>Architas</hi> the Pythagorean: <hi>Bonum non sempèr</hi>

            <p>Out of that head, this heart, that liuer, and these lungs, are composed those liberall Artists and Philosophers, which in and by them are cherished in euery politicke body, such as are instructed in Schooles, Colledges, and Academies.</p>

The loynes and thighes I resemble not vnfitly to the true Nobilitie; vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whom for their vertues meerely such honours are by the prince diuolued: fortifying and ennobling euery kingdome with their monuments and poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: according to the precise estimate and attribute of true honour, which is (as it were) a due reuerence <hi>bestowed vpon persons in testimoniall of their vertue, or an externall token of the Princes, or of the peoples good opinion of him that is honoured:</hi> being Essentiall and Subiectiue, in respect of the person which imparteth honour; Materiall and Obiectiue, regarding him that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth honour.</p>
            <p>The ribbes, bulke, and other baser entrailes may bee likened to the folke and meaner yeomanrie, which guard and impale those estates, being called <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the bodie, which according to Philosophie (being composed of that earthly kind of beginnings) serueth as a certaine vessell or receptacle of the mind: or rather more properly the prison or sepulchre of those other excellent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall perfections, which contaminate and infect them with a grosse conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, darkening, or obumbrating those intellectuall faculties with pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations and deformities.

            <p>Lastly, the two legges which support the whole substance of all this little world, are honest merchandise, and tillage, or husbandrie. Merchandise consisteth in honest traffique, and barter, in exchange, in exportation, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> importation of lawfull goods, from and to places, lawfull and authorized by the commerce and intercourse of Nations, in league confederated with them, and by permission of their prince: which kind of mercature is fitly likened to the legge, because it is exercised in trauell and seruice of the body to bring in that good, which may supplie towards the generall benefite thereof. Hence was it, that the Philosophicall Poets fained <hi>Mercurius</hi> with wings at his feete, whome they tearme the God of guile and merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.</p>
            <p>There are three kinds of commerce: Mercature, Vsurie, and Mercenarie mysteries: the noblest of which is Mercature. Of Vsur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The lawes of nature as I said teach vs how pleasant and consonant it is with the spirit of life, that all members accord in affection and mutuall aide one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another.

For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that the labour should succeede well, when some kicke with their heeles, when they should haue drawne with their heads, making a distraction so much more violent through their disobedience, by how much more force there is in them that are so distracted: and from hence breaketh out the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and confusion of all good gouernment and policie: which answereth to the saying of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Omne regnum in se diuisum desolabitur:</hi> Euery kingdome diuided in it selfe becommeth desolate.

This happie marriage of those two beneuolent planets portendeth the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> weale of Christendome: for in it by a double vnion twice vnited in bloud: once by the sacred vnion of the two royall families of Yorke and Lancaster, and after by that second vnion in marriage, of a daughter and a sonne; that a mother, and this a father, both of them out of the bodies of king <hi>Henry</hi> and Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> is this match made betwixt <hi>Hengyst</hi> and <hi>Scota,</hi> more firme than euer at the first, when <hi>Brutus</hi> raigned ouer them, before their separation in the persons of <hi>Locryn</hi> and <hi>Albanact: Iam non sunt duo, sed caro vna.</hi> Which sacred circumscription was figured and stamped in a peece of coyne of your late royall parents, vpon their vnion, figuratiuely presaging this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

            <p>Since therefore these nations thus coupled in one bodie, be both of them knit vp in your Maiesties royall person and posteritie, there is not any doubt, but that they will liue, loue, and accord in sincere vnitie together, perfecting and accomplishing that generall peace of conscience, which was begun and yet continued from the first of your Maiesties late dearest sister her beginning in reigne, euen to this instant, of your gracious gouernment: your Highnesse representing the person of this auncient Brittaine, comprehending the new spouse Scotland within your princely bodie (though your royall residence be kept with vs, as in the bride-groomes chamber) hath that vbiquitie by God graunted you, touching the ciuile supremacie which his omnipotencie retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ouer all creatures. For though your Grace (being head) doe not really touch certaine parts of your Commonwealths bodie, yet that power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which is contained in your heart, liuer, and lungs, doth gouerne and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in those places, by direction of that head, which commaundeth and predominateth all the members: insomuch, as they neede not say, that the bridegroome is taken from them, and that they shall fast, because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse with him in power, feasting with vs vnder his goodnesse: for wee bee children of the bride-chamber all alike. And it is not to bee doubted, but that this new bride will declare her true loue and loyall demeanure towards her husband, whatsoeuer sedicious or malecontented spirits mistrust or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conster: for shee is from the first bud of her youth acquainted with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hauing a perfect and infallible notice by long tryall, and hath sincerely plighted her faith.

Howbeit, had I said onely, that this vnitie standeth best with the will and wisedome of God (from whence Entheusiastically beameth a diuine vertue to the prudence of all good princes, receiuing their ghostly consolation from him, and by the weale of his people) which plentifully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth vpon them through the spirit of faithfull prayers, and is sucked into their soules by the sighes of their louing feare of God: or had I said that which I could easily proue by politicke likelyhoods, how within the reuolution of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> one hundred yeares, the whole world (by this gordian knot, which <hi>Alexander</hi> himselfe could not, if hee were aliue, breake; being once surely knit in our hearts by a generall and faithfull consent) might bee made tributarie to this Monarchie, if the Brittaines would continue their loue so long towards God, and amongst themselues: then must it haue followed vpon necessitie, that the chiefe temporall weale of your Maiesties people, and a speciall meane vnto their spirituall consolation, might bee locked vp in this mysticall vnion. So that some in their loue towards God; others in regard of that glorious calme at home; diuerse in desire and hope of more reputation and riches, euen all of them for some one or other speciall affection or passion in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, which they would haue satisfied, might ioyfully giue to this vnion (by your Highnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so graciously composed) a generall approbation &amp; consent, for their vniuersall honour and content.</p>
            <p>Now turning to the Morals of Prudence, where I left, I would speake somewhat summarily, respecting the conditions of magistrats, souldiors, and artificers in a Commonwealth. I deeme him worthie to bee reputed a good Commonwealths man, that being garnished with ciuile vertues (as with iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and fortitude, which are in themselues moderated with prudence and temperance) can as well in forraine places, and in the warres, as in domesticall and ciuile affaires, performe the parts of a noble citizen and countreyman. All <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ingenuous youth therefore ought well and painefully to be taught and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the liberall Sciences, and exercise of Armes; to which purpose, schooles for Sciences liberall and palestricall are principally needefull in euery well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned estate. These things are semblably required in the consideration of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery prudent Magistrate: that he see the Lawes obserued; Religion with all reuerence embraced; Peace and Concord retained amongst citizens; all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of discord and faction extinguished; that each man bee diligent in his lawfull profession; that no man entermeddle with the State and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, before he be called to that dignitie; that Tributes and Subsidies bee duly payed; that euery man aduenture his life and substance in difficult sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for the preseruation and safegard of his country; that strangers in league with their Commonwealth, vse their owne seuerall trades and mysteries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues, without losse and impeachment; and that they bee not inquisitiue or ouer-curious in matters of that State where they liue; but that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7338:54"/>
a vigilant eye be cast vpon them, to discerne of their behauiours and honesties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> towards all persons, without intermeddling in any matters aboue their trades or professions, vehemently to defend the Church, to prescribe such orders (when occasion shall require) as may consent with the lawes, and times neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie: and lastly, that those of this Counsell and all other magistrates their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors behaue themselues according to the state and worth of their places and Offices, in a decent, court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e and victuall, with armour, and artillerie, against the dayes of famine and warre; to prepare charitably for the poore and afflicted persons within their cities and countries, that they perish not through want of foode, but that poore impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent people be relicued at all times in hospitals, in spittle houses; and (in times of pestilence) that the poore artificers also, which are not able to maintaine themselues without worke, but are restrained at home, may bee relieued by the support and exhibition of the richer sort, in those parishes where they reside or soiourne. Also, that at other times, the poore able and healthfull bodies be set vnto conuenient labor and businesse, according to their strength <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and cunning. Moreouer, that strangers and trauellers from forraine parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confederate, and in amitie with their state, be receiued and entertained, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to their worth and degrees (and for the credite and good report of their Nation) with all liberall hospitalitie. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth, <hi>Est Reipub. ornamento, homines externos hospitalitate in vrbe nostra non egere:</hi> It is a grace to our Commonwealth, when forrainers are not destitute of entertainment and hospitalitie within our citie. And lastly, that their whole care and studie bee bent to maintaine the reputation of that Common-wealth, where they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne vnder their prince. And for as much as it is one speciall part of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and of good policie, that euen in the most peaceable times, militarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> preparation and prouision be made: as the wise Oeconomicall father, which in the most foison and heat of his haruest will store vp carefully for the cold and barren season of Winter: so is it required in those magistrats of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, that (vpon suddaine assaults and warning) they bee carefull, and readie with competent force to resist all forraine malice and ambition; howbeit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely to consult before they leuie warre. If a prince without shamefull and dishonourable inustion cannot auoyde battaile, then with great caution to resist the common aduersarie, hauing the captaines and souldiors readily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and trayned to fight, with a noble valour and constancie: which also must in time of peace be with sound deliberation, and vpon iust tearmes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> likewise a warie prouision and speciall notice of such as for their strength and sufficiencie may lead and commaund souldiors. Moreouer, that in tranquilitie (through each dominion or prouince of the Commonwealth within the reuolutions of three yeares) a generall view or muster bee taken of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7338:54"/>
those persons which are most able for militarie seruices; and that a strict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be made as well of all militarie furniture, and priuate armour, as of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, throughout the dominions: that beeing conferred diligently with the muster-rolles of euery Shire or Countie, the perfect force of men &amp; arms may be conferred and knowne: and that (if any defect be found in either) a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent preparation and supply may be made; and that (whilest yet matters are in quiet) valiant and well approued captaines exercise the sufficientest of euery prouince within their seuerall townes, cities, and villages adiacent, once each weeke, or euery ten dayes, by trayning &amp; disciplining them in martiall practise at the common charge for their vniuersall honour and defence: also that ships be rigged, manned, armed, dieted, and prouided of captaines, saylers, souldiors, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> victuals, and artillerie, to resist all forraine inuasion or hostile preparations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: that treasure (which is truly called the sinews of war) be collected and instored for such purposes: that souldiors be taught order and obedience, hauing their wages iustly payed vnto them: and also that they be warned, and with seuere punishment prohibited, that they make no spoyle and bootie of them, in whose defence they professe and beare armes: which complaint hath beene old and vsuall amongst citizens and husbandmen in most places. Euery Counsellor therefore, and each other ciuile magistrate ought to be well instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and perfect in these militarie rudiments, which he shal with a little practise and paine taking (hauing read <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And whereas in euery Commonwealth there are three states or columnes supporting the same, (the first of ciuile Counsellors or Magistrats, the second of militarie Gouernors and Captaines, the third consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of arts and artificers of trades and mysteries) mee seemeth, that a captaine equalleth the ciuile magistrate, according to his place &amp; degree, defending and preseruing things in possession, euen as hee which attaineth, purchaseth, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilizeth the same. And so much hereof, considering I shal haue occasion more fully to discourse of this point in my fourth booke of Offices. Now somewhat concerning the opposites vnto this vertue, which I will touch briefely.</p>
            <p>Imprudence (being ignorance, or a want of power and counsell to make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> betwixt good and euill, or to giue a reasonable iudgement of any thing within vulgar apprehension) is the first opposition to prudence: and hence came it, that each vniust and intemperate person was deemed by the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers foolish and imprudent; as hauing no force in himselfe to gouerne his inordinat appetites to moderation. Giddinesse of the mind &amp; temeritie are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this vice: for imprudent persons through idlenesse &amp; negligence take no regard vnto their children and wiues, retaining no rule or discipline in their families: but if secret Counsellors and ciuile ministers, in office vnto states and princes, be possessed of this intollerable plague, then doe the people vnder their gouernance hold it tollerable for them to sinne with impunitie: as also, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Generals of armies are infected therewith, then do those souldiors vnder their charge wax slothfull: such as <hi>Scipi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> Aemilianus</hi> found at the seruice against Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia, whom he by fresh practise, discipline, and instruction restored to their natiue valours, formerly forgotten. Calliditie &amp; malicious wilines is that other
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7338:55"/>
extreame, which oppositely withstandeth prudence, by which vnaduised peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> are deceiued with the meere semblance and counterfeit of vertues: yea, men of good natures and disposition otherwise (whose minds surmount their present meanes) oftentimes depraue their honourable conditions with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall medicines, adulterating their true natures with fallacious imitation of time, place, person, and the necessitie, which is by them imposed. Hence is it, that our ancestors of former ages are so much extolled aboue vs of later times, in regard of their simple, plaine, and open dealing in all actions, according to the saying of <hi>Cicero: Non placuit maioribus nostris astus:</hi> Our Elders were not pleased with craftinesse. For in those times no lesse then with some of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest persons in these dayes guile was held most odious and abiect, eradicated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> either by legall vertue (which restraineth and punisheth the malicious deuices of men) or by Philosophie, which (through the force of reason and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence) banisheth it: <hi>Ratio namque postulat ne quid insidiosè, ne quid falentèr, ne quid simulat?</hi> For reason requireth vs to doe nothing which may bee treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, fallacious, or counterfeit. Subtilties therefore in priuate causes which do not concerne the Commonwealth, should specially bee suppressed in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Counsellors, and all such hypocriticall malice as counterfeiteth prudence to life, distanding so farre from it, as a man may shoot a rouing shaft of reason: for hee (that with all his strength laboureth to doe good) may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the name of a very wiseman, and become innocent, in respect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and others. But the true conclusion is that, <hi>Calliditas sapientia perfect a non</hi> 
               <note place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>est, nec honestas, quanquam species honestatis &amp; sapientia esse potest, &amp;c.</hi> That calliditie is no perfect sapience, nor honestie, although it seeme both wise and honest. Wee should therefore take great care, least those vices deceiue vs, which in outward apparance resemble vertues: for the least wauering eyther to the right or left hand is vicious; let vs therefore ponder our selues in the middest. Ignorance in this, and in the knowledge of the limits, lists, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (within which vertues and vices consist) seduceth very many, bringing them into the number of those ideots, whose reason is adumbrated.

            <p>And hence groweth that generall mis-conceit, preiudication, and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of discretion, which cannot rightly measure mens natures by their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For example, when they call him a coward which desireth peace: if a man be subtle headed, then is hee trayterous: if simple, and a slothfull dastard, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> him they repute gentle: if vnskilfull in all commendable qualities, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from his owne lazie sluggishnesse, him they tearme simple and honest: if a man through the intemperate and irascible passion of wrath can onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer threatening rebukes, or opprobrious speeches, him they tearme a plaine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7338:55"/>
dealing man, whose mind and tongue (though both abhominable) accord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> without dissimulation: if in his pride hee beare himselfe aboue his place, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and birth, him the vulgar calleth magnificent: if he be furious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate of life and fortunes, him they thinke valiant: prodigall persons are estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med liberall; couetous and wretched fellowes, prouident, and frugall hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; supersticious and blockish people are taken for, and reported to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and holy persons: such as are truly learned and excellent schollers in all faculties, are censured (by them whose iudgements are not so suddaine as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, neither so malicious as thredbare) to bee curious fooles, arrogant, and opinionatiue. And thus is euery good and bad qualitie misconstrued with a reprobate glosse: but hereof I haue sufficiently spoken in my Preface. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a man will warily ponder, what things are required in him that aspireth vnto the toppe and perfection of all goodnesse: if he can so fashion and shape his owne affections generally; as in seeming, that he crediteth any mans say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whom he list to beleeue: if he can vse those honest blandishments, wilie complements, and needefull attributes, which can angle out the loue of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: <hi>Proprium enim virtutis est conciliare animos hominum &amp; ad suos vfus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iungere:</hi> For it is a vertuous qualitie, to conciliate mens minds, and to make his proper vse of them: if he can apprehend the plaine causes, which moue most honour and admiration in their hearts towards any Magistrates: if hee can wisely discerne the Spring-tide of Iustice, Prudence, Fortitude, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> (when they passe their bounders) then is he worthily deemed iudicious. In the consideration and practise of which, the whole force of prudence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.</p>
            <p>Peregrination of countries is another cheefe ornament in a Counsellor, in speciall the realmes and prouinces of his prince, his friends, his enemies, and neighbours. In such trauailes behooueth his care, prudence, diligence, and consideration: not to passe like those gaping and wauering fooles, in fayres and markers, which onely come to busie their eyes without benefite. But his vse of trauell must be, to know how such countries are gouerned in peace and warre: what reuenewes ordinarie out of his owne lands, and extraordinarie by contribution of the people, belong to the prince; how the realme is muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and how the people addicted: by such obseruation hee becommeth pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, worthie to be consulted, and in honourable respect vpon his returne. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> Emperours, supposed, that men ought not to diue into the secrets of a forraine state: yet he which (vpon the dispatch of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny legation) returneth into his owne countrey, shall be deemed prudent, if he can obserue &amp; open (when occasion is offered) such secrets as by being shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may profit his owne countrey. Amongst other things, if he bee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the prince to performe any great embasie, the speciall subiect of his heart vnder God must be the renowne of his prince, and the chiefe organe &amp; directorie, by which hee must square out his businesse and worke, should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> bee moderation. For if it happen that in arrogant speeches hee gallop out of the listes of modestie, then doth hee violate and abuse the maiestie and peace both of his prince and of the people. But rather if any thing in charge
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7338:56"/>
be by the king, through heate or some angry passion, somewhat more sharpe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> or bitterly deliuered; that when he pronounceth his Soueraignes message, the embassadour rather mollifie than exasperate any matters of litigious conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in his speech: and if other things of fauour or honour bee by him to be signified on behalfe of his prince vnto friends, his care ought to deuise, how he may make the same more gracious and magnificent by his owne wit and inuention: for it sometimes happeneth, that princes by means of some embassadours their intemperance and temeritie, be vehemently moued vnto wrath; and by the prudence of others are drawne into the true borders of friendship and amitie. The things commonly notable in trauelling of forraine countries, are the lawes, religion, and fashions of the Nation where hee so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourneth; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the scituation, castles, and cities of the countries; the fashions of the princes robes, and attire; the qualities, pedigrees, families, power, treasure, and buildings of the Counsellors and Noblemen. By conference (vpon such obseruation) he shall learne the good and euill of his owne countrey, how to ciuilize the people, if their manners be corrupt, how to declare himselfe hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable towards strangers: for vnder them haue diuers charitably disposed worldlings (such as <hi>Tobias</hi> and <hi>Lot)</hi> receiued Angels into their houses: how to grope mens minds or meanings, whether they bee friends or enemies; and according to the state of his businesse he shall accommodate himselfe to the time, and vnto the state of his prince, hauing good note of all occasions, opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> encombrances, and difficulties of places and seasons. No man shall haue power by cunning relation of salse-hood to make him swallow a gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, neither to build vpon any mans opinion. It is further required, that hee know how many myles that countrey where he hath conuersed, is in length; how many in breadth; with what munitions and artillerie the townes are fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; in what place of the countrey an armie may find safest entrance: what faire and open Harbours, Ports, Creekes, Hauens, and Promontories there are: how many deepe riuers water the countries; what the principall vertues and vices of the people bee; what their chiefest pleasure: wherein their Nobles differ from ours in England; what oddes betwixt their edifices, and ours: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> whether of the princes is in power most absolute; how the people in those Nations oppose their Soueraignes; what difference in the formes of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and ours: how they muster, trayne, and discipline souldiors: whether in marching or quartering of armies they spoyle the countreyman: what order is prouided, that the souldior shall not annoy the peasant. So that in his relation he may discreetly compare all those countries (where hee hath trauailed) with his owne, distinguishing of all properties with sound iudgement. For if distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be wanting, farewell election; and if that depart, prudence is also bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; the lacke wherof bringeth in confusion, which haleth on many millions of miseries. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
            </p>
            <p>A sound knowledge and apprehension of the princes strength whom hee serueth, with the power of his confederats, neighbours, and enemies, is likewise adioyned. This shall teach him how great their seuerall reuenewes are, eyther ordinarie, or extraordinarie, from whence, by what meanes, and when they be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7338:56"/>
gathered: what forces his prince can leuie, and how long maintaine them; how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> well disciplined; what gallant or caitiue captaines amongst them that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: which of them are confederat against the king; whose parties they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and vpon what plot of malecontment, reuenge, faction, ambition, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: how strong or weake those secret partisanes are; with what commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities they be furnished, and wherein wanting: for this is the ready rule which measureth any princes power. Hee should likewise of himselfe seeme able and worthie (when warres require the aduenture of his state and life) to bear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ouer many souldiors, and at all assayes so well appointed, as hee may be found <hi>aequè fortis ac prudens,</hi> both wise and valiant: executing the laws of arms (as those Romane Emperours, of whom it is written) That <hi>in castris</hi> they did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>agere iure summo, domique ex aequo &amp; bono:</hi> That in the warres they did vse martiall law, and at home in peace administer equitie.</p>
            <p>When a Counsellor can with sound knowledge like a good Physition heale the diseases of his countrey, prouiding how to preuent them, before they can take hold thereof, he magnifieth his wisedome vehemently: he should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heare euery man willingly, fauour all indifferently, yet so, that most respect be fastened to the iust cause. A stranger in his good dealing and right ought to bee preferred before a neighbour: wherefore if hee were a Iew borne, or barbarous Heathen, if he were a Turke, or of what odious off-spring soeuer, let his cause, not his qualitie be respected, and in equitie let him hold the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nation, cognation, countrey, citie, bloud, and familie with a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for so much as may concerne his cause. In this qualitie the Counsellor is importunately warned to take great heede, that hee with his parts doe not corroborate any faction, or vnder the pretext and robe of iustice reuenge pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate wrongs. Euen as dissentions amongst captaines further the stratagems of their enemies: so doe the disunions of Counsellors helpe them, against whom their Counsels are bent. The principall and most soueraigne medicine, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vsed, and most preuayling against the pestilence of dissention and enuie, by good experiment and knowledge, hath beene humanitie, and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>Iustice and goodnesse is no little estimation in a Counsellor, when his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings soothly consound with integritie, vertue, and veritie: here and there, in mouth and heart all one, in word and deede plaine, reprehending faults in others with all mildnesse and benignitie. His actions are throughly seasoned with beneuolence and courtesie: hee will not withhold his good counsell from any man: a patrone towards good persons, seuere against malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, in all places zealous of vertue, enemie to calumnies, detesting lyes and vanitie: no dissembler, no double-tongued person, no referendarie: for neuer was any delator of mens conditions and manners faithfull, but abiect and base minded. Moreouer, a iust man will not rebuke one, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absent, for his faults, if hee may haue him present: that which neyther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his eyes nor hands haue seene nor handled, he will not auouch, or vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. He cannot away with flatterers or tale-bearers: for hee thinketh with <hi>Tacitus,</hi> That Adulation is an euer-liuing euill; and with <hi>Curtius,</hi> who
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7338:57"/>
writeth, that people of such nature deuour and wast the princes treasure much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> more then enemies: and therefore it is written in the life of <hi>Constantine</hi> the sonne of <hi>Constantius,</hi> that he called those flatterers and enuches of the court, which wast the Commonwealth, and yet are alwayes murmuring, mothes and water rats: like those dogges of which the blessed prophet saith, That they run grudging and grinning about the citie for meate, vntill they bee satisfied, whose gluttonous appetite is bottomlesse &amp; insatiable. <hi>Nero</hi> who was brought vp in temperance and sobrietie, through flatterers became cruell: through them <hi>Caesar</hi> lifted his arme against his owne countrey; from them aspired the tyrannies of <hi>Rhoboham.</hi> But it is needlesse to produce forraine example, being well furnished with domesticall testimonies: for wee read and know, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> second <hi>Edward</hi> of Carnaruan, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Blacke princes sonne, one and the other were deposed and confounded by the fruit of that viletie which they sucked from flatterers. A sage and honourable Councell therefore will fence his eares against the subtilties of them, least <hi>Sinon</hi> enter with the Troiane horse, and there vnrip his packe of parasites, which wildly seising vpon his hart will tyrannously vsurpe vpon his soule also. This is a whoorish danger, which first allureth, then bindeth, and being once tied, it is almost impossible for the captiued to get loose. They therefore that respect their owne quiet with the princes honour, wil esteeme more of one <hi>Clitius,</hi> than of six hundred <hi>Aristippi;</hi> for they present vnto such noble magistrats in precious vessels, that potion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which intoxicatcth their imaginations, vnderstandings, and memories, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in with it the Commonwealths bane and ouerthrow: euen as in a most sententious Tragedie was written by <hi>Seneca.</hi>

            <p>Liberalitie likewise is a very gracious ornament, seemely befitting a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor: this, since I did handle in the first Booke of these Offices, entreating of Treasurers, I will speake lesse in this place: onely this, it is a principall baite to take people, because aboue all things they loue to sport themselues in those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> siluer waues, or vnder the golden grauell, delighting in the sweetenesse of it.

This is not spoken, that a man should be so beastly minded, as to scrape or restraine liberalitie, when esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and honour offer themselues by reasonable expences, but onely to vse a bridle in vaine, and vnnecessarie disbursements.

            <p>Charitie with bountie (such as <hi>Polybius</hi> prescribed to <hi>Scipio)</hi> magnifieth a Counsellor, to make so good vse of his going abroad at all times, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite some before his returne home: for euen as couetousnesse is the roote <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of all euill, so beneficence and charitie bee the well-springs of all goodnesse. Angelicall and humane eloquence, the gift of prophecying, the secret and vnreuealeable knowledge of all mysteries, a faith retaining power to mooue mountaines, are all of no force, if they be not illumined with charitie: hee which giueth all his possessions to the poore, which sacrificeth his body to the fire or sword, meriteth not without charitie. Hee which is espoused to that beautifull nymph, is patient, bountifull, without mallice, ostentation, pride, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, selfe-loue, wrath, euill thought: for shee reioyceth, and is inwardly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished with confolation in truth, faith, hope, patience, and perseuerance: shee, <note place="margin">Corinth. 1. cap. 13</note> when prophecies, tongues, and knowledge shall cease, and bee consummated, can neuer be consumed, but liueth immortally: of those three sweete sisters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of grace and heauenly benediction, charitie (being the last after faith &amp; hope) is the chiefest, sayth that diuine Organe of eloquence, blessed <hi>Paule,</hi> couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">Rom. cap. 13.</note> and malice are her open and professed enemies.

            <p>Beneficence being a promptnesse to deserne well, is (as I said before) a kind of liberalitie required in Counsellors: which consisteth in the aduancement of the Commonwealths profite; in admonishing, commending, reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, comforting, procuring, defending, not onely requiring ayde and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> but by vettue deseruing the same. It is a beneficence to see, that the high wayes and bridges be made and repaired, to relieue poore people, villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or societies, by crosse fortune or misaduenture distressed or oppressed: and (as <hi>Cicero</hi> noteth) <hi>Benignitas est Reipub. vtilis redimi à seruitute captos, locu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletari tenuiores, &amp;c.</hi> It is a benignitie commodious to the Commonwealth, <note place="margin">Off. lib. 2.</note> that captiues bee ransomed from bondage, and that the poorer sort may bee relieued with riches. Such was that vertuous beneficence of the Emperour <hi>Titus,</hi> who when Rome for three dayes &amp; three nights continually did burne, and that a grieuous famine with mortalitie chanced amongst the people, with his owne priuate purse relicucd multitudes of them; to many sicke persons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ministring physicke himselfe, and visiting diuers which were discomfited vpon the death of their friends, performing this in his owne person.

did in my first booke) so do I necessarile record it againe in this part, that base <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ministers, &amp; vnder petty pursers, which geld, and curtall the princes bounties and beneficences, should be strictly and seuerely obserued &amp; punished in such cases: which beastly dishonor here in England our late most renoumed Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> could neuer endure, but vpon any complaint approued, did cause to be seuerely censured. It is likewise a gracious beneficence, to be mercifull &amp; charitable towards Churches, Almeshouses, &amp; Hospitals; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging such as are vertuous and commendably qualified with good testimony giuen of their vertues &amp; good partes vnto the prince; &amp; in furthering of their preserment at his hands. Such a counsellour protecteth iustice, defendeth the people, guardeth the nobilitie, patronizeth his countreymen, adorneth the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> prince: and indeed sanctifieth him vpon earth. Gentlenesse &amp; benignitie may not be forgotten in him towards people of all degrees &amp; fashion, as in cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full giuing of eare with diligence and attention to their desires &amp; petitions: in answeres beneuolent; and in promise of offices serious and graue; in denying, nothing supercilious, in rebukes nothing iniurious, in dismission of suitors, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proud nor peremptory: such a man (when the prince extendeth grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any) doth pretend it to be twise so much as it was; comforting the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, &amp; honoring the soueraigne. If a petioner be frustrated, he doth beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, curtously, with very good words, &amp; in plaine honesty content him: such behauiour is much more effectuall, then gold. Bountifulnesse, affabilitie, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vigilancie, with diligence appeare in him; his apparell is honest, graue, and neat; his delight is in companie; he cannot away with factions, and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he disdaineth no mans familiaritie, neither doth he wrong any man in bitter speeches; he delighteth in argute, &amp; witty sayings, louing honest liberty, loathing ostentation with hypocrisie. Fortitude deseruing speciall respect in a counsellor is only ment by the interior vertue; which may be termed he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall valor: here of more at large, &amp; substantially my purpose is to treat in my fourth booke. Such therfore are sincerely studious of vertue, that with a mind aspiring celestiall honors, contemplate happily, contemning those passions &amp; affections, which other men hold precious; as hatred; fauor, wealth, pouertie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ease, labor, life or death; but liue well satisfied with their present estate, whither it be good or bad. His mind is neither broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor disturbed; measuring himselfe by the cube of reason: wherfore (well knowing how suddenly time wil slip) he will not omit any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable occasions to serue his honest purposes; but as occasion shall gallop necre him, so wil he warily catch hold of her bridle: bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counsailing, speaking, &amp; aswering to the prince &amp; people as he thinketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; he cannot be corrupted; &amp; detesteth for mony; friendship, consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, prayer, or feare, to deale vniustly: he defendeth the truth, offendeth flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. In all actions, consultations, &amp; iudgments seuere, and constant, a professed enemy to talebearers, bold in discharging his conscience, graue in speech, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> superstitious, neither dissembling in heart toward prince or priuatperson: his honesty wil not suffer him to deceiue, his wisdom wil not brooke to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: his valor maketh him triumph ouer many calamities, &amp; tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; his honor worketh towards him reuerence in the eyes &amp; hearts of all the people.

By such Counsellors therefore, euery prince and euery state is strengthened <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and supported, both at home and abroad: for his owne subiects will willingly serue him, and forrainers stand in awe of his vertues: so shall the prince bee generally magnified.</p>

The first died very rich, in a most healthfull state of soule, and in honour of his countrey; which was for many yeares sustained, comforted, and protected by his prudence: the second, both in true pietie, iustice, and glorie, respecting God and the Commonwealth; honorable, and truly rich, which was in mentall perfections, and in the loue of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> (which he so much loued) onely.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There is one vertuous condition which must inseparably be fastned, placed, or rooted rather in a Counsellor; and it is a pure will, godly zeale, and ioyfull promptnesse to giue sound and wholesome counsell, (of which I spake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before) as when things be by mature deliberation consulted, before they be peremptorily resolued vpon, and all the causes (with euen hand) first weighed in the ballance of iustice. A Senator therefore (which retaineth so reuerende and honourable office) must respect the ground of his authoritie, which doth <hi>best and most to life anatomize a magistrate.</hi> Sodaine and doubtfull counsels do digest more happily with them, that are sildome vexed with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and difficulties; or with ambitious persons which onely respecting their priuate glory, feare least time of deliberation will grow scant vnto them; then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with such Commonwealths as (being placed vpon the maine toppe of all power and authoritie) can leisurely tarry for a fit time and occasion. In anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or doubtfull matters therefore they choose such a course as most behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and least endangereth: yet hath it been commonly seene in giuing of counsell, that the vulgar attribute all to the Counsellors prudence and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, if fortune fauour the euent; but if otherwise, then is he condemned in the contrary. And hence is it, that the meede of good Counsellors is often ascribed to fortune, and fortunes serenitie attributed to good counsell. If the businesse in hand be very weightie, the counsellors (which handle it) must be very warie, and such things (as cannot admit a recorrection, or reconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> must be with good discretion deliberated.</p>
            <p>There is likewise one excellent part in wise and compleate Counsellors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which is to giue good eare and attention to the sayings of all men vttered vnto him; and in speciall to those of that societie, which though inferior or superior in their places speake before them. Herein a Counsellor must muster his wittes together, and remember those arguments wherwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they confirme and corroborate their seuerall opinions, that (when his tourne inuiteth him to speach) he may not misse a mite in recapitulation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of any materiall pointes. Hence was it that <hi>Pericles</hi> (convening with <hi>Sophocles</hi> his fellow Pretor concerning State-businesse (vpon <hi>Sophocles</hi> his commendation of the beautie of a very faire Boy passing by) earnestly repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>It is not only fit to withhold your hands, but to withdraw your eyes from such vaine obiects in these serious cases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:7338:60"/>
For these respects <hi>Lycurgus</hi> inhibited all manner of pictures from the chamber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of consultation; least the Senatours eyes being withdrawne from serious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations and obseruations, might (by looking vpon them) forget somewhat to the preiudice of the present seruice.</p>
            <p>Deliberation also <hi>(being a diligent and prudent meditation of things future, doubtfull, and contingent, remayning in our power; by which choice is made of the best meanes to good and happie successe in any thing that may be done or spoken)</hi> is one speciall type of a Counsellors prudence. Which some compare to the Mulberrie, that flourishing last of all trees, yeeldeth ripe fruit before others: for after sound consultation matters are with expedition acted. Neither may counsell be profered, before the king require it, like a vaine physition, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> will intrude himselfe before hee bee sent for, vnlesse some speciall causes to himselfe onely knowne, and in matters of great weight he find it most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie: for there be three fashions of counselling, by Reason, by good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, by faithfull example: which three concurring, are of most validitie. If a Counsellor therefore yeeld not vnto the votes and suffrages of any thing, propounded by whatsoeuer persons: first, let him arme himselfe in good proofe, tempered with the steele of reason, to maintaine the contrarie parts more conueniently: and for so much as it standeth him in hand to confute their opinions; and that very few with due moderation can haue patience to bee conuinced: let him vse all temperance and mildnesse of speech, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> may bee, without contention: for it sufficeth a worthie Counsellor (let others thinke at their pleasure) to satisfie his priuate conscience.</p>
            <p>If memorie likewise doe not by nature richly supplie to the Counsellors reading: for so much as it is fitly called the Register of eloquence, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Muses, it will be much behoofefull, that a Counsellor studie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himselfe by that art industriously, which by maps, characters, or Hyero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphickes may be best placed.</p>
            <p>Knowledge in the studies of Morall and Naturall Philosophie, being first well grounded with Logicall rules, that he may probably discourse &amp; dispute wisely (when any question vpon good occasion requireth) is needefull also. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The Philosophie which <hi>Plato</hi> defineth in one of his Epistles, is constancie, faithfulnesse, and sinceritie. Which tripartite kind is by the Morallists called the art of Sapience: for it teacheth vs the knowledge of God, it reclaymeth vs to fortitude and modestie; which illuminating our minds, consumeth those mystie vapours of ignorance and dulnesse, that oppresse our reason; so that we may clearely behold things aboue vs, about vs, and beneath vs: it roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out vice, harrowing the mind, and making it fit to receiue the seede of all good knowledge; without which mans nature is wounded, and miserable. They which studie these arts, are properly called <hi>Prudentes:</hi> For Philosophie is by interpretation the studie of knowledge, being the perfection of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> skill, and altogether necessarily to bee studied and sought for by princes and great magistrates. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth: <hi>Philosophia est fructuosa, nulla pars eius inculta atque deserta:</hi> Philosophie is fruitfull, no part of which is vnmanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">Offic. 3.</note> or desert. The most profitable part whereof, consisteth in mentall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

and Morals. Onely by the Physickes we learne the nature of things, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Nature which natureth, and the Nature natured; the diuers qualities of them both: from whence those bodies are, which wee call elements, lightenings, thunder, fierie impressions, rainebow, tempests, earth-quakes, inundations of waters; from what naturall causes they proceede.

Both Diuines and Philosophers consent, that this inferiour world is (according to the discretion and disposition of God) gouerned by the heauens: so that these inferior bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ruled and moued by power of the superior. And hence is that saying of <hi>Aristotle: Necessario mundum hunc inferiorem superioribus motibus esse conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guum, vt omnis eius virtus inde gubernetur:</hi> It must of necessitie be, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> world neighboureth the superiour powers and motions, to the end, the force and vertue thereof might bee gouerned, and disposed from aboue.

This art, as well for the rule of Nauigation (which proceedeth from knowledge of the celestiall bodies) as for those other secrets, issuing out of the mysticall indicials of the Mathematicians, is more precious to them that haue it, than any worldly felicitie: for so much as they commonly (which are possessed thereof) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne all transitorie pleasures and glorie. Wherefore, that noble Poet <hi>Virgil</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> concerning that nature of the Planets, writeth thus:</p>

Hence was it that <hi>Socrates</hi> excused the Philosopher, which (according to Physiognomie) condemned him of incontinence. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, sometimes they will (vpon their coniecturals) diuine very neere and oftentimes truly: for the confirmation whereof, I will cite one notable thing, which I did reade in <hi>Cassanans</hi> the Burgundian. To whome, beeing at <note place="margin">In 10 parte Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogi glor. mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di consid. 52.</note> supper with the <hi>Confallionere di guisticia in Milan</hi> (vpon occasion in discourse) it was for a meere truth by diuerse affirmed, That a famous Astrologer in that citie had presaged to <hi>Giouanni Galliaceo maria Viscomi,</hi> the fifth Duke of that State, how he should be mortally wounded by some vassale about him: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the Duke, demaunding of his owne fate, his answere was: <hi>My death must be publicke, by the fall of a peece of timber.</hi> But the Duke willing to preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or antiuert the fate (by some other suddaine death denounced against the Mathematician) gaue peremptorie sentence, That hee should loose his head, because he had entermeddled with the calculation of his natiuitie. And as he was conducted to the place of execution, from the port of a Tower vnder which he passed (called <hi>Le Dome)</hi> suddenly the top thereof fell downe, and he with a piece of timber had his braines crusht out: a multitude with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallioniere,</hi> and other executioners in the companie, were by that ruine slaine also. Likewise, the Duke himselfe that same yeare vpon Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the great Church of <hi>San Stephano in Milan,</hi> was by one of his slaues bloudily and cruelly butchered in the presence of many Noblemen, and others.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude with the Morall force of Philosophie, which as <hi>Plato</hi> did esteeme, was the chiefest blessing in any Commonwealth; <hi>When Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were Kings, and Kings Philosophers:</hi> For it reacheth the difference betwixt vertues and vices, what are the extreames of good and euill, how to rule priuat families, what authorities and offices belong to fathers, husbands, and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; the difference betwixt instruments, hauing life and liuelesse; the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of priuate persons, the vertues and discipline of magistrates, the best <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> formes of gouernment, the true meanes and knowledge to sustaine cities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in danger of subuersion, and how with excellent lawes to rectifie them: Hence is it, that <hi>Cicero</hi> doth (in admiration and great loue thereof) proclaime in his questions Tusculane. <hi>O Philosophie, the rule of life, the touch-stone of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> wholly relie vpon their owne vertues, yeelding honour to such as are in grace with the prince, yet not committing any priuate secrets to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and iudgements.

            <p>There remaineth one speciall Caueat after all these obseruations for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors (which through their worthinesse and vertues haue attained a singular loue &amp; affiance of their Prince, to be credited and vsed in all the most serious &amp; important causes of the Commonwealth) which is; that, neither the great grace of their princes, nor the multitudes of honors and superiorities heaped vpon them; neither any vaine gaping vpon the popular aire (after which men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> growne insolent vpon their greatnesse commonly breathe) driue them into practises ambitious; which are through want of due pietie towards God and to their Soneraigne, without any season of iustice, or honestie commenced.

Their nefarious captaines impiously darting those vertues and graces (giuen vnto them by God, and headed with the venomous forkes of ambition and malice) vpon the naked breastes of their natiue contries; whose minds (incessantly troubled) breath fourth in pestilent sighes, in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> execrations, in blasphemous oathes, and in vaineglorious menaces, a sudden death against all good men.

Certaine it is therefore which <hi>Cicero</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out of <hi>Dicaearchus</hi> the Peripatetike. <hi>Homines hominum impetu plures deleri; id est bellis &amp; seditionibus &amp;c. quam reliqua calamitate.</hi> More men by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of men (which is by warre, seditions, and rebellious treasons) are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, then with any other calamitie.

Euery right noble and vertuous counsellor therefore will labour, (as <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth) to deliberate in such cases, whether they should wittingly become honest, in auoyding that which they know to be reasonable; or whether they should wilfully become wicked in the toppe of traytorie.

Needfull hath God in his wisedome seene, that there should be treasons, but woe be to those that execute them: it had been good for them, that they neuer had quickened in the seed of man. For no sooner hath the father punished his children with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> those vngracious twigges, but in a tender compassion he casteth them into the fire, and some-times burneth the rod before it be vsed; because his wrath shall not continue still against his, which if a little while it might endure (after once it were kindled) what mortall man were able to brooke the smart thereof?</p>
            <p>There is one ambitious rule, which the Machiuilian politicks haue taught <note place="margin">Vide cap. 17. princ. Nic.

But the wisest Philosophers teach vs, that it is base and vulgar to thirst after soueraigntie; meaning, that ambition cannot seaze vpon a verie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and magnanimious heart. Besides royall burthen is accompanied with a most seruile vexation, care, continuall feare, with treason, &amp; perill. Hence was it that <hi>Aecius</hi> the <hi>Comoedian</hi> concluded how <hi>few princes were honest and faithfull,</hi> either because no princes in his time did beare any soueraignetie but tyrannes: or else because hee deemed in his vaine opinions, that without some sinister and crooked meanes, kings could not retaine their principalities; which <hi>Cicero</hi> to this effect distinguisheth, as if the Comoedian had onely ment <note place="margin">Offic. 3.</note> it by licencious, and tyrannous kings whose ends are commonly like their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernements. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Such were the ancient tyrans of <hi>Greece</hi> that durst not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad out of their pallaces; least some good man in killing of them might emancipate the Commonwealth.

            <p>It resteth now that I declare the bodily tokens and complections which are obserued by some special writers in choise of a counsellor: for as in al weighty matters, it is euident amongst wise men, that great iudgement and obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is vsed; so should it appeare much rather in a matter of such speciall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as this is; for so much as vpon these counsellors the wealth and health of princes and principalities depend. By these exterior properties, much may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> gathered of the interior faculties before declared (as <hi>Ceriolano</hi> thinketh) albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they doe not hold generally certaine; for coniecturals are as notes or signes, which may sometimes deceiue; and yet not to be reiected neither: For (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other Philosophers write) their are markes and accidents or signes in mens bodies figuring their priuate affections. In some beautifull persons, there is a kind of venerable maiestie. A comely countenance and pleasing face, greatly graceth a counsellor; yeelding good correspondence to his dignitie. Hence was it that <hi>Socrates</hi> did preferre before all others beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full persons to the studies of Philosophie; supposing that this outward pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude did represent to life the picture of diuine beautie. And albeit some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> within a sower countenance, a most beautifull nature is planted, and a right excellent knowledge, mind, and iudgement within a bodie not absolute in composition and membrature; yet is it very rare to be seene: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much the more rarely such persons are found, so much more excellent and rare, are their interior vertues &amp; perfections, if we compare them with others in their natures, being intended here to that beautie, which <hi>Cicero</hi> doth ascribe vnto dignitie and not to comely colour: considering how the true pulchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is interior; whereas in effeminate and affected beautie nothing is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. For if we consider it, Nature her selfe being prouided of a competent force, placeth her most arte and studies in fashioning of the braine, which (as I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> said) is the principall seate of our reasonable soule. And hence it is, that some men which in other members seeme foule and deformed, yet prooue to bee most prudent and of admirable fine wits. It was written by diuers Hystorians, that amongst barbarous and wilde people, the visible beautie was had in much
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7338:68"/>
admiration and honour: and therefore was great <hi>Alexander</hi> despised by the Queene of <hi>Amazons,</hi> because in so puisant a prince she found not so pleasing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a comelinesses, as in her fantasie was thought that a man of such a famous and exceeding valor and victories should haue, the report of which moued her to visite him, as Queene <hi>Saba</hi> did <hi>Salomon,</hi> who was angellicall both in exterior and interior pulchritude. The complection therefore of such a magistrate should be temperate, either sanguine, or chollericke: for such persons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be sharpe witted; of a sound iudgement, and durable quicke memorie: they be iust, affable, faithfull, beneficent, magnificent, magnanimious, strong, valiant, &amp; well attempered with alacritie, agilitie, and health of bodie; if their natures be not with bad custome depraued or corrupted. The spirits of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons melancholike are dried vp, and earthie; rude, heauie, vaine, detesting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> honorable thoughts; malicious, supersticious, suspitious, enuious, ful of sorow, vexation, and contumely; how much more in age, so much lesse in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Neither are flegmatike persons eligible by the course of nature; being vicious, and vnapt for learning, by the rule of Philosophie. The stature of them therefore which are ordained, should be meane; the whole corporall membrature, iust, and proportionable; a visage liberall and ingenuous, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conciliating beneuolence and authoritie. For the reasonable soule (being gathered into a narrow roome) hath more force to worke; then as the sappe in a long slender tree which extending vnto the top and hight of many tall branches produceth lesse store of fruit by much; then it would haue done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in a brushie, short well knitted, and tenderly branched tree, whose radicall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour worketh in much lesse compasse. Howbeit I denie not but in the purest and best attempred complections, according with the iudgements of diuerse excellent naturallists and Philosophers, the power concupiscenciall will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly predominate and incite men to sinne. Yet if persons of those cleare consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and complections shall moderate their mentall perturbations and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall appetites; no men of other complections can haue power to come neare vnto them in vertues; if they set their hearts vpon righteousnesse, and call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of the most highest. For vnto this precious gift of temperance their nature is most neare; because their braines are lesse prouoked by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> distemperature of their inferior irascible and concupiscentiall parts. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection therfore most eligible is sanguine, aubourne haire, of a meane stature; vertuously instructed, healthfull and long liued. And these (vnlesse some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defect or violence against nature peruert the same) are for the most part endowed with much wisedome and wit: of which excellent kind we read in the bookes of the Kings, that king <hi>Dauid</hi> was; as, faire and ruddie with a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenance, &amp; body well shaped; &amp; of a meane stature. Howbeit, we find that he many times through those concupiscenciall motions was excited to sinne: yet had God so blessed him that he did not loose that habite of vertue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which was put vpon him with that blessing, when choise was first made of him to be the seruant of God, and vicegerent to rule his chosen people. In ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of counsellors, (according to <hi>Pliny)</hi> it was obserued that no man vnder thirtie yeeres of age should be permitted to consult in principall causes of the

Men therefore of middle age are to be chosen, whose humours are plausible and temperate; whose inward affections are delayed with some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and discretion; which can dispose, remember, and execute matters with a proportionable strength, courage, and grauitie; whose memorie will richly serue them for things past, whose vnderstanding to iudge of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent according to truth, and whose imagination participating of them both, can presage or prouide things to come; such men are importuned with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> thronging multitudes for counsell; and are to be chosen (as I set downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) by the prince himselfe vpon good experience had of their sufficiencies.

            <p>Nay true kings (as I said before) whose true firmament, is onely iustice) are knowen by two speciall things by which they retaine their kingdomes in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> peace and happinesse; that is by their zealous worshippe of God, and <note place="margin">In Thyeste.</note> their voluntarie subiection of themselues vnto the lawes by which they gouerne the nations on earth. Hence was it that <hi>Caelius</hi> did write of a graue, a iust, and a learned, prince which answered a certaine hypocriticall and dangerous flatterer (who did affirme that all the meanes and proceedings of princes concerning their estates generally were iust and honest) on this <note place="margin">Lib. antiq lect. 12. cap. 46.</note> fashion: <hi>Omnia per Iouem non sunt honesta, &amp; iusta, sed barbaris tantum.

amongst neighbours, the subuersion of Churches, hospitals, schooles, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> &amp; accademies, bestowing the lands with which they formerly were endowed vpon greedy flatterers, &amp; enemies of honestie: the taking away of fayres, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and other meanes wherby contrimen become strange one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the admittance of strangers into the publike corporations, ciuill societies, and other popular assemblies that they might snarle and entangle people in their words &amp; actions by which their priuiledges &amp; possessions may come to be seazed <hi>profisco.</hi> The dispersing through all places of the Commonwealth priuie whisperers &amp; informers, for the secret groping and mining into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels hearts; and to supplant the states of priuat gentlemen and persons of good qualitie: the sowing of factions, sedicious slaunders, and discentions amongst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> noblemen, rich men, and the commoners; by whose ruine his coffers may bee loaden: the driuing of poore folkes into mere miserie, feare, and pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimitie: the leuying and vndertaking of vniust war abroad, that he may make all sure at home.

            <p>Vpon the second meanes consisteth a counterfeit and hypocriticall care, or pretence to cherish the Commonwealth: th'exaction of tributes vnder the pretext of necessarie warres; and of oeconomicall occasions: to counterfeit a reuerende graee and plausible maiestie, both in person and countenance: to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> wound no man with open iniurie, but priuily to bite him to the bone: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine but one wife in open sight: admirably to dissemble sobrietie, vigilancie, the feare of God, and care of religion; and sometimes in specious apparance, to reward honest men vnder the pretext of vertue. And these haue beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as eminent qualities in malicious Tyrants, such as <hi>Caligula, Domitian,</hi> and <hi>Maximus:</hi> which being continually wounded, stabbed, and tormented with the bodkins, and furies of their mischieuous and impious actions and deuises; as <hi>Nero</hi> was, who (neither sleeping nor waking could rest alone, from horrible and fatall visions and apparitions; and being in companie stood in seare of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man about him) liued in a most miserable hell amongst men. The like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> was written of King <hi>Richard</hi> the third amongst vs, whose nefarious practises, and bloodie crymes were vnspeakable. Whereas if we should in contrary compare them with those vertuous and blessed Princes, whose gracious eyes inspired peace and plentie to the Commonwealth where they gouerned: it shall appeare, that like Angels vpon earth (with a comfortable remembrance and motion of their goodnesse and beneficence generally dispersed) they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in comparison of those other tryranous diuels. But I doubt least, I rest vpon this point more then fitteth, and therefore I will be so short, as I can in the rest.</p>
            <p>First therefore, a good and wise Prince may not maintaine any combate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> with fortune: as in contending to blow stronger then the windes, or to rore lowder then the Seaes; but to yeeld with warie vigilancie to her wrath, vntill prudent occasion bring her (in another bodie then before she was) well

            <p>Now to conculde in the foot of my second Booke, with the Prince, who is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> both top &amp; root of this Counsell, being therefore called, <hi>Consilium priuatum</hi> (as <hi>Vincentius Lupanus</hi> writeth) <hi>Quasi secretius, interius, selectius, &amp; sanctius dixeris:</hi> As if you should say the most secret, inward, choise, and holy counsell.

            <p>Ciuill right is that by which euery Commonwealth is gouerned.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> comprehending diuers necessarie statutes peculiar to that nation.

And this is the very reason which includeth euery good Prince also within the limits of his owne Lawes; being <hi>Per necessitatis legem ligatus:</hi> Bound by the Lawes of necessitie, to make good his owne act; least through his refusall hee giue the first scope and light vnto the vulgar, to contemne Iustice and magistracie.

Those also which in feare to loose their present liues or liberties, &amp; those which in loue of this world, and those which in vsing this world as though they should alwayes vse it, withdraw themselues from open offences, are for the most part Epicures, Atheists, Hypocrites, or wicked persons, not performing any good thing out of their owne francke wils and honest consciences, but by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> constraint and feare.

Howbeit, these reports and finall sentences in such Cases, cannot binde the Iudges of after-times in the same Cases, to giue sentence accordingly: which argueth that amongst vs those reports or finall sentences of Iudges haue not such legall force; as those <hi>Sense<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Howbeit, they be vehement motiues, inductions, and guides vnto Iudges in such Cases, to leane vnto the like opinions.

It should therefore seeme to stand with great right and reason, that such sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of reuerend and learned Iudges in our Common-lawes formerly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and past, should not necessarily binde all other Iudges after them: which grounded vpon good and probable reason with equitie) may percase in some pointes vary from those former. Notwithstanding, if all the learned Iudges of this Realme assemble in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> or els-where, to conclude vpon any weightie case (ambiguously depending in the Courts, either for the Prince, or for any subiect of what condition soeuer) should with a francke consent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and vnanimitie giue opinion according to their priuate consciences, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere interpretation of the Law: without question it must of force moue the Iudges in succession (which handle the like cases) to dispatch them, by that precedent, and with expedition accordingly.</p>

This is the difference betwixt the right of nature, and of ciuill right; that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the naturall is firme and immutable, the ciuill is changed and and abrogated, by consent of persons at any time: As when in a present Parliament such a Statute happeneth to be repealed, annullated, or antiquated, which had been enacted, instituted, and established in other Parliaments before.

            <p>The course of our English lawes holdeth in erection of Courtes, which <hi>Ceriolano</hi> termeth Counsels; and these are either Ecclesiasticall or ciuill.

            <p>These our Parliament lawes like liuely blood dispersed through the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and prouinces of our whole Common-wealth are executed in time, and vpon needfull occasion as is fit; ministring matter for all other inferior courts, which haue iurisdiction ouer all causes needing present succour.

If therefore any thing passe in those hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament by generall consent, concerning the publicke weale or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good or euill, it behooueth first that they soundly and maturely deliberate and consult vpon any thing important; sifting out the circumstances which may tend to the most benefit or praeiudice, and (conscionably pondering each point in the ballance of reason) may condiscend to that which will least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice the maine: for when the billes of those houses are once exhibited, past, and inacted, they cannot be repealed without another Parliament, by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> consent of the Prince and of all persons. In this high court, all Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (issuing out of the Kings bench, the Chauncerie, Common plees, the Exchequer, the court of Wardes, and that which proceedeth out of the court of Parliament it selfe) may bee reuersed by writ of Error.

            <p>Ciuill courts hold plees either in cases of right dealing, or in ciuill causes betwixt the prince and his tenants. But of the Exchequer, where those cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses betwixt the Prince and his tenants are decyded, I did speake somewhat in my first Booke.</p>

            <p>It is sooth, and well answereth to the lore of wisedome, that all policies States, or Common-weales are most corrupt, wherein there be many lawes established: forsomuch as it is presupposed that where multitudes of crimes and vices predominate of strange and diuers qualities, diuers vnusuall and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> strange lawes are necessarily made to restraine them; or if they be preordained to correct or prohibit vices which are not &amp; yet may happen, then it is as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in regard of that expressed in this poeticall sentence, <hi>Gens humana ruit in vetitum nefas:</hi> For <hi>Adams</hi> children naturally lust after the forbidden fruit. Not many Bookes which confound mens memorie with heapes of words and matter, but few substantiall and necessarie: referring all pettie things, not being nefarious, to the censure of venerable magistrates (which will not suffer a sparke to make a flame) and not to the written Letter of <hi>Poenall Lawes;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how the meane ministers and executioners of them which search out, inquire, and informe of such offences, doe commonly more preiudice then benefit and honestie to the Commonwealth: For wee know that by Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> finger all the lawes both diuine and humane were within a paire of marble Tables comprised in a compendious Decalogue.</p>
            <p>The reports and causes of our common-lawes and iudgements haue appeared in two points that the former Kings of this Realme, as king <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henrie</hi> the fift, <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixt, <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Richard</hi> the third, <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth with prudent inspection found that necessitie, which required a luculent interpretation of the difficult points in our Common-lawes: wherevpon they by the faithfull conference of foure most reuerend and learned Iudges in the Lawes, following the sage example of that most wise and victorious Emperor <hi>Iustinianus</hi> before mentioned, did each of them in their seuerall raignes cause the genuine and very sence by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> specious enucleation of all intricate or equiuocall points and cases to be cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

good; hauing digested them into nine Volumes of the Lawes, wherin the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whole essence of all by those reuerend Law-fathers was most methodically couched. For as the difference of all creatures by nature proceedeth from vnitie, resembling many flowers sprouting from one roote: euen so doe sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie needfull and most beneuolent Lawes receiue life and nature from the precious wisedom of God; the blessed and all-healing fountaine of whose knowledge he with ineffable grace and diuine beneficence openeth to them all that are studious of righteousnesse, and in tender loue with respect vnto man, being the choise operation of his handes doth retaine him by the due feare and loue of iustice and saluation, in eternall tranquilitie. The generall benefit calmely and plentifully redounding from those Bookes, iudgements, reports and Law-cases by the enucleation of those learned law-men (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> expressed) includeth the second point.</p>
            <p>Forsomuch as concerneth humane Lawes which are ordained by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and published by the prince (which by them gouerneth the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to relieue and rectifie the same) they must be iust and possible, needfull and profitable, plaine, prescribed not to priuate but to publike vse and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, consenting with time and place, according to the nature and custome of the Countrey which should be moderated by them: such as are our statute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawes of <hi>England.</hi> Vpon these thus ordained and prouided against faultes, a knowledge shewing the difference of crimes and vices dependeth: As whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nature of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> consist in impietie by violation of the first table of Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> lawes through foolish prophanation, or derrogation of or from his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power and maiestie; or if it be flagitious and repugnant to the second, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting impietie towards parents and magistrates, the defamation or contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies of neighbours, the concupiscence and losse of liuelihoods and liues, wherevpon parricides and horrible slaughters are bred. Towards which le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall office or ministerie, three speciall things generally would be required in a Iudge: the first of which is in his head to retaine a firme and venerable graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, confirmed in his countenance with some serious kinde of awfull maiestie, through his continuall meditation vpon the iust iudgements of God with the charge vpon him imposed; which by the diuine gift of heauenly iustice must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be fostered in his heart, that all proceedings drawne from thence may be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with the grauitie of his cogitations, which in excellent discretion will point out to him the time, person, and place, when, to whom, and where hee should shew iustice naked, or inuested with mercie. So that by the iustice of of his heart, which ministreth wisedome and grauitie to his head; and by the seuere and precise prudence of his head, which inblazoned in a stedfast coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance a stout maiestie withall; and by the comely grace of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which admirably shadoweth all in a decent austeritie, there may be due reuerence and feare drawne to the person of a Iudge on euery side about him; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> infusing horror to the malicious and wicked, with loue and reuerence to good and iust persons, hauing his tong so sanctified and seared with zealous praier, and with a liuely cole taken from the blessed Altar by the sacred Cherubine, that it may become th'oracle of Gods iustice, and the iust herauld of a sincere
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7338:80"/>
heart. For if grauitie should not appeare in all his iudgements, then shall he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> be suspected of a partiall &amp; foolish lentitude: which opinion (when it is once vulgarly conceiued) will preiudice him either in his reputation, or in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Lawes. This reputation or authoritie likewise is by the first three properties delineated to life; the restraint whereof will disaduantage him in his honour, which by such demeanor will be blemished with some misprizion or suspect of corruption. There is likewise in euery wise Iudge expedient a mature experience in sutes and variances, by defect whereof his ignorance deepely woundeth, or rather maimeth him. Lastly, the mindes constancie corroborateth him in the perfection of all, declaring that in the whole course of all his iudgements, iustice alone without priuate affection <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> preuaileth. Neither is it meete but most vnfit, that any man should sit on throne of iudgement or giue sentence when his owne cause is heard or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed: least affection vsurpe vpon, and defile the tongue of magistracie, least the reuerend custome of iudgement be violated, least that maiestie whereof I spoke (which is meete for the sage tribunall and court of equitie) be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, least a mischieuous example corrupting the people be drawne on with it, and finally least a contempt of the Lawes and equitie do succced it. Now somewhat concerning that abilitie which strengthneth Iudges, and iuridicall magistrates in the administration of publike causes.</p>
            <p>It is therefore principally to be considered, that they (which sit vpon this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> honourable throne of iudgement, and take place, to giue place vnto the due distribution of right, and are firmely planted for the sure supplantation of those contageous vices, which being but a little licenced would disperse and spread through all parts of the Common-weales most beautifull bodie, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it with a foule and virulent leprosie) stand deeply bound in a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognisance of soule and bodie to be studious and industrious in the science and iudiciall practise of that wholesome physicke, which must be frequently ministred to the diseased members of that State: In which (their iudgements being credited) may be by the Prince allowed and iustified also: for if they doe not yeeld euen law and execution of right to all subiects rich and poore, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> without hauing regard to any person, and without letting to doe right for any letters or commandement which may come to them from the prince or king, or from any other by any other cause, then are they by our Lawes thus censured worthily: Their bodies, lands and goods to rest at the kings pleasure, <note place="margin">Cap. 1.

Lastly, but specially let him haue a speciall care <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to be skilfull in those lawes which he deliuereth and administreth: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his honor is onerous and insupportable.

Euery king, iudge, and ruler of the people therefore, ought to ponder with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> himselfe how great a part of the Commonweales hope dependeth vpon him, which he should with his vertues and innocencie protect, whereas all other meanes are forcelesse. Yea verely the iudge representeth in himselfe the person of that Commonwealth, where he ministreth: wherefore he should sustaine the state and honor thereof by conseruation and administration of iustice bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in carefull remembrance, the trust of those things which are reposed in him. A iudge is as it were an eye fixed in the kings scepter, a priest of diuine iustice and equitie, a moderator of the lawes, the life of righteousnesse, whose voyce is the pronouncer and preseruer of life and death, a publike interpreter of the lawes; vnto whom as to a common sanctuarie, all persons oppressed with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> dammages &amp; iniuries repaire and refuge themselues to be relieued in equity. And euen as iust iudgement is fitly defined to be the ballance of equitie, the voyce of lawes, and consummation of all strife and variance, so is the iudge properly called th'interpreter of those lawes, the steward of equitie, and ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>They therefore that are fit and worthy to sit vpon the throne of equitie, ought sincerely to be good men, seuere, incorrupt, obdurate against flatterers, impatient of smooth tales, and secret detraction, vnmercifull to them that are remedilesse, inexorable in waightie causes of iudgement, and such as will not transgresse the precincts of iustice in any case: for according to the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> they must distribute to the king and begger equall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure without inclination or passion towards any mans estate or person: as it <note place="margin">Lib. 10. cap. 4.</note> was most diuinely shadowed in that misticall order of the <hi>Areopagites</hi> being a counsell in <hi>Athens,</hi> consisting of sixtie citizens which successiuely through all offices and degrees of honor at length attained place vpon the seate of iustice to deale in affaires of state, and in tempestuous times to prouide that the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth should endure no preiudice.

            <p>Vpon this misrule, or misguidance of the Common-wealth by corrupt iudgement or iniquitie, whereupon the deuouring tempests of iniuries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies, and deceits arise, Kingdomes (by Gods iust iudgement and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) are translated from one nation to another, roiall families extinguished, and the prince with his people oftentimes subuerted, as is verily frequent vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them that with diligence read histories in example.</p>
            <p>I will now speake somewhat touching their administration of Iustice in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill matters, which is either declared in causes litigious brought before them, for the tryall of lands and goods; or in penall cases for transgressing Lawes in some one of the three parts of iustice which they violate: wherein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the Iudge with the causes of equitie, should make the true ballance of right. Penall cases for priuate transgressions be semblably referred in forme (though not altogether in substance) to the Iudges discreet conscience. This onely should remaine euer greene in his memorie, that all iudgements in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill causes be well attempered with a mercifull benignitie, if the nature and qualities of the faults and delinquent permit. First therfore it is to be weighed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that all offences either respect the contumelies of persons comprehending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries; th'expence or losse of goods including damages; and offences or hurts done to people, including maymes and slaughters. Iniuries therefore are harmes proceeding from a voluntarie and malicious heart, thirsting or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after hurt of others. Damages include losse procured by the delinquent, either through vniust molestation by sutes vniustly commenced of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the innocent is impouerished; or by violent rapine, theft, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion. Offences and hurtes are of diuers natures, either by riots, affrayes, conspiracies, or murthers of themselues, as principals, or by subornate persons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and assistants, as accessaries, acted, &amp; executed. And herein is to be considered, that all maner of wrongs and iniustice, proceed either from election and will, perturbation and appetite, ignorance and vnderstanding, euen as in contrary those actions which are iust, are operations, or proceedings deriued from

            <p>It is not permitted that a Iudge should command and prohibite what he list himselfe without legall warrant, albeit it might rest in his arbitrament: yet whereas all articles cannot be seuerally comprised in the Lawes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as many circumstances breed doubts, in such cases men are referred to the conscience and religion of the Iudge, neerly to determine by course of iustice according to sinceritie: further scope then this is not permitted vnto any, being by that benefit freed from perill of punishment though he giue sentence against the Law: for the case not being throughly discussed yeeldeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him some colour for excuse; excepting alwayes in litigious cases that it rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in his power to giue away the goods proper of any man, beyond the limits of reason and equitie. That kinde of iustecying which is said to bee common amongst the Turkes, is in my iudgement very tollerable and soone ended: for the Iudge closing his eyes giueth eare, pondereth, pronounceth, and dispatcheth the most part of causes very commendably, freeing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasing the sutors from expence of time and monie: both which incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences happen vpon the processe of our Lawes in Christendome. For it had beene oftentimes better that he which hath iustice to guard his good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cause, should in commencement thereof haue let his sute fall; then after a long and litigious dependance buy the iudgement of it with more chardge then the maine was worth, being onely referred to the credite of iust victorie for his meede. Moreouer by such dilatory meanes it often happeneth that white is died into blacke, either through deceit, corruption, or ignorance of the Iudge, and elsewhere by the rigor and false interpretation of the Lawes. Howbeit to noble minded men, which are able to forbeare (if the sute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from misprision or some misconstruction, and not from any litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humour of the aduersarie) I deeme it a principall tipe of their honours, and much auaylable (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) <hi>Paulum nonnunquam de suo iure dece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.</hi>

            <p>In administration of ciuill causes also, there is one most commendable part requisite in a iudge, that he withdraw his hands from the rewards of priuate or poore persons, which would gladly giue somewhat for fauour in their iust

and honest causes. For iudges of that nature are blinded with auarice whose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> fashion is to make a gaine of all causes both honest and dishonest: hence was it that iudges <hi>lege Clodia</hi> were prohibited to take any rewards of persons in suite. In speciall all such rewards and gratifications as are giuen either to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a good or a bad cause (sauing the fees lawfully limited to the iudges and pleaders, in regard of their salaries and paines) are dissalowable; and if any be tollerable then onely such as are taken by them of great princes which reward their paines in aduancement of iustice onely: For such as sell iustice and truth are abhominable, and so bethose also which take gifts of any man to further a faultie: for in that false participation if he further him, then doth he manifest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> violence to iustice; and if not, then doth he deceiue the briber of his money, both which are abiect and contemptible: these may well be called mercenarie iudges and corrupt hirelings.</p>
            <p>Now somewhat so short as I can, concerning the knowledge and studies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in iudges &amp; iudiciall magistrates. The due reuerence and feare of Gods omnipotent vertue which illuminateth his vnderstanding, perfecteth his wisdome, amplifieth his maiestie, refresheth his spirits, &amp; corroborateth all his iudgements, must aboue all things before and after iudgement, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with a zealous and effectuall prayer from a soule blessedly breathing after spirituall consolation, be principally retained. And therefore it is written by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> 
               <hi>Moyses,</hi> that <hi>iudges should be men of courage, fearing God, dealing truely, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auarice.</hi> And for this cause the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth them Gods say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Exod. 18.</note> that all <hi>the children of the most high doe right and iustice vnto the fatherlesse, poore, and needie.</hi> His ordinarie studies therfore for pleasure and ornament are <note place="margin">Psal. 82.</note> best approued in the sweete concord of morall Philosophie which will enable and confirme him in his profession and conuersation: this teacheth him how iustice is a vertue yeelding <hi>euery man what is his owne, and willing all men to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their dueties.

            <p>Iustice according to some learned moralists is knowen by these attributes or qualities: first she will not challenge any thing which is not her owne; then she doth neglect her owne priuate lucre in respect if she may thereby fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the common equitie. There be sixe kindes of Iustice according to some very learned philosophers, and they should seeme to be very certaine: one iustice is legall, being a kind of voluntarie affection to doe and desire iust things; and by this legall iustice are men wholie bentand inclined for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their contrey. The second a morall iustice which I prementioned out of th'imperiall institutions being a constant and perpetuall will, yeelding each <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> man his owne. The third a kind of exchanging or commutuall iustice keeping a precise and religious equalitie of things amongst men. The fourth is a iustice distributiue by which euery man is out of the common charge of his contrey rewarded and relieued according to demerite. The fifth is a coniunctiue iustice, appliable to persons and causes tyed together in any termes of iustice. And the sixt is disiunctiue, alluding to causes and persons which are not by any meanes of equitie compared or knit together.</p>
            <p>This vertue principally respecteth the benefit of others more then her owne, which as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith is not so specious in her fellow vertues. According to <hi>Valerius</hi> and some other Philosophers, there are two parts of iustice: the first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> obedience, which is generall, by which th'inferior offices of the soule are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected vnto reason being imployed in keeping a proportion amongst popular societies, respecting the commonweale, &amp; instructing persons in the reuerence and loue of iustice and equitie: the second part is priuate, restoring right to all men; which is also twofold. One part thereof holdeth a simetrie in contracts and negotiations amongst men; th'other being distributiue imparteth rewards proportionable to their demerites. And this distributiue part of iustice is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led equalitie being the companion of peace and concord: <hi>Quae in tribuendis honoribus &amp; reru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>inter ciues communium aequa diuisione seruatur:</hi> Which equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is kept in distribution of honors, and in equall diuision of things amongst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> citizens &amp; countrimen, &amp;c. <hi>Cicero</hi> defineth the law which is deriued from iustice to be reason graffed in humane nature: vnto this all lawes and institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, customes, edicts, estatutes (which further the conseruation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths) haue reference: And in obseruation and violation of them iustice &amp; iniustice are opened. There is no diuersitie betwixt law and vertue, sauing that vertue by words and promises benignely perswadeth whereas law commaundeth, compelleth, and inhibiteth. The distributiue part of priuate iustice cheefely concerneth magistrates, consisting in rewards, punishments, iust gouernement, teaching all sorts of people to know their offices, places, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dignities and degrees in the Commonweales, to take good notice of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues without ostentation or insolence. This vertue Philosophers conferre with geometrie because it is vniforme. Iniustice is either generall or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: that (which I terme generall and illegitimate) is a kind of habite of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7338:84"/>
minde depraued and corrupted, by means whereof men in dignitie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> digresse from the sincere and sacred gubernation of the Lawes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting those that are vnder their authoritie to be defiled and infected with contagious vices. The particular iniustice is that iniquitie by which any man taketh or giueth, from or vnto persons more or lesse then standeth with reason or desert.</p>
            <p>Out of the whole substance of iustice (according to <hi>Cicero)</hi> these bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or properties are obserued and found; <hi>Religion, pietie, duetie, veritie, vindication, graticude, mercie, liberalitie, magnificence, friendship:</hi> all which fasten themselues to the lists of reason. And herein are three sortes of Lawes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised: one naturall, not deriued from opinion, but from a certaine force in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> vs innated; another customarie, which hath by consent of nations and people without written law, tradicionally continued in force a long time; the third legitimate, which are recorded in bookes written and knowne, according to my diuision out of the ciuill institutions mentioned before. This law is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, as either in the most needfull respect in vs, which should intimate the most zealous inuocation &amp; adoration of Gods blessed maiestie, being both in holy writ, &amp; all sanctions of men vehemently imposed vpon vs: the other relyeth vpon humane societie which is called equitie; from whence that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall definition of Law was drawne, which calleth it the art of equitie and goodnesse. All morall parts of iustice, whereof this booke of Counsell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> intreateth, are therefore comprised in true religion, which is the iust and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained seruice of God. In pietie, which exhibiteth a iust respect of persons our superiors in degrees &amp; offices. In veritie, being the iustice of our tongues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounding with a true heart, which is the diuine treasure of faith. In vindicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is a iust and lawfull defence, or offence against open violence. In gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which is a iust remuneration of benefits answerable to mens faculties. In mercie, which is a principall part of diuine and naturall iustice towardes our brethren depressed with afflictions. In liberalitie, which is a iust dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of necessarie reliefe to certaine persons according to reason. In mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, which is a iust largesse imployed to vertuous and godly purposes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> And in friendship, which is of it selfe a naturall iustice due to vertue. The opposites of which are accordingly called the branches of Iniustice: Since therefore all vertues seeme most specious when they be conferred with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites, I will define their contraries.</p>
            <p>Therefore against true religion, I plant hypocritiall superstition, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise curiositie, being the vaine &amp; vnprofitable seruice of God, fashioned after the newfangled humors and schismaticall fancies of nice greene heads: From whence floweth that detestable plague, impious prophanation of Gods sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> power, contempt or disestimation of others and religion, the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of damned persons, Epicures and Athiests, which deeply roote impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, sacriledge, infidelitie, and periurie.</p>
            <p>Against pietie stubbornly marcheth fourth impietie, being a want of due beneuolence, obedience, or charitie towardes magistrates: as when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne or calumniate rulers, which is prohibited by <hi>Moses.</hi> A singular of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample <note place="margin">22.

            <p>Dutie being by disobedience confronted, herein looseth his prerogatiue, that stubbornnesse (which taketh root in pride) contumeliously reiecteth it.

This haue I found by good experience both in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and by some priuate respects of my selfe and others most neere vnto me; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not doubting but that it is a vulgar proofe, wherein this worlds aged maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie through diuelish continuance hath increased it from a wily serpent to a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, malicious, and murthering old dragon; like that which is spoken of, in the Reuelation of the blessed Euangelist <hi>Iohn,</hi> being now set free from fetters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the last times; and amongst wise men so detestable and odious, that by their often repetion it became a prouerbe generally deliuered, <hi>if you call me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull, call me what you will:</hi> for nothing can be more disgracefull or infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.

This in like opposition with the former is the very seede of all disunion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice. From hence distractions, seditions, factions, oppressions, and diuers sutes arise which neuer haue end nor will, but by conspiracies; vpon which the prince is many times forced to staine his hands with blood, or to loose his soueraignetie. Many men neglect this, not looking into the danger which dayly stealeth out of it: and yet it is easily found, if they consider <hi>how the seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of each yeere present occasioneth the next yeeres haruest;</hi> ministring store of matter to gorge vp the couetous bags of some ambicious Lawmen, Aduocats <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and Atturneyes. Now somewhat concerning that abilitie which strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth iudges and iuridicall magistrates in th'administration of publike affaires.</p>
            <p>To the perfection of knowledge herein it is right behoouefull that they which iudge, be soundly read and practised in all the lawes Ciuill, Cannon, and prouinciall consenting with the lawes of those nations where men liue, and also the lawes of all neighbouring Commonweales politickely gouerned, whether they be Christian or pagane, conferring them with the ground of all good laws deliuered first by God to the sacred prince <hi>Moyses</hi> his seruant in the decalogue: as also that he studiously peruse all the bookes of <hi>Moyses,</hi> wherein the politicke statutes and ordinances deriued from the fountaine of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serchable wisedome are touched; as in the bookes of <hi>Exodus, Detronomie,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
               <hi>Numbers:</hi> likewise in the <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Kings.</hi> Nay let him peruse the whole vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of the new Testament; wherein he shall find the true formes and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all good lawes and iudgements. Likewise let him conuerse with the lawes of the ancient Egyptians which (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> recordeth them) are like in <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 3. lib. hist.</note> nature to these our Brittaine lawes; from whence together with the secret mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7338:88"/>
of their gods, those ordinances were by <hi>Orpheus</hi> translated into Greece: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> also the Troiane and Greeke laws, from whenceour Nation (as I before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) did receiue their first orders of gouernment: the lawes of Saxons and Danes when they did inhabite vs; conferring them seuerally together, &amp; pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering which neerest cohere in precepts &amp; vniformitie with the sacred Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
            <p>It is also most commendable, and would adde infinite riches to his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ement, if he can by diligent reading attaine the Lawes of all principall States and Kingdomes in this age established as in Spaine, France, Portugall, the free States of Italie, the Empire of Germany, the Cantons of Swizzer-land, the Kingdomes of Poleland, Hungaria, Prussia, Moscouia, with such like: most of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which although they be gouerned by the lawes imperiall, haue not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Edicts, &amp; customarie prescriptions retaining legall force, which are most fit and worthy to be knowne. Also the Lawes of the Turkes, of the Persians, and of any strange heathens in the world, which are partakers and be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by rule of reason.</p>
            <p>This Science with the riches of that knowledge, which may be gotten by the same together with the iudicious conference of one with another, I cannot sufficiently declare nor commend: neither, if it were possible for a man, all other means being wanting thervnto to liue vntill he had visited those nations, and had soiourned in each particular countrey, till he were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with their seuerall Lawes and orders, could his paines answere the least part of benefit which that knowledge will dispense.</p>
            <p>In publicke iudgements (which according to th'imperiall Institutions are so called, because the execution of them is referred to any of the people) it much importeth him to be very skilfull, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferring them to the benefit of his priuate iudgement with the publicke iudgements, as in cases criminall of his owne nation. Of these some being capitall and the rest not capitall: those which are, doe punish with death or perpetuall exile; as it was called by the Romans, <hi>Interdiction from fire and water,</hi> by which was intended an exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all other benefit, or comfort of his natiue Countrey.

Other iudgements vpon defamation proceed with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary mulct, which are also publicke and not capitall.</p>
            <p>Howbeit publicke iudgements principally proceed in matters of maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, touching traytors against the King or Common-wealth, punished with <note place="margin">Ad legem Iul. maiestatis.</note> losse of life, and extirpation of their remembrance after their death in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of blood, and destruction of their houses which should be demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

            <p>All criminall causes according to the forme of our Lawes, are either treasons or felonies; and those courts in <hi>England</hi> which are ordained for tryall of them that stand appealed for such crimes, are the <hi>Kingsbench,</hi> or <hi>Gaole deliueryes.</hi> Which iudgements are through all Counties of this Realme, once each

In iudgements criminall, generally requiring the deepest and soundest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> discretion of Iudges, there is one question which I haue heard controuerted: Whether in them it be better and more expedient to shew mercie then rigor? but it is by the stronger part of opinions confirmed, that in the gouernment of a multitude (where the crimes are treasonable or infectious) seuere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment much more auaileth then lenitie. Which <hi>Tacitus</hi> no lesse sagely (though liuing in a tyrannous Empire) doth confirme. Yet forsomuch as it is no part of my profession (but in somewhat impertinent) to declare the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all these causes criminall according to their natures; I will pretermit and handle only such things, as are required of a Iudge in his general decision or execution of them.</p>
            <p>Punishments therefore are either frequent, or rare: mitigate punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of multitudes together with frequent practize of them. And he which hastily proceedeth to sentence of condemnation, will be generally said and condemned to haue done it willingly. If occasion so require, that for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall good and quiet, a multitude must vndergoe punishment; make speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous demonstration, that it is onely done to preuent further offence, and not in regard of the fault: shew neither wrath nor gladnesse in punishing; inflict not any strange or extreame punishments: for they be dangerous, &amp; the Iudges which punish after new fashions are vndoubtedly cruell. Be not partiall in punishing, as in dealing more seuerely with some, then with others whose faults are of equall qualitie. Neither be present spectators at the execution of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> malefactors: which violent &amp; irous appearance, hath drowned many princes in the blood of their Tyrannie. And whereas it doth happen frequently; that many persons and some of the best estate and qualitie, cannot be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with death, but with the great danger and hatred of the Iudge; which he should wholy neglect, honourably respecting the person of veritie, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in himselfe; it is required, that in heinous causes all the heads be cut off together, and that not leasurely one by one: For often reiteration of blood giueth suspition of mercilesse truculencie, stirring malice in many men and pleasing few: onely the due respect of seueritie bent against them (whose pardons are full of perill) presently washing out the note or malice of that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with remission and indulgence of other offendors, whose crimes being of a more humble nature, include not much danger in them.

               <hi>Zaluchus</hi> (hauing made a Law to the <hi>Locrensians,</hi> that any persons of that common-wealth, if they were taken in adulterie, should loose both their eyes) was forced to giue sentence against his owne sonne, which stood in that case appealed before him: &amp; notwithstanding that earnest intercession made by the people for his pardon; yet in satisfaction of the Law, he caused one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> his owne and another of his sonnes eyes to be done out. In what ought a Iudge to declare more constant veritie, then in iuridicall sentences? in what more zeale then in execution of the Lawes? in what place more maiestie then on the venerable throne of iustice?</p>
            <p>I will confirme this with a familiar example of common record in our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Chronicles. <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Monm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7338:90"/>
did afterwards succeede his father) rushed vnto the Kings Bench (the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> chiefe Iustice of England sitting in iudgement vpon life and death of one of that princes seruants, then in case of felonie brought vnto the bar before him) and with his sword drawen made offer to rescue the prisoner without further triall: the people astonished at such vnusuall behauiour, were afraid. The iudge himselfe, or rather Gods spirit directing, wisely weighing his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and looking into trueth and authoritie, banisheth all suddaine feare, and stoutly with a reuerend maiestie rebuketh the prince in this sort. Come hether furious yongman, wound this old carcase with thy sword wherewith thou menacest me; strike, strike I say, rather will I die then endure such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. This place which thou doest violate is thy fathers tribunall, the iudge who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou threatnest representeth thy father, the law which thou contemnest, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> adiudgeth thee guiltie for it; and without any respect that thou art sonne to the king, on behalfe of thy father, and being assisted and supported with the Commonweales authoritie, I doe commit thee to prison. At which reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and constant iudgement of the magistrate, the prince abashed presently let fall his sword, and willingly submitted himselfe to prison. The king vpon this tragaecomedie reported, burst with teares into these speeches: happie am I in so iust &amp; sincere a iudge, &amp; in so good and obedient a sonne. Which gallant prince succeeding his sather in the gouernement so much esteemed of that iudge, as (when he departed England with his forces towards France for that conquest which he there purchased) he committed the tuition and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of his whole realme, during that his absence to him: the historie is true though common, and yet not so vulgar as notable.</p>
            <p>Sedition and malice being two pestilent and contagious diseases in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth should be seuerely punished in the beginnings without remission, yet with such discretion handled, as it might seeme rather to proceede from a mind very loath, and grieuing to punish, but that constraint and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause enforceth it. Howbeit, somewhat must alwayes be done for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples sake considering the sentence, <hi>Panarum fructus omnium maximus perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net ad exemplum.

            <p>There is great daunger in ministring a more vehement medecine, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nature or strength of the disease or diseased doth require. Applie not any corrosiues but vpon extremities and causes otherwise remedilesse. He which hatcheth vengeance in his heart, may not punish hastely but expect a fit occasion for his owne satisfaction, which will vndoubtedly fall without any combustion, note, or imputation of reuenge. Those iudges therefore I deeme wel worthie commendation, which seldome vsing seueritie can attaine and keepe the name of terrible magistrates: for by much exercise of bloodie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> iustice as I said before, more harme then good ensueth to the prince; for not onely the persons fauourers of the parties punished, but the peoples hearts in generall will storme at it: and admit you can remoue some of the first which stirre in it; yet in a case of crueltie the peoples indignation may fitly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to wild-fire, which being once kindled will encrease and burne more

vehemently. If therefore a Iudge extend seueritie, let it be manifested espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> when matters of blood and violation of humane charitie requireth it: when violence vpon impious passion or perturbation of the minde, to satisfie priuate malice is exercised vpon persons; which no man being moderated by the Law of nature will commit: as <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth; <hi>hominem naturae obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Offic. 3.</note> 
               <hi>homini nocere non posse:</hi> That not any man which is obedient to nature will hurt another man. Neither can any thing expresse the prudence of a magistrate more to life, then the iust conseruation and maintenance of a mans life; nothing decipher his crueltie more, then slaughter and effusion of blood. How odious is the very name of homicide, by whose violence man which is the goodliest artifice of nature is dissolued? Nothing therefore should in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ciuill societie be more seuerely sifted, nothing feele more extreame punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then murtherers. A iust Iudge therefore sitting in iudgement vpon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micides, should in his right hand hold a Iasper stone, to stanch the blood of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents; &amp; in the left a sword to strike bloody murtherers and slaughterers: so that the sword be not more forcible then the stone, least his wrath conquer clemencie when he reuengeth blood.</p>
            <p>Next vnto murther is that vlcerous and vnsatiable wolfe vsurie, which like a cancor consumeth the flesh and bones of Prince and people. It is the extreamest stincking plague of any common-wealth. And hence was it, that <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> said, <hi>How murther and vsurie were correlatiue.</hi> Which leprous botch (for I cannot giue it a terme bad enough) the Romans punished more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> seuerely then felonie. And <hi>Salust</hi> likewise aduising <hi>Caesar</hi> in one of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions saith; <hi>Tollendus foenerator vt suas quisque res curemus:</hi> Vsurers must be banished, that euery man may the better follow his priuate businesse. Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating those lets and obstacles which happen to the common-wealth; where diuers principall persons are consumed and eaten vp with vsurie. Saying moreouer, that all things would haue good successe in the common-wealth, <hi>Sipecuniae (quae maxima omnium pernicies est) vsum atque dedecus dempserit:</hi> If he would so practise, that the vse and disgrace of selling and lending of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <note place="margin">Ad. Cas. de rep. ordinanda.</note> (which he termeth the greatest of all harmes) may be taken away.</p>
            <p>There yet remaineth one principall respect and consideration for Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Iudges, which specially concerneth the common-wealth: to take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> such carefull heed and circumspection as may be, that all men and persons, yong and old, of all trades and professions in all townes and cities, doe follow with diligence and commendable industrie their seuerall functions and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which is the readiest meane both to magnifie and amplifie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. And therefore <hi>Francis Patricius,</hi> in his booke <hi>De institutione</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. tit. 8.</note> 
               <hi>reipub.</hi> writeth that they should <hi>Otij magis quam negotij rationem exigere:</hi> To take more precise account of idle fellowes then of labourers: which those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> that liued in <hi>India,</hi> did with all industrie; for they were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that nothing could be more odious in any societies, states, or Cities, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> then sloath and idlenesse. For the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> did alwayes before meat exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their youth, how they had imployed that part of the day, and onely permitted such to receiue meate whose exercises they did approue, thrusting

            <p>Hence was that law amongst the Egyptians which <hi>Diodorus</hi> mentioneth <note place="margin">Lib. 1. bib. l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Vnto the performance of these warres thus iustly to be commenced and raised the choise of sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors is first required, as well Captaines as ordinarie seruitors, including sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors for fight, and labourers for worke. Of these in their particular offices and degrees successiuely.</p>
            <p>The first and highest place of power and reputation in the field, the Prince himselfe vpon some principall causes in his owne person houldeth; vnder whom all other Generals and Captaines are waged, and beare office. But forsomuch as at this day few princes are seene militant in forraine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> vnlesse they stand appealed to such battels forcibly, through some forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iniustice of others, either vpon detinew of due tributes or territories (the custome and possession whereof hath beene of most ancient memorie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his antecessors by discreet succession, to the very point of his own raigne) and also because fewe Princes are personally seene in battels of our dayes vpon their ownesoyle, vnlesse against assailants or tirannous vsurpers; such as were expected (of which I spake before) by our soueraigne <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and prouided against the inuasion of King <hi>Philip Anno</hi> 1588. and for some other particular reasons, I will passe ouer the particulars of his highest place in martiall Campe, referring my selfe to his commission; by vertue whereof, vpon ordinary tearmes of warre, the Prince or Emperor deputeth his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> generall to supply the place and office of maiestie; hauing sometimes certaine priuate and princely directions not expressed, by which in dearest trust to him by his soueraigne committed he must shape his course. In all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apparance, he must cape according to the strict tenor of his instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in commission vnder the Prince his great seale deliuered. The least silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in sence being expressed therein, he may not without high danger to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe transgresse; vnlesse the soueraignes aduice and opinion be first had and knowne, or after vpon more firme reconsideration deliuered.</p>
            <p>The princes deepe Iudgement and discretion in electing of his Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall, ought to be principally grounded vpon good aduice, and sure notice taken of his sufficiencie for such a place. First he should be a man of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> able, strong, and actiue bodie, well knit, of a durable complexion, neither too much brent, nor drowned (as I sayd in the secret councellor) hard and at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with tendernesse, delighting in paines and practise of Armes: and in him fiue principall things are required.</p>
            <p>The first is fidelitie, rebounding from his dignities and noble education; opposite to which standeth infidelitie issuing from auarice and malice: for such as are couetous and malicious be faithlesse; and therefore by the lawes imperiall not eligible to the place of Princes or Generals of Armies.

For Generals which are blotted with couetousnesse can neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> attaine the true faith and loue of their souldiers; as by manifold example and experience is found: they should therefore consider what the conditions of some speciall gallant captaines in former ages haue bene in that case; and

they shall find <hi>Alexander</hi> munificent, <hi>Caesar</hi> magnificent, <hi>Cirus</hi> bountifull; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> amongst priuate Generals and Captaines that <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> was a man that onely protested against the desire of money, and treasure, when (after his conquest of all Afrike which he made tributarie to the Romanes) he could not shew any spoiles or booties of that warre vpon his returne, but onely the bare title of <hi>Africanus,</hi> which enlarged and famoused his name. Good gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and captaines therefore should imitate such honour, as those two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble brethren <hi>Publius, and Lucius Scipio,</hi> which were called the two thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boults of warre: for they protested that neither the treasures of Carthage nor of all Asia could make them auaricions; but that the riches (of which they were possessed, and had got from others) did wholie consist vpon emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and enuy; not vpon money. A worthie precedent amongst many more remaineth liuing in the legend of Phocion, that noble generall of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens surnamed <hi>Bonus Pauper,</hi> honorably recorded in <hi>Plutarches</hi> histories: whose condition was to contemne riches so farre, that when certaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors from <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedonia did present vnto him huge heapes of treasure, and kingly giftes, hee did peremptorily refuse them: the reguard of his owne desert, nor the benefit of his children (both which they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge vnto him) would not enduce <hi>Phocion</hi> to receaue them: but out of his singular magnificence and magnanimitie (dismissing the legates loaden as the came) answered them on this fashion. If my sonnes follow their fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, this little land in my possession (which maintained me in martiall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vntill I was promoted to this dignitie) may competently serue them: But if they degenerate, I doe not purpose with my gaines or gettings to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their riot.

Adde vnto these seueritie which doth purchase this benefit in a Commander, when no man in Campe nor Garison offending, can expect more fauour then is limited by the Lawes of Armes. For soldiers (albeit they delight in lenitie) contemne milde captaines such as <hi>Scipio</hi> was, whom <hi>Fabius</hi> therefore accused to the Senate, as a corruptor of the Romane militarie discipline.

            <p>There is a needfull kinde of discipline required in generals and chieftaines, which punisheth priuate wrongs in their souldiers mutually done amongst themselues: for otherwise they would fall to quarrels, disgraces, factions, and mutinies.

Infinite of these examples in my knowledge &amp; such as are vulgarly knowen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to souldiers, I pretermit in this point; only this is a certaine trueth, that if a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate souldier or other person not priuate being grieuously disgraced or iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at his fellowes hands, cannot vpon complaint made vnto the magistrate &amp; commander find redresse, it is full of perill to them that should order the same. For men in grieuous wronges are naturally couetous and eager of vengeance, which some stubborne and implacable hearts will prosecute with all violence to the preiudice &amp; confusion of their contrey, rather then faile: for wrath hath no power to retaine either reason or mediocritie, when it is once vnquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly kindled with the wild fire of vengeance; but outrageously tyrannizeth in extreames, negligently, but more fiercely rather rushing and encountring with the ruine of it selfe, &amp; the confusion of all things next it, which it eagerly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> deuoureth: and they that are of that fierie me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Such therefore as propose honor for the meed of their trauels are cold, reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, of a quiet and vnbroken spirit, knitting vp all their vertues in that action to which the whole force of mind &amp; bodie must be bent: not fighting to winne the girland for others, but principally proposing the wagers honour for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: &amp; hence happeneth that mercenaries cannot combat with that true cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and martiall-alacritie which natiue contrimen will: for they fight only for a little wages; and such venture of life, and hazard of themselues will not serue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in time of neede, vnlesse it be very wonderfully seconded with frequent, and those gallant succours, knowing how many noble princes haue miscarried in reposing vpon such hollow valours. Moreouer natiue souldiers both by the causes necessity, and in hope of a glorious conquest wherin the largest portion of iust reputation happeneth to themselues, wil put to their most excellent and best approued force; to such men feare and difficulties are contemptible: the cause of this their excellent valor proceedeth from the goodnesse of a true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in person of their prince, who will share his honors &amp; commodities with them, and from the noble worthinesse of their commaunders and leaders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natiue contrimen and engraffed to their societies. <hi>Tullus Hostilius</hi> succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Numa, notwithstanding the fourtie yeeres intermission from warre did onely choose his souldiers out of his owne cities reiecting all auxilia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The best forme of fighting in warre was in making of great battailes, being composed of the most approued men in field for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, placed in the maine battaile or middle bodie of the hoast: for men which being vnited fight together in multitudes, be much more valiant by nature then in small companies or handfuls. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>
            </p>
            <p>Also the speciall thing which hangeth vpon the discipline and honour of the Generall, is that the souldiers be duely paid their wages, and relieued with victuals, which winneth in them a dutifull kind of reuerence and awfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their gouernours. This loue in them exceedeth the force of gold, and the power of all opportunities and occasions, which can happen by times or places. For that which maintaineth wars commonly proceedeth from contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the people towards the common defence against forren violence; and this lasteth no longer then they can be defended. Likewise all places na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally munited and fortified are nothing without the willing aide of men valiant to defend them by force: considering that treasure is wonne by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> sword, and not the swords vertue by treasure. These foure points in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, therefore make excellent souldiers, and confirme Empire: Industrious and due discipline, strong armes and sufficient for the fight, iust paiment of wages, and a competent prouision of victuals; adde hereunto the fift (which is the roote, mother, and perfection of all noble seruice and conquest) being the firme loue &amp; hearty reuerence of the souldiers. These points which haue beene formerly noted by the politicke Florentine Secretarie to <hi>Petro de Medici</hi> to conserue and augment, th'empire which he would haue had him haue sought for, consist in manning of the strong cities with souldiers, borne in the same prouinces, in conciliating the friendship and societies of neighbours, in planting colonies for defence vpon the skirts of their newly subdued pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in the spoiles of enemies, in forraging and hauocking vpon their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest and husbandrie, in choosing rather to draw them together for battell in Campe, then to besiege them within their cities, in studious respect of the common cause and profit onely, in th'instructing and disciplining of souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the knowledge and vse of armes; which eight points, if the prince or lieuetenant neglect, hee may percase deuise notwithstanding other meanes for the conseruation of his owne, but neuer for the amplification of Empire; which augmentation if it should happen by lawfull meanes, as by the meere prouidence, suggestion, and disposition of God doth not impugne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Christian religion, but is most noble and loueable.</p>

            <p>There yet appendeth this discipline of souldiers, one principall respect of the captaines, that neither they crush nor excoriate the poore husband-man, which I partly touched in the Morals of my second Booke: for if it may be said vnto fraudulent mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (whose consciences are blasted with a couetous lethargie) Whether O yee fooles shall your soules trauell?

yet (being vnfortunately vanquished by his enemies) <hi>Athens</hi> that vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> citie, would neither receiue nor protect him, comming thither for refuge, where he was the shield-herne before: whereat <hi>Demetrius</hi> was more vexed then for the losse of his whole estate.

Neither can it be spoken what incouragement it addeth to the souldier, faint and wearied with blood and conflict, when hee seeth new succours freshly charging and participating of their trauels with martiall alacritie. Neither is it a small terror to the enemies, weakened, alayed and surrounded with the stubborne blowes of their enemies to finde and feele fresh gallants proudly marching, and come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to tyrannize ouer the bodyes and spirits of their aduersaries, already wearied and halfe dead which grew faint and feeble with continuance in fight, leauing not any member of the opposite battels free from blood and wounds.</p>

or other occasion loose the field: it is great wisdome in the General religiously <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to let them know that their neglect, or contempt of Gods feare and seruice hath driuen them into the feare and seruitude of men, and also prophetically with a vehement maiestie to threaten vnto them the iudgements of God in their slackenesse, encouraging such in their eager sharpenesse &amp; iolly resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onseither by some valorous example in himselfe, as that victorious Emperour <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> did in his warres against the Galles, when he from a faint thearted souldier that doubted of victorie, did snatch a shield, where withall couering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> himselfe, he did most eagerly fight, infusing a liuely fortitude and stedfast reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to his desparing souldiers, by that notable example in himselfe, which drew them into the field of victorie: or by some other diuine meanes and promises when they shall find it most fit; as the Romanes which at the long siege of Veij growing wearie, and coueting to returne vnto their houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods at Rome, their captaines wished them to persist in honorable valor vnder a religious pretext; signifying that the lake Albanus ouerflowing, pretended the subuersion of that citie the same yeere, according to th'oracle. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (by whose prediction it happened) for to confirme the souldiers more in those his presages was left captiue at Rome, vntill th'oracle was accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. And hence was it that the souldiers recouering more spirits in heart did continue their assiege, and within that yeeres limite possessed the towne. The like was seene in <hi>Beleses</hi> a Babilonian, skilfull of the Caldean auguries and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uination, who by the starres presaged a subuersion of the Assyrian monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And certaine it is that the force of religion will vehemently moue souldiers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue valiant in assurance of victorie, by diuers examples out of <hi>Liuie,</hi> when their estates were most desperate and remedilesse; yeelding a diuine force and light vnto their actions, if the captaines can by stratagemmes to themselues onely knowen, harden their resolutions to performe what they shall deuise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> not making them acquainted with any thing sauing execution. It is likewise a principall part of the Generals duetie, that (before the battell, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning, when they be brought by troupes into the plaine, to be reduced into rankes or Battagliaes, likewise at euening after their marches before their comming into the quarter; moreouer during the fight, and after the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) his speciall care tend, that diuers Chaplaines, Priests and Preachers make deuoute prayers, intercessions, and spirituall exhortations through his whole hoast, which hath alwayes beene most auaileable.

            <p>For the beleaguriag, surprizing, taking in, and fortifying of townes, bulwarkes, castles, fortresses, sconces, and other defences, I referre it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to the knowledge of captaines and souldiers experienced. Onely this for that we reade it from the wisedome and sacred institution of God in <hi>Deutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cap. 20.</note> that at sh'assiege of any citie captaines should first offer peace; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>if they that be distressed make peaceable offers, or offer peaceable conditions they should haue peace graunted vnto them, and bee made tributaries and seruants vnto their conquerers: but if they should in obstinate heart continue warre, then should the aduersarie maintaine his siege:</hi> For saith he, <hi>God will deliuer them into thyhands; then put all the male children to sword, reseruing the women and all other goods for thy seruice and commoditie. Cut not downe any fruit trees, for they shall serue for thy comfort and sustenance; but of all other trees which are fit to further the assiege and serue for fortification, to make bridges, or to staunche moates and dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Romanes in surprisall or taking in of citties, would not endure the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> needlesse charge of long sieges; and therefore they wonne all townes, either by force apparant, or stratagemme. By force, as either with sudden and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected assaults, by scaling ladders and multitudes of souldiers seconding one another in their scaladoes; and that was commonly performed with one dayes seruice, as <hi>Scipio</hi> tooke in Carthage: or if with more time then they did vse <note place="margin">Vide Liuiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 26. Vide Liuium lib. 5.</note> rammes, engines, vnderminings; as the citie Veij was wonne by raising vp of wooden frames or turrets higher then the walles from whence the souldier might wound and distresse with diuers darts, arrowes, slinges, crossebowes and other weapons, such as kept within the walles for defence and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the citie: insomuch as the walles being battered with rammes, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> citisens relieued themselues; as other townes and peeces at this day doe, when they repaire the breaches of cannons, by retiring or filling and refo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Their pyoners likewise countermining against their opposite minings, as in this age is vsuall resisting them in issue with pikes and such wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons as serue fittest. They did also staunch vp their enemies minings with strawe, brimestone, oyle, feathers, or such filth: which being set on fire within the close and dampish earth would choke, vp ordriue them backe with grosse smoke and noisome sauour.</p>
            <p>The course of winning such places (as before I noted) is by mixt force or stratagemme; as also by secret conspiracies or confederacies, as in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> certaine the principall gouernors, or captaines of those townes or pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and yet there is danger in reposing trust or credite in such mercenarie faith, which is not commonly current. For the whole state of an Armie,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7338:101"/>
(which is indeed the carcasse of a kingdome) may not onely be grieuously <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> wounded, but irreuocably broken by that meanes: or it may percase be laid open by some accident or other. As it of late dayes happened when <hi>Vlissingen</hi> should haue beene taken in, Sir <hi>Robert Sidney Vicount Lysle</hi> Gouernour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had notice of the trecherie by very strange meanes and vnexpected, by which the plots may be confounded. Certaine places may bee wonne by traine vnder trust: as <hi>Amiens</hi> was taken by the stratagemme of carts, about nine yeeres sithence. To stand longer vpon such deuises being so frequent and well knowne to militarie gouernours and masters, were intirely needlesse, referring them to <hi>Caesar, Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Liuie,</hi> whose Hystories are fully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with mater of that nature. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>
            </p>
            <p>In the assiege of any Towne or Peece whatsoeuer being strongly muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the principall course is to begin with all violence, and to take away from the besieged all future meanes and hopes of lingring and protracting suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours. For the procrastination or protraction of one day, or houre in such seruices (whereby the distressed Citizens or souldiers might haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued in the delay) may draw with it sufficient opposition to remoue the assiege, and to deliuer the places from all danger. It is also most perilous in contrary to the defence and fortification of any Towne (being vehemently beleaguered by force) to linger out in hope of succours, vntill they come to the very centre of all extremitie; for then remedies and meanes of all sortes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> are altogether fruitlesse, and vnprofitable to people in such a lamentable case, being inuironed and neere oppressed with their enemies, when the poyson hath already dispersed it selfe through the heart veines.</p>

            <p>In the conquest and surprisall of Kingdomes, Prouinces, Cities, or Castles, the true touch of a noble Generall is seen, in his prohibiting and cohibiting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of all violence vsed against women, punishing with death according to marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all lawes, the rapes &amp; constuprations of matrons and virgines, emblasoning in his whole apport vpon the victory, with all heroycall humiliation &amp; modesty, that honor which so mightily magnified <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> vpon his surprisall
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7338:101"/>
of <hi>Carthage.</hi> For (hauing at the sacke thereof a captiue virgin of incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> beautie, presented vnto him by certaine of his captaines which had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her) he with most singular and gracious humanitie, preciously valuing and prising her honour as his owne, did not onely with great gifts and iewels which he bestowed vpon her, but without any blemish or assiege laid vnto her maiden-head gloriously dismisse her with a conuoy. Which that noble (though vnfortunate) Lord <hi>Robert Deuereux</hi> late Earle of Essex, Anno 1596. declared at Cadiz: where like a true <hi>Scipto</hi> both in valour and discipline, hee left the spoyles of that towne in speciall to his souldiers reseruing for himselfe as his owne share inualuable, a right renouned and infinite bruit of his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which vpon that felicitie like a cannon shot suddenly battered and made a breach in the rebated spirits of Spaine: the report of which noble peece <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was heard farre beyond the extremest confines of Christendome; insomuch that the Mahemitane Monarch hearing of that sudden braue, seconded the scoffe (which his Predecessor had darted at king <hi>Philip</hi> the second An. 1588.) with another harsh taunt more bitterly relished. By which meanes the fame of that noble warrior grew so great, that our Soueraigne (which had not beene knowne to diuers Potentates of this world) was by the bruit of his valour and victories made famous, and immortall also. I cannot sufficiently set downe what in my iudgement, and by the relation of very iust and wise men of his secrets I haue considered and conceiued of that noble warrior: Howbeit thus much as the least of my iust obsequies to so renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed a Lord, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> neuer was heard (that euer I could heare) to haue gloried or boasted of his victories, or fortunate seruices: but in all his actions ciuile or military did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all with ioyfull humblenesse and thanks-giuing to God, and to the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall wisedom and direction of his Prince, as a seruant and minister of theirs. And thus by specious declaration of his vertue in obedience, and of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie in speech, he still liued free from malice; and yet as a royall Deere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pasturing within the golden pale of glorie. Howbeit (to his owne so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine dissolution, and to the dolorous downe fall and heauinesse of his many friends which fell with him, and which lamented for him long after him) hee found it and left it which was by <hi>Tacitus</hi> written as a position infallible to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> pondered amongst all ambitious and aspiring subiects or other great ones, which cannot set limits to their owne appeties, <hi>Quam formidolosum sit pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uati hominis gloriam supraprincipis attolli:</hi> Which might be verified also by the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who (though protected by the great prouidence of God) being but a shepheard (as I touched in my second Booke) to raigne in Israel; yet was (notwithstanding all his vertues, and honour in marrying king <hi>Saul</hi> his daughter) in danger to loose his life, by many trecherous conspiracies and attempts of his vnthankfull father in law. But that I may speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of him according to true iudgement and indifferencie: because parad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture some haue either maleuolently with exceeding bitternesse abused his honorable ashes contumeliously; and others percase which haue as blindly in the contrary sanctified him as one more then a man beyonde his deserts, and the measure of his nature: both which are most odious to the true taste of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7338:102"/>
all noble natures: I say thus much, which they (that wisely did know him) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> will acknowledge also. His minde was incomprehensible: by nature, a man much addicted to pleasures, but much more to glorie. If he were at any time luxurious (which some very impudently haue thrust vpon his dead coffin, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all truth and modestie) it was very little, and that when hee was idle, which was very sildome: howbeit neuer could any delicacies or corporall comforts drawe him (since he was imployed in the publike counsels of his Prince and countrey) to neglect any serious businesse. He was eloquent, and well knew the guilefull trappes &amp; insidious treacheries of this world, by good experience and much reading. He was affable and soone any mans friend, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that was either by friendes commended vnto him, or had any specious appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of good qualities in him. The loftinesse of his wit (as I may most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly terme it) was most quick, present and incredible: in dissembling with counterfeit friends, and in concealing of any matter and businesse of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, beyond expectation. He was bountifull, magnificent and liberall in all the course of his life, hauing commended multitudes of people vnto liuings, pensions, preferments, &amp; great sums of money, as appeared both by the land of his owne, which he sould and ingaged to maintaine the same; and by the large dispensation of his Soueraignes treasure committed to his trust and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. And which I may speake in truth most boldly, his fortune was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> good before, as appeared in France and Cadiz; but much inferior to his valorous industrie (which with the great and weightie hammer of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and engine, did strike diuine beames and noble sparkes from the anuile of glorie) vntill his late vnfortunate voyage in Anno 1597. and that his other pestilent and inauspicious expedition for Ireland: before which times it was difficult to be discerned, whether his valour or fortune were more. I my selfe a Boy, haue seene him in the French-warres to communicate in sports and sometimes in serious matters with men of meane condition and place, their fortunes and parentage valued; to bee delighted and exercised in labouring with the mattock in trenches, fosses, and in other workes amongst his battels; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to be busied in setting of watches, in making of barricadoes at his quarter, and in often walking the round. Also that vice (which contagious ambition much affecteth) could neuer be noted in him; which was to detract from the credite and good fame of any his fellowes in her Maiesties counsell, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absent, or of any other man: only this it went neere him and laie heauie to his heart, that any of them should be thought more wise or valiant then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, being scarce a vice, but emulation rather proceeding from the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his spirit; and (without doubt) he did exceed many of them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things. By which meanes, euen as <hi>Salust</hi> describeth <hi>Sylla,</hi> so did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come precious in presence of his souldiers. From his child-hood hee was hardened with exercise, taking pleasure and some trauaile and labours which other men for the most part would haue reputed miseries and calamities. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> His apprehension and prudence was admirable, by which he would and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times did preuent and turne the mischiefes and fallacies of his enemies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their owne heads; he was circumspect in all matters appertaining his owne
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7338:102"/>
office and charge; and would not endure, if by any meanes, counsell, or engine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he could deuise, to leaue any safe euasions or munitions offensiue or defensiue with his enemies. And that which was most rare in so great a captaine (though in discipline of warre, he declared himselfe seuere as was fit, meeke and honourable towards his captaines which had well deserued) neither did his mildnesse and facilitie withdraw from his reputation, nor his seueritie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the loue of his souldiers: onely this to conclude of him in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a Generall. The end of his life was much lamented by the better and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler part of his countrimen, it was very grieuous to them that were his friends and louers, it was pitied and repined against with a certaine kinde of regret by forrenners and strangers, which had heard of his valour, and those enemies or emulators rather of his heroicall vertues in Spaine and France, which had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> felt the weight of his valour, reioyced not vpon report of his death. I would if it had so pleased God, that he might haue died in the warres vpon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his countrey, that I might heroically with good cheere haue registred his death in these offices: to conclude with his discription of body briefly being the same, with that which <hi>Tacitus</hi> did write of <hi>Iulius Agricola: decentior quam sublimior fuit, nihil metus in vultu, gratia oris supererat, bonum virum facile credideres, magnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> libentèr.</hi> He was tall and in authoritie, yet was he more come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then loftie: in his forehead and countenance much valour and boldnesse were imprinted and expressed, his lookes were very gratious; they that had iudiciously beheld him, would haue easily beleeued that he was a very good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> man, and would haue bene very glad to haue knowen him a mightie man: and that which was most rare and admirable in men of our age, in his distresse and calamities, his mind was not onely great and noble like his blood and and place, but much loftier and firmer, then in his most firme honours, and prosperitie. And so much in briefe, so neere as I could, haue I done to life, the morall qualities and perfections of that heroicall Generall without adulation or partialitie. Now because I would be short, I will speake somewhat of some other respects and obseruations required in the person of a Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
            <p>First therefore let all conditions of peace or truce with any people besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or besieged (if they be cleare from any suspition of concealed daunger, yeelding meanes of quiet without more perill of further expense in future) be generally liked and embraced: but if they breede any buds or tokens of the contrarie, let a wise captaine or gouernour shew speciall circumspection, least a pernicious and bloodie warre lurke vnder such insidious and perfidious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of peace, and some pestilent poyson be ministred in steede of wholesome phisicke. In all wounds, extreamities, and miseries he must repute of death as of the consummation of all calamities, and not as a vexation, that death dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> all mortall perturbations: otherwise there cannot any place be left for griefe or ioy. He must therefore to be short be partaker of prudence as I said before; because all aduantages in fight are attained thereby: for by that vertue, neither feare nor furie can dazell his vnderstanding. And therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> saith that in warre prudence is principally to bee required. And

These are my images, this is my nobilitie not left by inheritance as other men haue had their honours; but these my dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities haue I with my many labours and perils sought &amp; attained: I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how to wound mine aduersarie, to raise Garrisons, to stand in feare of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but of bad report: to beare with patience, cold and heat alike, to sleepe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and rest my wearie car case vpon the ground, at one time to tollerate hunger, thirst, and labour: with these perils will I persuade my souldiers; neither will I straiten them or see them euill intreated, when I haue plentie my selfe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will I make their labours my glory: this is a profitable and ciuill Empire. And these obseruations by the patterne of noble <hi>Marius</hi> will hearten and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Generals and captaines vnto true discipline and vertues.</p>
            <p>These and such qualities of the like heroicall nature made the Romanes victorious, inciting and pricking vp their souldiers to paines and valour. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would these renouned Romane Generals (as I haue partly noted else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) oppresse or deale extremely with any people whom they conquered, but they did repute it to be their greatest maiesty to prohibit iniuries, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to suffer any man by wicked meanes to dilate his Empire. Besides, for disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline (because it is one speciall thing which should be remembred) and I haue in diuers places mentioned the same, being a thing so necessary to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that without it the fight or battels where euill instructed souldiers are
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7338:103"/>
is more like to <hi>Latrociny</hi> then true warre. Horsemen in confused troupes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> order or true direction of their Guydes &amp; Cornets: foot-men interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with them not knowing how to draw themselues into rankes, and fyles, by due forme &amp; order of battell, but many times at vnawares wounding, slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and mayming one another, striking their enemies behind their backes, without honourable respect like brute beasts and sauages, and finally leauing themselues a spoyle and shame to their enemies, their children and posteritie slaues to forreners, their Countrey the inheritance of ambitious and vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable vsurpers, besides a perpetuall record of shame in all Hystories insuing. How needfull therefore it is for Captaines to see their souldiers well armed, well practized in vse of Armes, and well disciplined, concerning their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in the warres, is most apparant, when after a field by such negligence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and confusion lost, they shall see their virgins and daughters rauished and deflowred, their male-children captiued or murdered, some of them vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently torne from the bosomes &amp; imbracements of their parents, the mothers of children and of Families in presence of their owne husbands violently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and prostituted to the reasonlesse wills and lustes of the Conquerers, their Churches, holy things, houses, and treasures to bee spoyled and borne away before their eyes, murther and fire to rage euery where in their desolate townes and cities; lastly, no place of their countrey to be free from Armes, dead corpses, blood and lamentation euery where scattered. Which things being so certaine and well considered, how needfull it is to discipline, instruct <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and incourage souldiers in the loue and ready practise of armes and of true valour is most euident, and ought to be the principall care of all heroycall Captaines, which should neuer cease either meditating or practising to make their souldiors vnder their charge so perfect, resolute, obedient and valiant, as nothing may be thought to them on earth impregnable.</p>
            <p>And albeit the fortune of war consisteth alwayes vpon difficult and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine termes, yet most certaine it is that true valour mingled with absolute dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in souldiers, maketh a tryumphant Monarchie. For what more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent spectacle can there be to them that are Lordes and conquerors, through their good disposition and gouernment, then in the open fieldes to pursue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their enemies in slight? to wound, slaughter, and captiuate them? to see their horses with the riders distressed? to see many of them which haue receiued wounds neither to find chirurgerie, nor meanes of escape? some of them des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately to resist, and presently to fall downe? lastly to see the whole Campe couered with weapons, armor, and dead bodies, and the ground dyed into purple with their enemies blood? All which noble obiects and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come onely by good discipline.</p>
            <p>But for somuch as true fortitude, which is lincked in the golden armelet of other Morall vertues, and participateth with the rest is one and the noblest Counsellor, and executioner of all the worthie designes of a prudent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> I will therefore deliuer the members of that principle in moralitie.</p>
            <p>Fortitude is an affection or habite of the minde, which vndergoing all honorable dangers, labours, and mischieous hazards considerately, represseth
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7338:104"/>
feare and wrath: the corporall enemies of it are sicknesse and pouertie, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> opposites, disgrace, iniurie, rebuke: it holdeth at defiance death, dolour and feare. He therefore that is truely valiant sheweth himselfe to be more than a man, as <hi>Seneca</hi> seemeth to witnesse.

            <p>Stoutnesse and magnanimitie which vndertaketh and endureth all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7338:104"/>
with patience and perseuetance, being the substance and essence thereof, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is incorporate to fortitude.</p>
            <p>Stoutnesse is a stedfast confidence of minde, armed with assured trust and hope in great and honourable actions. Audaciousnes contrarieth it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consideration, iudgement, and respect of honestie, violently and rashly precipitating it selfe into perils: whereas stoutnesse attempted with reason, warie respect, great boldnesse and moderation of the minde being inseperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fastned vnto vertue nobly worketh in the turbulent seas of danger. Pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimitie which is a base deiection or rather desperation of the mind opposeth it, yet commonly pursuing temeritie, by the example of <hi>Philip</hi> late King of Spaine, which (amongst other his vnaduised attempts, wherein the salt of warie premeditation was forgotten) luculently, to Gods vnspeakable glorie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> did appeare in his militarie businesse vndertaken against this nation (as I tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before) immaturely leuying armes not being soundly resolued how that action of such difficult and weightie consequence should bee managed or finished, wholy leaning vpon the fickle wheele of fortune, immesurably mounting in the pompe of his victories had in other places before, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through want of knowledge how to guide the gorgeous bridles of his prosperous tryumphes: but when the certaine successe of his shattered fleet (which inwardly daunced before, threatning the Brittaine seaes and shores, in foolish confidence of vndoubted conquest) had like a musket shaft peireed through his credulous eares to his trembling heart and late ambitious liuer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> where it was deeply fixed; then as a weake and sraile woman impatiently throwing from him all royall and princely thoughts and courage, passionatly did he teare off his owne beard, beating his forehead and breast impatiently, torturing himselfe with teares and lamentations in publike and priuat: vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which his disperation, waxing fearelesse of any tokens or care in himselfe to conserue his owne Realms (which had so fouldly mist in seeking to master ours) made such apparance of his basenesse and viletie, playing the lowly part of a weake and feeble woman (which he prouided for our diuine Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lady) that wise men did very iudiciously consider vpon it by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine circumstances, how Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might in the terror of that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which thundred in Spaine amongst the <hi>Castillian</hi> courages, haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily with a small power subiected that nation thereupon.</p>
            <p>Magnanimitie being the greatnesse of a mind inuincible and mightie, the noble strength and stedfastnesse in execution of great and waightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, doth support and corroborate stoutnesse. Know therefore that heart to be noblest and most honourable in quest of all vertues, which is open, simple, without hypocrisie, graue, modest, repressing pride, meerely great, forgetfull of iniuries done to it selfe, gentle, aiming at eternitie, contemning terrestrial benefits, readier to giue then to receiue, more studious of iust praise then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. For this kind of nobilitie, contemneth that greatnesse which the profane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vulgar admireth so much, conuersing in the restraint of all perturbations, in victorious resistance of all ambition, auarice, and fleshly desires; that it may with more constancie resist other calamities. This is seene in both prosperous

and aduerse chaunces when a man is not altered through either, but endureth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> constant and the same in all.</p>
            <p>Haughtinesse aspiring from a stubborne and fastidious spirit, and heart swolne vp with the poyson of pride, which violently rauisheth humane reason, and base abiection being the vilenesse and filth of mind are daungerous out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawes, trangressing beyond the borders of magnanimitie. From the first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth braggerie, foolish boasting and ostentation which issueth from fol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e blinded in louing conceit and admiration of some worthinesse which they misconceiue in themselues; being a most ridiculous vice to be represented in enterlude by the person of <hi>Thraso,</hi> wholie repugnant to goodnesse and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, hatefull in the thoughts of all honest men, and acceptable to parasites <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> onely. Tke second being a foule abiection, and beastly downefall of mind eschewing labour, and neglecting matters of most moment, in feare of some griefe and care which accompaineth it, is altogether sopped and steeped in sluggishnesse: such brutish people faint and languish in the quest of honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and important affaires as <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> and <hi>Heliog abalus</hi> did. Vnto these alreadie mentioned, adde a desire of good fame; opposite to which is ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and neglect of honest report, of impudencie: but a moderate desire of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which is placed betwixt ambition and the contempt of dignitie meerely proceeding from a mind that aspireth to the reward of her vertues, is in my iudgement laudable and ambicious: if I dare make a maxim positiuely of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> holdeth ambiguously for a paradox. But to conclude with this vertue magnanimitic, Philosophers thinke it to be the rule how to desire and seeke for honour by due desert, moderating and directing humane appetite in the acquisition of great and mightie matters: her sisters accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are humilitie, patience, magnificence, and mansuetude, which is a calme spirit interset betwixt wrath and indulgence: the meanes to restraine wrath and hatred are, not to be couetous of vengeance, seldome though sometimes vpon iust cause to be angry, to wrong and vexe no man, for enuie dependeth vpon wrath. Securitie and licence of sinne followeth excessiue indulgence: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and I am perswaded that no man which is truely valiant, can truely be said en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious though most of them are emulous:</p>
            <p>Patience which is a vertue, fencing and preparing a souldiers mind against all wounds inflicted in fight, teacheth a Generall, and all sorts of souldiers, how to strengthen, exercise, and encourage themselues in all commendable hardnesse &amp; difficulties; as noble <hi>Cato</hi> of Vtica did in Africke instruct his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, how to beare themselues amongst a swarme of mortall stings, &amp; how to suffer heat, hunger, &amp; thirst, sickenesse; for this vertue fenceth and prepareth his mind against all wounds inflicted in fight: and <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> likewise whom I mentioned in my second booke. That Generall therefore which is verely valiant, will in the effusion and smoking current of his owne blood (that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> from him washeth away all spots of shame and deformities) fight most eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, considering that his most grace and highest commendation in conflict is to stand stedfast foote to foote, without giuing any ground, or turning his face away from the aduersarie, vnlesse good aduantages and opportunities require

            <p>If therefore the Generall would haue his souldiors ambitious of honour, and victorie, he must worke out their resolution, and with vertuous example in himselfe apparant encourage their actions. For if he will industriously consider, and declare his true force (which is in most high reputation fixed) he shall finde it very possible for him to infuse power sufficient to his soldiers, for performance of any reasonable action in their charge, working first confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in them, which onely proceedeth from good militarie discipline: let him therfore with great grace and wisedome endeuour to make his name and honor, reuerende, and precious throughout his whole armies, which he shall purchase as (I say before) by mingling of charitie with discipline; as in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care that he surbate not his footemen with long and grieuous hard mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, forsomuch as warriors of best iudgement and experience haue alwayes esteemed them more seruiceable then the horse: which hath beene found as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well amongst the battels of the Greekes and Romanes, as in ours of these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times in Christendome: for vpon vrgent causes it may bee that by fast troupes and marches or with long fight and escairmouches they may become wearie: whereupon it will be most conuenient to relieue them with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of those Caualliers that ride, the whiles they for their more ease in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> refresh themselues with marching on foote in their places interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as the Romanes <hi>Ad lacum regi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The fauteries there of being in principal place of seruice are to be cheerefully cherished and disciplined aboue others. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>There is also required in the Generall, one speciall point towards the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration of his souldiers hearts. First to shew religion in the obseruing and performing articles and promises: secondly that vpon the point of seruice he declare vnto his souldiers in honest and familiar wordes of comfort, the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and easiest meanes of victorie, wherein it behoueth him to conceale all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments; or (if they be pregnant) then to extenuate them by some cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ingeniou excuse, which hath in it a strong taste of a true fortitude. These with some other heads, such as before and after are expressed (as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion offereth) will generally renowne the Generall, and further the victorie. There are some souldiers which haue a vertuous boldnesse and ferocitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mixt with martiall instruction and seueritie, from which skill and perfection that fiercenesse and confidence in the souldier is vttered: the like was in those ancient Romane armies, when they by such auspicious meanes, came home vnder their victorious ensignes, alwayes loaden with rich spoyles &amp; triumphs.

By the inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable benefit of this reason, which deepely groundeth it selfe in knowledge and continuall search of hidden treasures, the Generall becommeth iust, skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and industrious: in it are rooted all his present resolutions which happen vpon extremities during the fight, and seasoned with that good fortune, with that prudent and quicke apprehension, which like the sudden flash of a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not so quicke as diuine giueth a sweete fire to the true touch of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; when mature deliberations want space of admittance, and onely fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> executions are importuned and instantly.</p>
            <p>From this florisheth out his diligence, patience, prudence, mildnesse, sterne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, subtiltie, simplicitie, warinesse, promptnesse, liberalitie, with many more branches of true vertue springing together, out of that one most boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull roote.

Besides, that the perfect knowledge of countries, fennes, marshes, and riuers, for marching, incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wading, fortifying, imbattelling, and such like by such practise of hunting, shall be with sport and in short time attained: also the benefit happening to their bodies in confirming of their strength and health which vse it. For by this countries Topographie, a perfit knowledge and discretion (of the nature, condition and soyle of other countries) is attained with facilitie: for all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions haue some resemblance one of another. In such sort <hi>Salust</hi> (writing somewhat concerning the exercise which <hi>Iugurth</hi> did vse) commendeth him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> after a fashion for his exercise of hunting in these words; <hi>Non se luxui nequè in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertiae corrumpendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dedit sed (vti mos gentis illius est) equitare, iaculari, cursu cum ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualibus certare: &amp; cum omnes gloria antecelleret omnibus tamen charus esse.

Moreouer he bestowed much time in hunting, he would be the first man or the surest man which gored, wounded, or paunched the Lion and other wild <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> beasts: his fashion was to do very much, &amp; to make small brags of it. In which generous exercise &amp; recreation of hunting, your highnesse (soone after your first milke in the tendernesse of your gracious spring) industriously &amp; to great good end delighted hauing proposed it as a recreation destined to most noble and heroicall purposes, when time and occasion should summon your migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse, to make specious demonstration thereof. And that care and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is exceeding great, which answereth to the choosing of a Generall; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for his reason experience, and valour, as for his bodilie strength and agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for that cause the people of Rome (hauing decreed by the consent of the Senate, to moue warre against any Nation) made choise of their Generals <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and Dictators out of the prudentest Consuls: vnto whom they graunted a large Commission to deale in all causes (concerning the seruice in their trust) according to their sound discretions. And verely (whereas both the life and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7338:109"/>
honor of peace and warre resteth in his person) the wise iudgement of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Prince (as I thinke) cannot bee so certainly in substitution and deputation of any vicegerent or seruaunt whatsoeuer, as in the prudent election of a Generall. For certainely those noble parts and perfections (which are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully required in him) stand in more force and valour of all inferiour soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers vnder him: as <hi>Philip</hi> great <hi>Alexanders</hi> father said, <hi>That a battell of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were gouerned by a Stagge, could not be so good as an hoast of stagges vnder the conduct of a Lyon:</hi> for of Cowards (hauing able bodies) a gallant Generall may with some conuenient paines and good discipline make victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious warriours; as <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas</hi> did of the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> by whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> they were enfranchised from the <hi>Spartans;</hi> and albeit in regard of their long slauerie some deemed them vnfit for militarie seruice, yet did these Captaines so labour in disciplyning of them, as they did proue soone after able, and vanquishers ouer them, that so tyrannized ouer them before. In honour of which nation, and vpon their good successe it was written, how not onely the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> but euen all other sorts of people would become gallant fellowes and victorious through good martiall instruction &amp; practise, which ought to proceed at all times both in peace and warre.

            <p>It is also common in nature, that in laudable qualities (especially where multitudes may be witnesses of their excellent readinesse and resolution) men loftily will performe the parts of their cunning with great hope, whereas the rude and vnexercised souldior is like a sheepe exposed to slaughter.

               </gap>ks and files, then either the first or second, being so fashioned, that one battelle might for more strength and aduantage draw it selfe into another, when oddes or any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie did constraine, without disorder or confusion: to each of which three <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> battels were assigned certaine cornets of horse, which like winges guarded the right and left flancke of each battell; onely the first battell of pikes stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nearer then the rest in ranckes and files (as our battels of forelorne hope at this day) were so perfectly taught and instructed, that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter endure the first brunt or charge when it should come to their turne for fight; the second battell of those principals and strong men which followed, being larger in space to receiue the pikes vpon occasion by retire, and the <hi>Triarij</hi> so large as would admit them both vpon necessitie to their ranckes without confusion: but when the <hi>Triarij</hi> haue both receiued the pikes and principals into their battels, then they forthwith close their ranckes and with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> most resolute and victorious courage endure and surrechardge vpon their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in a terrible fashion; which finding a new battell stronger and more puisant then both the first (vniting them that were driuen backe) are frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all hope and courage.

            <p>Now for asmuch as it behoueth to reason a little of martiall stratagems seruing for campe or any place fortified, I will take occasion in this place to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> discourse somewhat. Subtilties though in priuate actions they be detestable, yet are in militarie seruices very commendable, and commonly more worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then open force is against enemies: howbeit fraud in the violation of faith or breach of conditions (amongst men in armes) is excepted. For these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesties,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7338:111"/>
may percase augment Empire with assured losse of honour much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> more precious. The subtilties of which I speake, are the substance of stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems by subduing of professed enemies, and by diffidence had of their opposits: such (as for instance) <hi>Anniball ad lacum Perusinum</hi> vsed by turning face from the Romanes his enemies, that the Consull and his hoast by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute, might be brought into places full of danger. And hereupon note by the way, that if thine aduersarie turne his backe towards you, pursue not in further heat and greedinesse of victorie, but rather according to the Prouerbe, <hi>Make him a siluer bridge to be gone:</hi> least being constrained to fight vpon neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie they become desperate, of which there is infinite example of diuers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pursued after the fight, which haue vpon that example finished in much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> effusion of blood, and victorious conquest had of them that followed. Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors therefore should neither be too slowe nor hastie, but keepe a prudent moderation; which temperature will guide them to many fortunate aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and executions: least that be verified vpon them which <hi>Iohn Basilides</hi> the Rushian Tyrant spake of the Moscouites and Polonians: that these were too forward, and those ouer backward, which hee by long experience found in his armies.</p>
            <p>Another excellent example of lawfull stratagem in the Captaine <hi>Annibal</hi> to secure himselfe and his armies is recorded, by tying matches and firebrands to the hornes of cattell driuing them by night a contrary way, to misguide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> his enemies, that in the meane while he might prouide for the safe allodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his owne forces.

            <p>There is yet another adiunct of wylinesse sometimes vsed in warre, which resteth in taking occasion vpon good aduantages to fight with confederates, and then the meane to worke it, is quarrelling or martially moouing against some other friend being with his confederate in confederacie; so that he must be forced in honesty to partake and breake truce with him that cunningly seeketh it, he giuing the first signall to Battell, or declare himselfe false or perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious towardes his friend and Client.

            <p>What I haue spoken here in particular respecting the office of a Leiutenant generall, may serue for other inferiour Captaines and Officers of warre also: Yet considering that it were semblably behoofull for me to declare what the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> places of most reputation are in the field, according to the seruice of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish warres; the brute, and ioyous rebounding honour of which battels haue formerly sounded aloud from their drums &amp; trumpets in the most flourishing parts of Christendome, I will brieflly touch them so neere in the sequell as I can gather.</p>
            <p>Next vnto the L. Leiutenant Generall, which absolutely representeth and vseth (for the time) the person and dignities of the Prince are these principall persons of honor, seruing as counsellors and assistants immediate and vnder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his Excellencie.</p>
            <p>The first place is assigned to the Lord Marischal; adioyning him the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell generall of foote, and he seconded with the Coronell generall of horse; ensuing them the Captaine or Coronell of euery Regiment or battell: after these the Campe-master, next him the master of the Ordinance: suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuely

the Treasurer of the whole hoast; and lastly the Sergeant maior ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in field: these be principals and of counsell to the L. Leiutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
            <p>There are Offices also deputing vnto the former, and some others which are not of such speciall reputation: as the Leiutenant to the Coronell of foote, Leiutenant of the Coronell of horse, the Prouost Marischall, the Muster-master generall, the Corporals of foote and horse, the Sergeants ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iors of euery battell or Regiment, the Scout-master, the Trench-master, the forrage-master, the prouant master, the captaine of the carriages, &amp; the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Pyoners; most of which are in office and degree superior to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate captaines of Companies. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord high Marischalls office (vpon which the whole charge of an Armie dependeth) is very noble, and commonly taketh the second place of honor in the field: it importeth him therefore of necessitie to know through what manner of ground the whole armie must passe; if in Champion, how the wayes open for rancks in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyes, or for battels; if in vallyes or lanes, how they be straitned for troupes and confused marches, hauing soundly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all meanes which may giue aduantage against the enemie, by march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, incamping, and disposing or ordering of his forces, noting with iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well experienced obseruation all the disabilities which his enemies must haue in meeting with him; eskairmouching or giuing present charge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> vpon his armies, here, there, or in any place in his way with such meanes as may be deuised how to redresse and recouer them from all dangers and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages of land, hill, or riuer in the way, making a safe and sure audite of the best &amp; worst of all which can happen, prouiding remedies against dangers if they chaunce, and redinesse with expedition towards the imbracement of all fortunate occasions. In him likewise is required perfectly to know the extreme force of his Prince for the present, and likewise the power of his enemies, what horse, what foote, what yong, what old instructed souldiers, what lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of note, experience, and valour, comparing one with another, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> out to the best aduantage, the renowne of his Princes armies, he must also take notice of the strength which his enemies attaine by confederates, how much they make with the mercenaries, and auxiliaries of others: hee should consider and conferre by iudicious reading, the warres and battels of his Princes Progenitors and Predecessors, wherefore they were leuied, how performed and fought, vpon what conditions ordered, and the meanes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing either partie to the taking or offering of those Articles, with such speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all instructions, as I partly noted before in the Leiutenant generall. When therefore he knoweth and is well instructed through what manner of ground the Armie must passe, then he presently giueth notice and warning to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronells of horse and foot, in what formes they should order their troupes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> battels, for their more present and commodious passage; narrowly respecting that euery Commander doe with diligence respect his charge, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddling further in matters beyond his office, or short of it.</p>

to be made, aduertising what time the Lord Lieutenant Generall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> purposeth to march forward into the field, that they may sutably be prepared: and the same day that his excellencie shall set forth, the Lord Marischals trumpet soundeth and giues warning of a remouall; after him all other trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets follow, that vpon the third flourish, euery captaine, souldier, and seruant may be readie to performe their offices in each degree for that seruice. The scoutmaster therefore is first set forth to dispose of his scurriers for espiall, that he may for the armies more safety certifie, whether the countrey round about be cleare: after him the master of the Ordinance setteth forward with his Artillerie furnished of all needfull instructions, for the dispatch of any thing which resteth in his charge: after them the treasurer seconded with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt master with victuall: and lastly the carriages which by directions of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> captaine or master of them take their places in marching. When these offices are thus fitted, and that the Coronels and captaines by their directions haue out of troupes ordered their armies, then the Lord Marischall seeth the footmen march; vpon which there are guides attending to direct them in the sure and readiest way, which guides the Lord Marischall seeth prouided; one to wait vpon the Lord Leiutenant, another vpon the Coronel of foot, another vpon the Coronell of horse: in like case seuerall guides for the master of the Ordinance, to point out the surest and most conuenient way for the conuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Artillerie: for the master of the carriages one, for the Sergeant maior, and for the scoutmaster attending the auaunt curriers each of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> one. This being orderly disposed, there are (by the Lord Marischals di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the captaine of the pioners) a certaine number of labourers atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Ordinance, which may mend the wayes for the better passage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. After this the Lord Marischall taketh with him certaine of his horse, and foote to view the ground where the forces should lodge or encampe. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Campemaster, the prouost Marischall, and harbinger with the foure quartermasters, when he shall come to the place, his foresight is what forrage, water, and other needements for the armies are there abouts: and (when this is seene into) the Campe-master, with the prouost marischall quarter out the ground according to the seuerall regiments, making the middle space within <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the quarters so large, that the regiments vpon a sudden allarme, may presently meet, and be set in array for the present seruice. The Marischall also noteth what number shall out of euery priuat companie walke the round, and keepe centrenell, with the places where they shall abide: he giueth watch word which the clerke of the watch doth write by his direction, deliuering to euery counsellor of the field, to the scout-master, and to euery priuate cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a note thereof: if the L. Marischall see cause, he may change the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word at his pleasure. Hee declareth his opinion to the Leiutenant vpon any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> enterprise, what number of horse and foot are competent therefore that they may be by the Coronels chosen out for the execution of any designe: the the Lord Leiutenant giuing direction who shall haue the generall charge of such seruice. All intelligence brought by the scurriers or pyoners taken in espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or neere the campe, are first brought vnto the Lord high Marischall and by

It resteth in his iudgement, to determine of all prisoners taken; which are forfeited forthwith vnto him, if they (that surprise them) do not presently present them to his Lordship, which likewise are punished at his discretion: the third part of all booties got, is his by right of that office. He likewise prouideth that the slaughters of beasts and other easements of the souldiers be not made to the annoyance of the Campe, seeing that euery souldier pay for his victuals that he taketh, looking that all such prisoners as are committed to the Marischalsie be well vsed, punishing quarrellous or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous persons, theeuish souldiers, &amp; treasons according to the lawes of armes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> in that case prouided: which are (by direction from him) faire written in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and fixed vpon the Marischalsies gate, or on some other more conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous place in the campe or quarter, so that they may be generally published. From him proceed all proclamations by voyce of Herauld with a trumpet in the Lord Leiutenants name. He seeth the watches, as captaines, rounders, centrenels, to stay their due times, vntill their drums or triumpets discharge their watches: he looketh that quietnesse and silence be kept in the campe, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on setting of the great watch after the warning peece be discharged: through him are all honourable and dishonorable actions and exploits of persons (to their immortall shame or good fame) recorded in perpetuall historie for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> he likewise (accompaned with the Coronels, Generall of horse, and foote, with the master of the Ordinance, and Sergeant maior) vieweth the ground, where most aduantage in their discreet iudgements may be found, for placing or abiding with their troupes on horse and foot, and for the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable planting of their Artillerie, with such cunning lures as may bring forward the enemies being neere to that place of aduantage. In time of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell he serueth on foot with the Sergeant maior: when the campe shall moue, his trumpet giueth the summons; by notice thereof all other trumpets soone after sound a flourish at the L.

He directeth the campe-master in his forme and order of encamping, and what number of campes should bee made in euery quarter; instructing likewise the trench-master in the maner, breadth, and depth of his trenches, for the most safetie towards battery by night or otherwise: considering what flancks or buttresses may conueniently be taken away; and (if they be flanked) where they may soonest and safest approach: what course best serueth (in case they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> cannot get entrance by plaine meanes) to distresse their flanckes, by minings, or counterminings, if the ground will serue, if not so, then by scaladoes, or stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of strange &amp; excellent deuise, with other meanes, which haue been, or may be done with most commendation, and securitie for such a purpose.</p>

Vpon any seruice he ioyneth in directions with the L. Marischall in choise of the ground: and his place of seruice is in the middest of the battell with the L. Generall. Ouer all our English battels there are Gouernors appointed which are at command vnder the Coronell generall, or his Leiutenant.

Marischals tent, the Coronell ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall on the left, with other counsellors according to their degrees &amp; places, all opening into the place of assembly; where the master of the ordinance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with all his carriages and Artillerie remaineth. Neere to this there must a place of necessitie be intrenched forthwith for preseruation of the powder, aswell from danckenesse, as from all daunger of fire. Also the prouant and carriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters with all their victuals &amp; carriages haue places there. Within the virge of the Campe, he doth appoint what ground of aduantage shall serue for planting the Ordinance, and that all carriages which shall come in, may make their repaire to the precincts for the Campes defence; the precinct or virge of the Campe, being distended seuenscore foot at least from all tents and cabbines. He seeth vpon euery remoueall that such watches as must serue for that night be first placed for their ease, making themselues ready for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and in like sort all the horse. A spacious street of seuenscore foot at the least must deuide the horse quarter from the foot, through which their horses may with ease passe to watering and forrage. A place of assembly likewise (euen as in the foot quarter) should be made there; that the troupes may with ease come forth vpon present seruice. He likewise appointeth what number of horses must attend euery foot battell according to their places, with other Gouerners euen as the foote were, sauing that the small streets in their horse quarter: must be twentie foure foot wide at the least: the Coronell generall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hauing chief place in the midst as before; &amp; his tent opening semblably to the place of assembly.

the Campe-master, as the foote captaines doe; the Campe-master himselfe is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to be lodged neere the Lord Leiutenant amongst the counsellers; besides him the quarter-masters or harbingers of the field: annext to the L. Marischall his prouost, with the prison of Marischall-sea; betwixt which and the Maris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals tent, the prouost is placed. At all assieges the Campe-master accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth the Lord Marischall to view the ground, that they may know thereby to distribute it into competent Campes &amp; quarters accordingly, with the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number of souldiers apportioned, and destined to their places in euery Campe: the greatest number enuironeth the L. Leiutenant, where the place of assembly should be so large, that (vpon allarme giuen) the whole forces may reunite in present forme of battell, being well instructed and readie: he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> likewise prouideth that euery Campe be well entrenched, sauing where the entries of euery street are, seruing for issue to &amp; fro. And so much because it is one speciall place of seruice in the field, haue I spoken at large of the Campe-master: I will be briefe in the rest for so much as they depend for the most part vpon the former.</p>
            <p>The master of the Ordinance (after his charge receiued) must be prouided of all necessaries thereunto: first vnder him in office are a Leiutenant of the Artillerie, certaine Clerks, a Master groome and his Mate, all of them in pay, with all sorts of artificers needfull, as Cannoniers for great Ordinance, serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and labourers only for the Cannon, Armorers, Sawyers, Smithes, Pistol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menders, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> &amp; of other peeces, Enginers, Cutlers, Carpenters, Collermakers Wheelewrights, Basketters, Coopers: the munition appertaining his office are Lances, Halberts, Partisanes, Billes, Dagges, Pistols, and Pistollets, Corselets with their Burganets, and Pikes, Armonish for horsemen, Lighthorsemens staues, Muskets with their rests, and Bandaleirs, Harquebusies furnished, and also for other necessaries belonging Ordinance, as Serpentine &amp; cornepowder for the Cannon, and other shot of all sorts and quantities, Scaling ladders and bridges, match and plate for ladles, platesheers, gabions for defence of the Cannoniers, okeham, and haire, hatchets, and hedgebilles, forges for smithes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with their implements, hammers, iron and steele, leade for small shot, moulds, stuffe for cartages and fireworkes, priming powder, with pinnes, rests, wormes, wyers, ramming staues, ladles, flasks, squares, rules, and other Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall instruments for planting, leuying, and leuelling of the Cannon.</p>
            <p>It is not to be thought that the Romanes could haue so boldly borne away many victories, with dayly triumph, if the deuise of Cannon and gunpowder had beene knowne vnto them: for these be grieuous and almost dastardish impediments to mens valours, which onely by violence of those ensignes are taken away before they can haue space and opportunitie, to make noble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their heroycall vertues; which example hath been and is so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and common, as that it need not be specified. The best vse of them is for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> offence, as at the batteries of townes, castels, sconces, bulwarks and such like; for they will beat downe the grossest walles, staunching the ditches, and moats vnder them with grauell and rubbish: but to bring them for battell into field (vnlesse your battels be strong and very well instructed) is thought by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
