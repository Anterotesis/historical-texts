            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE
Epiſtle to the Reader.</head>
                  <p>WE were engaged about a year ſince in a
publick Diſputation at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> upon
theſe two Queſtions, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Whether, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Commiſſion of our Lord and
Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, Adult Believers are only the proper
Subjects of Baptiſm, and not Infants? 2. Whether the
Ordinance of Baptiſm, as appointed by Chriſt, is to be
adminiſtred by dipping, plunging (or) overwhelming only,
and not otherways?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The occaſion of that Diſputation appears from the
Preliminaries ſigned on their part, by Mr.</hi> Samuel
Chandler, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Francis Williams, <hi>two Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Miniſters, in the following words,</hi> Whereas by
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s late preaching on the Ordinance of
Baptiſm, ſeveral Perſons have taken offence; and upon
deſire of ſatisfaction, it's mutually agreed between
us, whoſe Names are under-written, That theſe two
Points be amicably diſputed, <hi>&amp;c. So that Mr.</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dler<hi>'s
Sermons were the cauſe of the Offence, and their
deſire of Satisfaction the occaſion of the Diſputation:
And as for Dr.</hi> Ruſſel, <hi>he knew not of that Agreement
till afterwards, ſo that he could not poſſibly be the
Aggreſſor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Diſpute was over, the <hi>Doctor</hi> having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
occaſion (by reaſon of his Wife's Illneſs, and
other preſſing Affairs) return'd for <hi>London</hi> the next
morning; but before he could reach home, an Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was printed in the <hi>Poſt-man</hi> (ſuppoſed to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:150284:3"/>
by their importunity) giving an unfair and biaſſed
Account thereof to the World. And ſome time after
they publiſhed another Advertiſement in the <hi>Flying-Poſt,</hi>
full of Vntruths, as I have formerly told them. And
this, together with the Noiſe and Clamour they
made in the time of the Diſpute, by which the People
were hindred from hearing what was ſpoken, were the
Reaſons why it was thought meet to make it publick; of
which they had a particular account in the Dedication:
And whatever be the Conſequence, they muſt not throw it
upon us, but take it to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>As touching our Narrative, we think it may deſerve
the Title of a True Narrative; for it was publiſhed
with all faithfulneſs, as to what was there delivered,
according to the beſt account we could get either from
our own Memories, or the Copies we could procure: And
if they had been minded to have inform'd us of any thing
further, they ſhould not have refuſed us a ſight of their
Copy when deſir'd. But after all this noiſe of Omiſſions
and Alterations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they can ſay no more, nor give
any better Demonſtration of what they have ſaid than
what doth yet appear, we muſt needs tell them that our
Narrative will ſtand good, notwithſtanding all their Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
againſt it; and theirs will appear to be (not an
impartial, but) a partial Account. And this we may
further aſſure them, that as they have manag'd it, they
have been ſo far from giving us any further light or
ſatisfaction therein, that they have wholly fruſtrated the
great Expectation of divers of their Friends: For, when
they ſaw thoſe Advertiſements they publiſhed from time
to time complaining againſt our Narrative, and that
Certificate they ſent into the Weſt, wherein they boaſt of
their great Victory over us, which they ſaw was ſtuff'd
with ſuch great ſwelling words of Vanity, at the ſame
time charging our Narrative to be full of palpable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Falſhoods; and deſiring them to ſuſpend their
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:150284:3"/>
Judgments till they had a view of their Anſwer: It
made their own People to abuſe us, and reflect upon us by
their over Credulity; and filled them with an Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome great things to be diſcovered when theirs
ſhould come out into the World. But at laſt (after ſix
months time) when it came to their view, they found their
Expectations fruſtrated: For, inſtead of giving them a
more clear account, they had ſo torn and mangled it, that
it ſeems to them to be in a moſt miſhapen form, ſcarcely
intelligible: And not ſo much as one of thoſe vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
they boaſted of could be procured to teſtify to the
truth of what they had certified under their hands.
This made divers Presbyterians to own the Truth, and
ſubmit to holy Baptiſm upon Profeſſion of Faith, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
had done upon the Diſputation: For when they
ſaw there was Railing inſtead of Reaſon, and pretended:
Probabilities in the room of ſolid Arguments; and a
falſe Abſtract of Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s old patch'd up Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
taken out of other Mens Works, inſtead of thoſe
new Arguments they were in expectation of; and not
one ſingle Scripture Teſtimony either where it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
or any Example of any one Infant that was
baptized, either by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
or any other Primitive Miniſter whatſoever; it
was ſufficient to convince any conſiderate judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that they had been hitherto miſled by theſe blind
Guides, and that they had no deſign (let their pretences
be what they will) that this Goſpel-Ordinance ſhould be
reſtored to its Primitive Purity, and firſt Inſtitution,
according to the Commiſſion of our Lord and Saviour
Jeſus Chriſt, which they know to be agreeable to our
Practice, and have confeſt it ſo to be. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Chandler <hi>in the Sermon he preach'd</hi> Nov. 24.
1698. <hi>on</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. <hi>ſaith thus.</hi> I come to the
fifth thing propoſed, to ſhow the Subjects of Baptiſm,
who are qualified for the receiving of this Ordinance.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:150284:4"/>
Here we are to conſider, either who are qualified in
the ſight of God, or who in the ſight of the Church:
That is, to whom God will apply the inward Grace
ſignified in this Ordinance, and who Men may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Baptiſm, as not being able to judg of the
Heart.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore in the ſight of God, Repenting Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are to be baptized, they have an undoubted
right to this Ordinance. God hath been graciouſly
pleaſed to order it, that all thoſe that turn to him by
Faith in Chriſt, with reſolution of Subjection and
Obedience to him, ſhould be admitted to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
wherein he ſignifies and ſeals he will give them
remiſſion of Sin, adopt them into his Family, and
give them Right and Title to Heaven. Theſe were
the Subjects of Baptiſm when the Ordinance was
firſt inſtituted and appointed. Then it was neceſſary
Men ſhould repent and believe, otherwiſe they had
no right to this Ordinance. While Men remained in a
ſtate of Judaiſm or Heatheniſm, till they give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Chriſt, ſubmit to the Lord Jeſus, they had
no right to this Ordinance: Therefore you read, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and be baptized;</hi> and, <hi>If thou believeſt with all
thy heart, thou mayſt.</hi> So that if we were ſent into
an Heathen Nation, we ought to engage them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and believe before we adminiſter this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to them.</p>
                  <p>2. In reſpect of the Church, profeſt Believers are
to be baptized. God, he doth not give the inward uſe
of this Ordinance to any but thoſe that actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and believe: But the Church cannot ſee the Heart:
Where Men therefore make a ſolemn Profeſſion of
Faith and Repentance, there they are to be admitted
to this Ordinance. Where Men have a competent
underſtanding of the Principles of Chriſtian Religion,
and ſolemnly profeſs to devote themſelves to the Lord
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:150284:4"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, and contradict not this Profeſſion by
notorious Ungodlineſs, or an openly wicked Life,
theſe we ought to admit.</p>
                  <p>Would not any Man that had been a Stranger, and
heard Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> preach ſuch Doctrine, have taken
him for a Baptiſt Preacher, and not a Presbyterian? But
pray how doth he acquit himſelf from being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
condemned in himſelf? His Anſwer is this, If any
through miſtake, or neglect of the Parents, have not been
baptized, they ought to ſubmit to this Ordinance, as
thereby profeſſing they give up themſelves to God. The
ſame with what he ſaid at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> in our very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
upon the Diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> he did own that Adult
Believers were the proper Subjects of Baptiſm.
Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſaid, Then you own our Practice to be
right. Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſaid, Yes, if they have not been
baptized in their Infancy. Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> replied, You ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they are to be baptized by virtue of ſome Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that it is by the Commiſſion of our Lord and
Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> anſwer'd, Yes, I
do ſo.</p>
                  <p>By all this it appears theſe Presbyterians own that
Chriſt hath commanded Adult Believers to be baptized,
and they are the proper Subjects intended in our Lord's
Commiſſion: So that at beſt, if Infants are the Subjects
of Baptiſm, they are but improperly ſo. But (by his
Confeſſion) if Infants are not at all intended in that
Commiſſion, then thoſe that we baptize upon Profeſſion of
Faith are the only proper Subjects of Baptiſm (according
to Chriſt's Commiſſion) and Infants are not the Subjects
at all. And till he anſwers like a Logician to Dr. <hi>Ruſſel's</hi>
firſt Argument, and produces his Inſtance upon his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Negative, and ſhews us where it is written, that
Chriſt hath required any of his Miniſters to baptize
any one Infant, the Controverſy is fairly iſſued, and it's
we, and not they that have obtained the Victory; or
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:150284:5"/>
rather, that Truth is ſtrongeſt, and hath prevailed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Men are juſt like the Phariſees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in our
Saviour's time, who acknowledg'd that the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
did oblige the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to honour and relieve
their Parents in their Neceſſities: But by an Invention
of their own, by putting a falſe Gloſs upon the words, as
appears by their <hi>Talmud</hi> (treating of Vows) <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.
a Man is bound to honour his Father and Mother, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he vow the contrary. This our Lord takes notice of
in <hi>Mat. 15. 4, 5, 6. Mark</hi> 7. 10, 11, 12, 13. by the
name of <hi>Corban,</hi> a Gift. In <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations you
have theſe words: As touching this word <hi>Corban,</hi> the
moſt free and unconſtrained ſenſe ſeemeth to be this: The
Phariſees were a very covetous Generation, and had a
ſhare in the Gifts that were brought unto God for the
uſe of the Temple, or otherwiſe; thence they were very
zealous and diligent in perſwading the People to make
ſuch Oblations: And when any pretended the need that
their Parents ſtood in of their help, they told them, that
if they told their Parents it was a Gift (<hi>i. e.</hi>) that
they had vow'd ſuch a portion of their Eſtate to a ſacred
uſe, that would before God excuſe them for not relieving
their Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that they were not obliged by
that Precept to honour and relieve them any longer.
Thus he tells them that by their Traditions, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a more religious expounding the Divine Law,
they had indeed deſtroy'd it, and made it of no effect
at all.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, if you ask theſe Presbyters, Whether
Jeſus Chriſt gave Commiſſion to his Miniſters to baptize
Believers? Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſhall ſpeak for them; his words are
theſe, <hi>We muſt all confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt gave
Commiſſion to baptize Believers when at the Age of
Maturity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if this Queſtion were put to the Phariſees, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch <hi>Jews</hi> were obliged by that Command of God
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:150284:5"/>
to honour and relieve their Parents, who had ſaid to
their Father or to their Mother, <hi>Corban?</hi> Their Anſwer
was, He is free, and they ſuffered him no more to do
ought for his Father or his Mother.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, if you ask theſe Presbyters, whether
ſuch Perſons are obliged by that Command of Chriſt to
be baptized in his Name when they come to years of
Maturity and do believe, who have been baptized in
their Infancy? Their Anſwer is (as the Phariſees of
old) they are freed from that Obligation, and they will
not ſuffer them to be rightly baptized according to Chriſt's
Commiſſion: Whereas Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> confeſſes they ought
ſo to be, if they had not been baptized in their Infancy.</p>
                  <p>Now foraſmuch as there is no other Authority for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſprinkling,
but what the Phariſees had for their
<hi>Corban,</hi> i. e. the Command or Tradition of Men, why
may not we apply the words of our Saviour (to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees)
unto theſe Presbyters? Thus have ye made the
Commandment of Chriſt for holy Baptiſm of none effect
by your Tradition of Infant-ſprinkling; and thereby
render'd the Word of God of none effect: And that it's
vain Worſhip that is taught by the Precepts of Men, you
muſt be forced to acknowledg, or deny the words of our
Saviour: And if Will-worſhip, vain Worſhip, Mens-Commandments,
and Human Traditions be not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the Word of God, there is nothing forbidden;
but Men are then at liberty to do what they pleaſe in the
Worſhip of God. Why you (that are of this Opinion)
ſhould keep up a Separation from the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
unleſs it be for Humour and Intereſt, I cannot imagine.
But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe learned Annotators ſay, That altho the <hi>Jews</hi>
did for ſome tract of time keep to the Divine Law, yet
in proceſs of time they abuſed that Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 14. to
found a new Invention upon it: That beſides the Law
written in the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> God delivered to
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:150284:6"/>
him in the Mount divers things which were not written,
which he delivered only by word of mouth to the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi>
which are to them as much a Rule of Judgment
as any part of the Law which was written: By which
means they gained themſelves a liberty of making the
Law of God what they pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>From whence we alſo may obſerve, that they did not
deny this to be written that is recorded in the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
but that the other was alſo intended and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in it, which they endeavoured to perſwade the
People to believe, by their falſe Gloſſes upon the Text:
For they confeſs it was not expreſly written in the Law,
but that it might be intended, tho not expreſt: And
that it was delivered by word of mouth, tho it be no
where ſo written in all the Word of God: For they call'd
it a Tradition of the Elders.</p>
                  <p>Whether Covetouſneſs (as in the Phariſees) lies at
the root of this Practice of Infant-ſprinkling, themſelves
are the beſt Judges: But this they confeſs, That it is not
expreſly commanded in the Word of God: But they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to perſwade the People that it is intended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(altho they can't produce one Inſtance of any Infant
that was baptized) and by their corrupt Expoſition of
ſome Paſſages in holy Scripture, and their falſe Gloſſes
(like thoſe of the Phariſees) they prevail upon their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and unthinking admirers to believe it upon their
word, altho there is not one ſyllable of it recorded in the
holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>But when this will not do, they tell them it was the
Practice of the Church for many Ages, and they have
reaſon to believe that it was taught by the Apoſtles, altho
there be no mention of it in holy Scripture. For in <hi>p.</hi> 13.
of their own Account they ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> might declare
it, tho the New Teſtament ſhould not diſcover that he
did. And in <hi>p. 15. Paul</hi> might have declar'd the
Baptiſm of Infants an hundred times over, and yet it
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:150284:6"/>
might not be left on Record in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
nor any part of the New Teſtament that he did ſo.
I therefore demand of theſe Presbyters, that if they be
not of the Papiſts Opinion, that Infant-Baptiſm is an
unwritten Tradition, what moved them to uſe their very
Language? Had they not a fit opportunity to produce a
Scripture-inſtance if they had been able? But it ſeems all
the skill they have, with all their pretences to Learning, is
not ſufficient to inable them to find it out; and therefore
we muſt ſtill charge it upon them as a Scripture-leſs
Practice, and a mere Human Invention, without the
leaſt ſhew of either Precept or Example to be found for it
in all the Word of God: And conſequently we muſt reject
it as an unwritten Tradition, and Will-worſhip; and
(as ſuch) forbidden by the holy Scriptures; and that from
the Pens of the moſt learned Pedo-Baptiſts, in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of the ſecond Commandment.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing theſe Men grant this Practice of theirs is
not expreſt in the Writings of the New Teſtament, let
them tell us the reaſon of this total ſilence therein? Why
did not our Lord command it if he intended it ſhould be
practiſed? Why did not the Apoſtles ſet it down in their
Writings? What can be the reaſon why thoſe holy Men
ſhould not make ſome mention of it in the many Books
they have purpoſely written for our Inſtruction? Why did
the four Evangeliſts conceal it? The <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles
make no mention of it when they ſet down in writing ſo
many thouſands of Men and Women that were baptized?
How comes it to paſs that the Apoſtles <hi>Peter, James,
John</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> who wrote ſuch excellent Epiſtles, ſhould
not ſay one word about it? But above all, the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi> who wrote fourteen admirable Epiſtles, and ſpeaks
in them ſo often of this holy Ordinance of Baptiſm,
who profeſſes he did declare all the Counſel of God, and
kept back nothing that was profitable to be known, and
praiſes them for keeping the Ordinances as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:150284:7"/>
to them, and declares, that as he received them
of the Lord, ſo he had delivered them; does not in all
his Epiſtles make the leaſt mention of Infant-Baptiſm.
Is not this alone a great Argument againſt your
Practice? I pray conſider it: For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let
every Man prove his own Work.</hi> You aſſert it, and
therefore it lies upon you to prove it.</p>
                  <p>But to evade this, you make uſe of the ſame method
againſt us, as the Papiſts do againſt the Proteſtants, when
they demand of them to give ſome formal Paſſage in
Scripture that doth expreſly and by name deny what they
affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> where it's ſaid expreſly that there is no fire
of Purgatory, and that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the
Head of the univerſal Church, and that the Maſs is not
a Propitiatory Sacrifice. Now this method of Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is accounted in the Papiſts an unjuſt caviling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſuch unreaſonable Proof, or elſe to pretend the
Proteſtants cannot anſwer them. The <hi>Turks</hi> may as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
demand of the Papiſts, where there is to be found
any formal Paſſage in Scripture that ſaith expreſly that
<hi>Mahomet</hi> is not a true Prophet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then pretend the
Papiſts cannot anſwer them. And ſurely if it be unjuſt
caviling in their own eſteem, when demanded of them, it
muſt be the ſame in themſelves when they demand it from
the Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>Juſt ſo you Presbyters ſerve us. It belongs to you that
impoſe this Opinion of yours upon us, and oblige others to
believe it, to make the truth of it appear from holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For no one is bound to believe that which cannot
be prov'd to be true. You ſay that the Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Parents ought to be baptized; but we deny it.
It's not our buſineſs to prove our denial by ſhewing ſome
formal Paſſage in Scripture where it's ſaid <hi>in terminis</hi>
that Infants are not to be baptized; it's enough for us to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in all the holy Scripture: And till you give your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:150284:7"/>
where it is ſo written, we ſhall neither believe nor
practiſe it: For till that be done, the Controverſy betwixt
you and us is at an end: And (in my opinion) you had
better have forbore ingaging in it at firſt, ſeeing you have
ſo little skill to manage it. There was one preſent at the
Diſpute who wrote thus to his Friend in <hi>London,</hi> Sir,
<hi>We have ſeen the groſs Abuſes of the Diſpute printed
by Mr.</hi> Chandler, <hi>&amp;c. who makes Lies his Refuge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to
favour his bad Cauſe.</hi> But as a Miniſter of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> ſaid, If <hi>Chandler</hi> and the reſt had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Proof for their Separation from the Church, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to defend it, they were grand Schiſmaticks; for
they proved nothing. Another Miniſter of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> that was alſo at the Diſpute, told a friend of
mine, that he had ſeen our printed Narrative, and did
declare that it was a very good Account of the Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Alſo a Doctor of Divinity, who came to give me
a Viſit, told me that a Country Parſon of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
who heard the Diſpute, did declare to him his great
Diſſatisfaction againſt the <hi>Presbyters</hi> both for their weak
and ill management of themſelves in that Diſpute; and
did alſo declare to him that the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> were too
hard for them. And this was no mean Man among the
Clergy that gave him this account. I thought meet to put
this in print, to put a ſtop to their vain-boaſting.</p>
                  <p>As touching their Account of the Diſpute, if it had
been ſutable to their Title, the World had heard nothing
further from us about it; for we deſire no other but that
it may be truly known what paſt therein on both ſides:
And if they had not given ſuch ſevere and uncharitable
Reflections upon divers Perſons of our Perſwaſion, both
Miniſters and others, upon the dead as well as the living,
and ſo forc'd us to write in our juſt defence, they had not
received any harſh Language from us; for we do not think
that an advantage to any Cauſe: but what we have done
of that kind, we may ſay with the Apoſtle, they have
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:150284:8"/>
compell'd us to do: For we have not uſed this method out
of any prejudice againſt their Perſons, but to defend our
ſelves from their unjuſt Reflections, and to vindicate that
Truth they oppoſe, and which we believe in our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to be the Mind of God, in oppoſition to that human
Invention practiſed by them.</p>
                  <p>We have alſo took care to publiſh the Teſtimonials ſent
to us by particular Perſons, according to their direction;
leaving out ſome things we thought might too much expoſe
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinſon;</hi> for which I am ſure
we deſerve their thanks. If what is contain'd therein be
not delivered with that Accuracy as ſome may expect, let
them conſider it's not every Man's Talent ſo to do; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do matters of Fact always require it.</p>
                  <p>Whereas we have cauſed to be printed an Anſwer to
their Dialogue, written by a Friend to that Truth we
profeſs, who lives in the Country, and gave it to Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi>
when he came to <hi>London,</hi> with liberty to print it, if he
ſaw good: And altho (for ſome prudent reaſons) his Name
is not thereunto affixed, he will not be wanting to vindicate
what be hath written, when a juſt occaſion ſhall preſent.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons for its brevity are theſe. 1. Becauſe
he himſelf had but little time to prepare for it. 2. The
reaſon why I made no inlargement, was becauſe I never
ſaw their Dialogue till after Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> ſhew'd me the
Anſwer to it. 3. Our time together was very ſhort,
and we did not think fit to alter another Man's Copy.
4. Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> being Moderator, he did not think it ſo
fit for him to engage in it; and if the Author had not
been refer'd to, they ſhould have had no Anſwer from
him. As for Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> he deſired me to make an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for him with reſpect to his brevity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as I
know not of any need there is for me to do it, ſo my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
in this Epiſtle will not permit me to inlarge.</p>
                  <p>As for that new-faſhioned way of burying with a Turf
only on the Head, which thoſe Dialogue-makers ſeem to
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:150284:8"/>
be ſo pleaſed with, as I know not any that practiſe it, ſo
I ſhall leave it to themſelves as I found it, without any
Remarks upon it; not ſuppoſing the Reader will be fond of
the Invention. But any whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>fical Conceit ſerves theſe
<hi>Presbyters</hi> to imploy their Wits upon in ridiculing our
Practice of the holy Ordinance of Baptiſm, as commanded
and ſubmitted unto by the Son of God. If it be ſo
grievous in their Eyes, why do they not anſwer what their
own learned Authors have ſaid for our manner of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
before they thus reflect upon it? For, as one of their
own Miniſters hath told the World in print (ſince the
<hi>Portſmouth</hi> Diſputation) that their excuſing themſelves
from that manner of Adminiſtration we uſe (by dipping
the Perſon under Water) becauſe of the coldneſs of the
Climate, is in his opinion but a cold Plea. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their outcry againſt us, themſelves could practiſe
it upon Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> to ſerve a turn.</p>
                  <p>There are ſo many Errors in their Account, that I ſhall
not trouble my ſelf any further about them, for my leiſure
will not permit me: and there's ſo much ſaid in the Book
it ſelf to prove theirs to be what it is, <hi>i. e.</hi> a falſe and
ſcandalous Account, that I need not add any more.</p>
                  <p>As for Mr. <hi>John Williams</hi>'s Sermon upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
we were not willing the World ſhould be deprived
of it, not only becauſe he hath deſerved well of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
but becauſe they are the words of a dying Man;
and we hope the Reader will not ſee cauſe to repent of
that additional Charge he is thereby put to in the Price
of the Book; for we are perſwaded it will more than
compenſate that ſmall Charge.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude with what I did before (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their perverſe Conſtruction of it) that the great <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi>
from whom we receive all Bleſſings, would make
our Endeavours herein ſucceſsful to his Glory and the good
of Souls, that ſo there may be added to the Church daily
ſuch as ſhall be ſaved.</p>

Mr. John Sharp, Miniſter of the Goſpel,

at the Diſputation in Portſmouth.</head>
                  <p>IT may be thought ſtrange that I ſhould appear
in this nature to the World, in the matter rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to our Oppoſers Diſputation and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
with Dr. <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> it is not as tho the ſaid
<hi>Doctor</hi> had any need of my Aſſiſtance (and
therefore I intend no long Apology) but only for
theſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe it is the Cauſe of God, wherein his Truth
is eminently concerned.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe our Oppoſers have condemned our Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
in that which they allow in themſelves in their
own Narrative.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe Brother <hi>Williams</hi> is dead, who was able
to have vindicated what he then offered (tho he is
now brought in as one then rambling in his Diſcourſe.
<hi>See their</hi> Narrat. <hi>p.</hi> 59.)</p>
                  <p>4. Becauſe it is fit that the World ſhould be informed
how unfairly they dealt by us, both at the Diſpute, and
now ſince in their Narrative.</p>
                  <p>In theſe my ſhort Notes I ſhall not ſtrictly tie my
ſelf to this or that particular method, but ſhall begin
firſt to take notice of their declaring publickly, in the
Appendix to their Narrative, <hi>p.</hi> 64. that we made the
firſt Diſturbance; whereas all that were preſent may
remember how they acted towards us, making the
firſt Diſturbance themſelves: And therefore I do aſſure
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150284:10"/>
all, where-ever the Narrative may come, that it was
not as they relate it; and I am ready to think they
themſelves might forget it, by having ſo much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
upon their hands, or elſe it muſt be to make thoſe
that are at a diſtance believe how well they carried it
towards us, tho I was forc'd to reprove the People and
them too, which I ſhould not have done had they not
acted towards us in that <hi>manner</hi> as they did. I am
ready to give my Teſtimony before a Magiſtrate, if
required, that they themſelves did make the firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance.
How this might be improv'd againſt
them, I will leave themſelves and others to judg, if
it were managed by their own Pens. Let them but
remember their Deportment towards Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>
when he quoted <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and ſeriouſly reflect upon
it. Alſo I would not have Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> forget, when
he was charged afterwards with hiſſing, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it, ſaying, he did not hiſs: Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> being
preſent, ſaid to him, <hi>Sir, You did hiſs;</hi> he the ſaid
Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> anſwer'd and ſaid, <hi>It might be an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi>
making as if it was but a ſmall thing. And
tho Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> is dead, there are thoſe that were
preſent that can give evidence of this; and I my ſelf
can give it more fully, as I received it from Mr. <hi>John
Williams,</hi> if there ſhall be need. But I would beg of you,
Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> if you come to read this, that you would
not be in an heat, as you were then; for, if you are,
much Water will not quench it, if I may ſay by you
as you ſaid (<hi>Nar.</hi> p. 60.) by Mr. <hi>Leddel,</hi> you being,
as I ſuppoſe, concerned in drawing up your Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
But muſt this be your way of ridiculing the
Ordinance of Chriſt (as by us pleaded for?) I did

hands. I mention not this out of any diſreſpect to
you, but that you may be ſenſible that it is true what
is ſaid before, and that you were in the miſtake.</p>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:150284:10"/>
Our Oppoſers may alſo remember how ready
Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> was at all times to make Diſturbance,
ſaying to Dr. <hi>Ruſſel, If you know not how to form your
Argument, I will tell you:</hi> which the <hi>Doctor</hi> had no
need of, for he offered more than they did know how
by any fair and due method to evade, or than ever
they will be able to anſwer. I never perceived that
he was at a loſs at any time to form his Argument,
or to give them an Anſwer. But Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> was
ſo often in this abuſive work, that Mr. <hi>Biſſel</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Gentlemen, Ye do not fair by Dr.</hi> Ruſſel, <hi>ye ought</hi> to
give him liberty to offer his Arguments, and when
he hath done, then to make the beſt of them. And,
I ſuppoſe, it was for this piece of Service, that his
Copy was by them afterwards look'd upon to be but
as <hi>a Lawyers Breviate, containing only hints for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi>
as they ſlight it. <hi>Append. to Nar.</hi> p. 56.</p>
                  <p>Next, when they would have ſet Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and
the <hi>Doctor</hi> at a difference about their different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> replied, <hi>If I am not of his Opinion,
I am of yours, Sir,</hi> (ſpeaking to Mr. <hi>Robinſon.</hi>) Then
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid, <hi>If you ſay an hundred times as much
more as you do, you ſhall not ſet the</hi> Doctor <hi>and I to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the ears:</hi> And here they fell a laughing,
ſhewing their Rudeneſs.</p>
                  <p>Again, when Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> gave them the liberty of
the whole New Teſtament to prove Infant ſprinkling
was any part of the Counſel of God, I ſaid, <hi>They
might take it any where, from</hi> Geneſis <hi>to the</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>if they could but prove it.</hi> Hereupon Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi>
rudely ſaid, <hi>What, Sir, the New Teſtament in</hi>
Geneſis? But Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> replv'd, <hi>Yes, Sir, the New
Teſtament is in</hi> Geneſis: To which he made to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
And here I will take notice of their words,
<hi>pag. 66. So that Infants may be baptized, if we can
bring good Proof for it out of the</hi> other parts <hi>of holy</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:150284:11"/>
                     <hi>Writ.</hi> Here theſe Gentlemen forgot that there was
given them ſuch large liberty to prove their Practice
out of any part of the written Word: but, as they
did nothing then, ſo they have done nothing ſince
by their printing, <hi>to bring any good Proof for their
Infant-ſprinkling out of any part of the Old or New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and therefore I muſt conclude they cannot find
it in Holy Writ: for they have been in their Studies
before and ſince, and they knew what they were to
be engaged in; and if they had not been prepared
before the Diſpute, they ſhould have taken better care
ſince.</p>
                  <p>Alſo there was much ſaid upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. and
<hi>Luke</hi> 3. 7. between Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> and my ſelf; and if
any of their Notaries have taken it (or any thing
elſe that will ſerve their turn) let them bring it out
if they pleaſe, yet ſo as not to wrong me: For I do
deny that my Reply, which they have put down,
<hi>p.</hi> 40. was to Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> for it was to Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi>
and I never ſpake the words as they are there put
down to my wrong; it was ſo much of it that I did
then ſpeak, that I do not remember all that I ſaid to
him, but yet this I do remember of the words, <hi>That
all that appear to be a viſible Generation of Vipers ought
to be caſt out of the Church, that is to ſay, without
they repent.</hi> He did confeſs that they did ſuſpend them
for a time: And I replied, <hi>By the Rules of Chriſt ſuch
ought to be excommunicated, and they did not act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Rule, if they did not do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, when upon <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. I ſpoke, they need
not ſtand ſo long upon the former part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the <hi>9th</hi> Verſe would clear who were the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and repeated the words: Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
me, ſaying, <hi>Sir, where are you now?</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>If I have tranſgreſſed the Rule of a Moderator,
I would ask the Peoples Pardon.</hi> Thus neither I nor
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150284:11"/>
thoſe of us that were to ſpeak in the Diſpute could
ſpeak, but he was ready to interrupt us; tho all
there preſent may remember that we acted towards
them very ſoberly: but had we done otherwiſe, I
do not queſtion but you would have heard of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now.</p>
                  <p>They made an Apology of their not being willing
to have a publick Diſpute before the People; and I
having heard ſomething of that the night before,
told it to ſome of our People there: they told me
that they would have diſputed them in private, if
they would have diſcourſed it according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
When they were thus making their Apology,
I replied, that they might have had it in private, if
they would have diſcourſed it according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and that they had been offered it before we
came thither: This they could not deny, and alledged
no further; and yet they would plead their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
ſince on purpoſe to blame us.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> offered to argue it with me, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>I thought Dr.</hi> Ruſſel <hi>and Mr.</hi> Williams <hi>were
able to manage their own Arguments, and therefore there
was no need of that:</hi> Yet I have been heartily ſorry
ſince, that I did not offer then to change a plain Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with any of thoſe our Oppoſers, it being ſo fair an
opportunity to bring you to the Scripture, by which
means the People would have had more light into the
Truth. And when the Arguments on our part were
brought to bear, and were back'd by the Scriptures,
I deſired our Oppoſites to grant, or deny, or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
or give another ſenſe of the Scriptures, but
they would give none.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> was giving the aforeſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
Repreſentation to the People, I deſired he would
forbear, if not, I would oppoſe him; and yet he
went on (as he uſed to do in the Diſpute) and gave
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150284:12"/>
a further account to the People. I deſired him again
to deſiſt, and if he would not, I could not, nor would
forbear him: but, if he would give the <hi>Doctor</hi> leave
to ſpeak for himſelf, I would forbear; and ſo with
much ado <hi>I did get him to forbear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I was called upon to conclude in Prayer,
and it was ſaid it was my place, Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> would
not leave off, but as he began, ſo he did continue to
the end, and ſaid it would be but vain Repetitions if
he ſhould: I replied, I would offer no vain Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for them; I hop'd I made Conſcience of the
Duty of Prayer as much as they did elſewhere, and I
would not do it there for them.</p>
                  <p>And now I would not have them talk too much of
their <hi>Copy,</hi> and condemn others; I would have
them to remember, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was not capable
to repeat one of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Arguments when he was
call'd upon to do it, after that Mr. <hi>Liegh</hi> had denied
one part of it, and the <hi>Doctor</hi> deſired him to repeat
it, and he could not do it, which the <hi>Doctor</hi> improv'd
upon him, and ſaid, Do you not know what you
deny? And if he fail'd in the preſent, I know not
what he might do afterwards: But I do not queſtion
their Abilities to help him out. And as for Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s
Copy, they pretend in their Narrative to find a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Falſhoods, Additions, Alterations and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
in it; but nevertheleſs it is judged that
he is as good a Writer as the other; and as for
their Narrative, it will be particularly examined by
the <hi>Doctor</hi> himſelf; and how many ſuch faults he
will find there, our Oppoſers may judg themſelves,
that have gone ſo large as they have done. They
have made them ſpeak on our ſide as mean as ever
they can, and as full for their own. But I believe
that all who look into the <hi>nature</hi> of the management
of the Matter and the Arguments, will fall in with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150284:12"/>
thoſe that are moſt agreeable to the Word of God,
and are fairly drawn from thence. For, I hope, all
Perſons will conſider, that if our Oppoſers had Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
offered them by ſuch mean Men as they have
repreſented the old Gentleman to be; what would
they have done if they had had Men that had been
thorowly furniſhed for that work? The leſs they
make us, I think they make themſelves the more
mean. Could they not much eaſier have overturned
their Arguments without ſo many Reflections? Can
they think that will credit their Cauſe, or make
them look greater? Doth this agree with that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
which the <hi>Poſt-man</hi> gave of the <hi>Doctor,</hi> as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
Infant-Baptiſm with all the Subtilty and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry
of the Schools? Surely that doth not agree
with this diminutive Deſcription they now give of
him: They could know little of his Abilities in the
ſacred Languages, for they did not diſcourſe much at
that time out of any of them; and if they had, what
advantage would it have been to them to have known
one anothers Abilities in the Languages, unleſs they
could have convinc'd him by their Abilities? But tho
they profeſs to have them, neither he nor others that
wanted Conviction from them, had it by their giving
us one inſtance of Precept or Precedent for their
Practice of ſprinkling Infants, inſtead of baptizing
or dipping them when Adult Believers, that it was
either commanded or practiſed by Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:
for I my ſelf ſhould have been glad to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Conviction then or now by their Writing, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
it have any foundation in the Word of God; and
yet it ſeems they would have us believe it without
and blame us for not believing it upon their word
We could eaſily believe it, if it was as eaſy for then
to prove and maintain it, as commanded or grounde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
in the revealed Will of God, to be obſerv'd an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:150284:13"/>
practiſed by them and us. But until I receive ſuch
convincing Light and Satisfaction from them out of
the Word of God as the Rule for our Practice in this
matter, I ſhall, notwithſtanding their Abilities in
Languages, and for all what they have ſaid as yet in
the Diſpute, or written ſince in their Account of it,
continue in the ſame mind, and the ſame Practice,
when thoſe that believe do tender themſelves to be
baptized, according to the Practice of the Apoſtles.
If you, Gentlemen, that are our Oppoſites, or any of
you can ſtill convincingly prove, that your Practice
has any Precept or Precedent in the Word of God, I
will own it to be of Divine Inſtitution: In the mean
while this plain Argument for our contrary Faith ſhall
ſatisfy me.</p>
                  <p>If Infant-Baptiſm hath neither Precept nor Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the Word of God, then 'tis not of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:</p>
                  <p>But Infant-Baptiſm hath neither Precept nor Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the Word of God;</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is not of Divine Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>When you have prov'd your Practice as we have
done ours, then you will have a great many more of
your ſide; and till then, you ought to deal more
kindly and fairly by us than you have hitherto done,
eſpecially in the Diſpute, as I have partly ſhew'd: and
I muſt needs ſay, I am afraid you will not hereafter
deal ſo kindly and fairly by us as you ſhould, ſince
you charge the dead with that which is falſe, and yet
pretend <hi>to tread ſoftly over his Grave,</hi> pag. 62. for
immediately in the next words you give us Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi>'s
Miſrepreſentation againſt Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> (now
dead) there are two Witneſſes that were with him,
and they wrote it down as Mr. <hi>Farrel</hi> ſpake it: and I
my ſelf had it from the old Gentleman's own mouth in
the preſence of ſeveral Witneſſes, together with his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150284:13"/>
Arguments, and carried them to Dr. <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> and I have
ſufficient reaſon to believe it is true, and that he has
abuſed neither Mr. <hi>Francis Williams</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Farrel</hi>
in what he has ſaid of them; and all that knew him,
did know he was as able as moſt Men to retain what
he had heard, and to give an account of it, but more
eſpecially, when others with him took ſuch particular
care to put it down in Writing, that they might
not be miſtaken in any thing afterwards. I believe
that poor Story had never come into print, had old
Mr. <hi>John Williams</hi> been living.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, I would have the World judg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us (or at leaſt thoſe that are both judicious and
unprejudiced, and ſo able to judg between us and our
Oppoſites) how that <hi>pag.</hi> 66. they condemn our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
by wholeſale, ſpeaking in theſe words, <hi>All
the Arguments they offer'd were trifling Cavils.</hi> Now
I would have you, Readers, to conſider, Is not this a
very eaſy way of refuting to condemn <hi>all,</hi> when they
are not able to anſwer <hi>one</hi> of them? Ye may ſee from
hence whether it be they or we that did trifle: For
in the next foregoing <hi>Page</hi> you may ſee how they do
particularize the matter, and ſay it is falſe (tho what
of it is ſo, thoſe that are concerned in it may look to
it, as in the caſe of Brother <hi>Duke.</hi>) Now in that
Paſſage (<hi>pag.</hi> 65) this is to be minded (to obſerve
how well it does agree with what they ſay elſewhere);
they ſay in theſe words, <hi>But that none of us would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to dip a Perſon in ſuch a caſe, is true: We never
pleaded againſt dipping as one way, but as the only way;
not againſt its Lawfulneſs, but Neceſſity.</hi> And yet
preſently after they tell you, <hi>that the Anabaptiſts Cauſe
does reſt on weak unſcriptural Principles, how loudly
ſoever they pretend to Scripture.</hi> Now I muſt ſay, if
our Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>dipping Believers,</hi> be weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural,
they ought then to plead againſt it, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150284:14"/>
refuſe the doing of it, which it ſeems they do not do
by their own Confeſſion aforementioned, but on the
other hand they in plain words grant its Lawfulneſs.
Now if it be lawful, that is, conſiſtent with, and
agreeable to the Command of God and Chriſt, and
the Practice of the Apoſtles, then it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural,
nor our Principles ſo weak as they would
make them in the Eyes of thoſe who are for our
Cauſe, and own our Principles, tho theſe Men make
ſo loud, a noiſe againſt them as weak and unſcriptural.
We oppoſe the Principle and Practice of our Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts
as unſcriptural, weak, and unlawful, in ſo far
as it is neither commanded by God or Chriſt, nor
implied as ſo commanded by any ſcriptural Precedent.
But if they will evade our arguing, and ſay, as they
ſeem to do in their forecited words, That our <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
and <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>baptizing or dipping Believers is
ſcriptural indeed,</hi> but it is not the <hi>only ſcriptural way,</hi>
but there is a <hi>ſecond</hi> ſcriptural way, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>dipping
thoſe that do not believe, as Infants do not,</hi> by the
preaching of the Word; <hi>and alſo a third, of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thoſe that do believe, together with Infants that do
not believe:</hi> and that theſe other ways are intended in
the Command of Chriſt, and implied by this or that
Precedent as commanded, and conſequently are as
well ſcriptural ways, as that of dipping Believers is
(for this is the Queſtion now between us) I ſay, if
they can prove theſe other ways as diſtinct or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from ours, to be alſo ſcriptural, <hi>i. e.</hi> intended
in the Command of Chriſt, and implied by ſome
Precedent in Scripture, let them produce it if they
can do it, for they have never done it yet: If they
cannot, then theirs ſhall be their own darling Notion,
and they have no reaſon to charge ours as our dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Notion, unleſs they can prove that their bare
<hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> or <hi>ſay-ſo,</hi> is ſufficient proof againſt us that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150284:14"/>
deny it. And indeed we need do no more than to
deny this their <hi>darling</hi> and unſcriptural Practice and
<hi>Notion,</hi> till they are able to prove it: Becauſe he that
will not only affirm, but alſo convince another of
his Principle and Practice as commanded in Scripture,
ought in all reaſon to prove it to be ſo, 'ere he can
blame another that denies it, that he hugs a darling
Notion in his Boſom. Set the caſe ſome Papiſts ſhould
blame theſe Gentlemen that are our <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> for
diſowning the Baptiſm of Bells as being unſcriptural,
would it not be ſufficient for them to ſay, that it is
no where commanded in Scripture by any expreſs
Command, or any Practice that implies ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?
And if the other ſhould demand a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Command to the contrary, or elſe they would
continue to blame them as hugging a darling Notion,
a weak and unſcriptural Principle, would our <hi>Oppoſites</hi>
not think this very unreaſonable and weak? Well
then, I do not queſtion their Ability in making the
Application in our caſe: For, if it be good in them,
it's ſo in us.</p>
                  <p>Further, how do theſe their <hi>Reflections</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
and the <hi>Introduction</hi> to their Narrative
agree together? For in the beginning of that <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi>
(which I ſuppoſe was penn'd by Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>)
are theſe words, <hi>Muſt I again be call'd out to engage
in this irkſome and unpleaſing Controverſy? who had
much rather ſpend my time in healing Differences, and
provoking all Chriſtians to love one another;</hi> and then
follow ſome Expreſſions of Arch-biſhop <hi>Tillotſon.</hi>
But O! had he or they taken Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> for their
Pattern, to write after his Copy indeed, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
we ſhould have been more fairly and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
treated by them, or by this Prefacer in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
than we are. For, we have a Paſſage cited by
the <hi>Doctor,</hi> p. 59. where that great Man Dr. <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:150284:15"/>
does ſay, <hi>Antiently thoſe who were baptized put
off their Garments.</hi> Now this ſaying is ſo far from
ridiculing us or our Practice uncharitably, that it
makes for us; for he does not ſay they expoſed their
Modeſty by putting off their Garments; nor does he
there trifle as they do about the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> p. 81. And
whereas in the ſaid Introduction there follows theſe
words, <hi>I had much rather be dreſſing my own Soul for
Eternity, and preparing others for thoſe calm and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Regions, where perfect Charity and Good-will reign
for ever, than in fomenting and increaſing thoſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
among Chriſtians which are too unmeaſurably wide
already;</hi> I do wiſh with all my heart all of them had
put this deſire in execution: I for my part would not
have hinder'd them, nor do I know any that would
that are concerned on our ſide in this Controverſy,
wherein our Antagoniſts have not only not preſſed after
that <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Good-will</hi> the <hi>Introduction</hi> ſpeaks of,
but alſo (I think) have laid a foundation for a greater
Diviſion, unleſs God by his Power and Providence
over-rule our Spirits on both ſides: For they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
us and the Truth wherein we differ from them,
as very ridiculous and trifling: However, the Truth
which we believe we cannot part with, we are to
buy the Truth and ſell it not; and inſtead of making
us to part with it, they have rather given us more
ground to believe it to be Truth.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> p. 2. begins the Abridgment of his
Sermons thus, <hi>Here I muſt unavoidably dip my Pen in
the watry Controverſy: I love not to meddle with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Diſpute.</hi> It is a ſign he does not (if I may
ſay ſo) or elſe he had not lov'd to meddle with the
matter of the Controverſy which Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had with
Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> about <hi>ſinging;</hi> I ſuppoſe neither was at his
Sermons, and what ſhould make him bring their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
in thither, I do not well ſee, unleſs he loved
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150284:15"/>
to defame Dr. <hi>Ruſſel.</hi> He ſays indeed there, <hi>p.</hi> 12.
that he mentions it <hi>to convince Mr.</hi> Webber <hi>and his
Adherents, what a doughty Champion they have choſen
for themſelves.</hi> But you may ſee thereby the <hi>Charity</hi>
and <hi>Good-will</hi> he has towards us and Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> in
ſpecial, notwithſtanding his pretence that he aim'd at
ſome Conviction, tho he might very well know that
this expoſing Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> behind his back ſo publickly
about the point of <hi>ſinging,</hi> and drolling upon him as a
Hackny Diſputant, at a time when it did become
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> to be more ſolid and ſerious, would
ſignify nothing at all for any Conviction in the Point
of Baptiſm. If Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had been out in that Point,
it will not follow he is in this. However, if Mr.
<hi>Chandler</hi> had not only mentioned Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in that Point, but alſo had taken off the ſtrength
of his Arguments, Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> perhaps would have had
reaſon to have given him Thanks for it. To ſlight
them as Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> does there, <hi>p.</hi> 13. by ſaying,
<hi>Theſe were the Arguments for want of better he trifled
with at</hi> Portſmouth, was not to anſwer them: For,
tho Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſays in the Page before, that
Dr. <hi>R. advances the very ſame Arguments againſt the
Practice of ſinging Pſalms, which he does againſt theirs for
Infant-Baptiſm;</hi> yet he may know in his Conſcience
there were more, and they were all in my opinion
ſo good againſt his Practice of Infant-ſprinkling, that
he was not able to anſwer them as he ſhould, nor any
of the other that were preſent to help him. But by
reaſon I have told him ſo before, I needed not to
have told it him now again, but that there was ſome
occaſion for it; and I might have added, that I think
he and his Helpers had rather need to cry to others,
<hi>Come and help us</hi> (as in that <hi>12th</hi> Page he has the
like words) for the help he has had already, does
him little Service to overthrow our Cauſe, and to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150284:16"/>
convince Mr. <hi>Webber, and his
Adherents</hi> (as he calls them)
out of it<note n="*" place="margin">But I hope Mr. <hi>Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> is not to be taken off from the Truth he hath owned by their ridiculing the <hi>Doctor</hi> and his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor to continue in that wherein he hath not ſufficient warrant to bear him out in the Word of God. I hope Mr. <hi>Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> is not ſo eaſy a Man as to be thus prevailed upon by him.</note>. But if others are
called to aſſiſt him, it may do
him perhaps more Service, to
wit, to moderate him, and
make him write more fairly
and handſomly of his miſtaken
Brethren, as he counts us. I
wiſh he had kept to that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and then we had not
had all that Railery, Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Trifling that was and
is uſed by him. Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi>
who was it that trifled with <hi>incompleat Diſciples,</hi> you
or we? Who gave Mr. <hi>Ridge</hi>'s matter a full account,
you or we? I know, and am ſatisfied, that the <hi>Doctor</hi>
has given a true account of it, and in his own words,
as near as words can be ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>I heard a Gentleman ſay that Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> was a
Fool, and deſerved to be knocked about the Ears;
he ought to have accepted the Argument, and given
his Inſtance, which himſelf would have done if he had
been there.</p>
                  <p>Whatever M., <hi>Chandler</hi> may ſuppoſe, I am ſure
his refuſing to give an Inſtance upon an univerſal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
(when ſo often preſt to do it) neither made
for his own Credit, nor yet for the Credit of his
Cauſe: For, it made others conclude he could not do
it, and that if he could, he would have condeſcended
to have done it in ſo publick an Aſſembly, if he had
been furniſhed with any to have given. But the plain
truth is, as he could not <hi>then</hi> give us ſo much as <hi>one</hi>
ſingle Inſtance for his Practice, ſo he hath not been
able to do it ſince: for if he could, we ſhould have
had it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:150284:16"/>
For, in a Point of that moment it is a ſhame for
him now to excuſe it with this or that Nicety in
Diſputation, which (whatever he may think) rather
ſhews, that he aims at and ſtrives more for maſtery
in controverting, than that he himſelf doth heartily
believe his own Practice to be ſcriptural; for, if he
had ſo done, he would have condeſcended to any
method to clear up that which he preaches for Truth,
and pretends to have ſuch a hearty deſire to convince
us of.</p>
                  <p>There was another ſaid, he did not underſtand
what was an incompleat Diſciple of Chriſt; and yet
he is one that underſtands an Argument (in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
as well as Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> tho he did not <hi>then</hi>
walk with us, nor the other neither. His incompleat
Diſciples are ſuch as the Scripture never taught him
to call ſo; and (I think) Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> is groſly
miſtaken to ſuppoſe he has by this trifling Diſtinction
ſalv'd the Credit of his abſurd way of vindicating his
Practice, and thereby evaded the ſtrength of our
Arguments: For, they that are ſerious and judicious
Chriſtians can eaſily diſcern it to be a fallacious and
evaſive ſhift, to caſt a Veil over the Minds of thoſe
that are ignorant of this Controverſy, and do not
allow themſelves the liberty to examine it: For it is
wholly unſcriptural, and groundleſs, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
as it is applied by him in the Caſe under Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>But further: What a ſtir do theſe Men make about
the word <hi>equivocable:</hi> If there were two Letters ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at the Preſs, or (to ſuppoſe the worſt) that it
were wrong ſpelt, it had been the Corrector's place
to have mended it. It was very much there had not
been more than <hi>one</hi> Error in <hi>miſpelling</hi> in the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s
Narrative; for it's too common a fault in printing.
And it is to be obſerv'd, that there is no <hi>Errata</hi> made
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150284:17"/>
to the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s, there being few or no faults in it.
But they were forced to make an <hi>Errata</hi> at the end
of their own Book, which (by their own Confeſſion)
hath more Errors in it than they have noted, which
they excuſe by ſaying, they can create no difficulty
to an intelligent Reader: And they alſo tell us of
ſeveral Letters dropt out in working, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which if
any complain of, they may charge it partly on the
different Inclination of the Corrector, and partly on
the difficulty of bringing our common Printers to any
Exactneſs.</p>
                  <p>If by a Corrector of a different Inclination they
mean a Baptiſt, the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſaith he doth not believe
it; for (if he be not miſinformed) he is a Man of
their Perſwaſion in the Point in Controverſy: But
this he is certain of, that the Gentleman who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
his Copy when at the Preſs, is a zealous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and (to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg)
a Contender for Infant-Baptiſm; and yet he
muſt give him this Character, that he was very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Truſt repoſed in him. But an overſight
may be by the beſt of Men: But he is under a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
about it where to charge it, becauſe the
written Copy was never returned. But it is ſo inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
a Trifle to what (they confeſs) is in their own,
that it's not worth contending about: And certainly
it deſerved no ſuch ridiculous and baſe deſcanting on
it, as to call it a word of the famous <hi>Doctor</hi>'s own
coining, with other Expreſſions which they in their
Spleen have vented againſt him. Is this their Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Good-will towards us? Surely, a little Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
would have ſerv'd to have excuſed ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a fault; eſpecially, when they only gueſs that he
was chargeable with it; not knowing but it might be
an Error of the Preſs, ſeeing there were ſo many in
their own which they boldly charge upon the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
and Printer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:150284:17"/>
But they have not yet done with it; for they ſay,
if he intend equivocal Expreſſions, they are his own
peculiar Talent: Perhaps few Jeſuits herein equal or
exceed him at that ſort of Weapon. I cannot but
wonder (Gentlemen) that you ſhould thus proceed
in this manner, what can it be that thus moves you
to ſpeak againſt the <hi>Doctor?</hi> Doth this agree with
that Charity you ſpeak of (to thoſe you call miſtaken
Brethren) in the beginning of your Book? Can you
think that he deſerved that Character from you
(when you call to mind with what coolneſs of Spirit,
and evenneſs of Temper he behaved himſelf, during
the whole time of the Diſputation) I appeal to your
own Conſciences whether you think he deſerved ſuch
an uncharitable Inſinuation and ſevere Reflection?
Doth this alſo agree with Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s ſhort Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
<hi>p.</hi> 2. that God would grant that Truth may
prevail? Surely, this doth not ſhew you had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
it ſhould prevail upon the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and upon us,
either then or ſince; for your Practice contradicts
your Expreſſions hitherto. I know not what you may
do for time to come: But if you go on as you have
begun, I fear you may give the Government occaſion
to repent of allowing the liberty you ſpeak of: At
leaſt you may have cauſe to repent of allowing your
ſelves ſuch a liberty as ye do againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Who was it that trifled about the Mother of our
Lord being a Believer, you or we? And who fairly
improved it to the World, you or we? What reaſon
had Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> to allow the Eunuch to be a Chriſtian,
and conſider him as ſuch, altho (as he faith) he was
but a Proſelyte of the Gate? And yet in <hi>p.</hi> 31. to
deny (in his ſenſe) the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and repreſent her a Jew, diſtinct from that of a
Chriſtian, and that Chriſtianity in that ſenſe had then
no being. There were many Believers in Chriſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150284:18"/>
throughout the ſeveral Ages of the World, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Jewiſh Oeconomy, as well under it, witneſs
<hi>Enoch</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> from <hi>Adam,</hi> who propheſied of him,
<hi>Jude</hi> 14, 15. And were not <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
with all the reſt mentioned in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. with many
others, true Believers in Chriſt? This you know is
not to be denied. And are not all true Believers in
Chriſt real Chriſtians? And ſhall the Mother of our
Lord be denied this Appellation? when the holy
Scripture calls her a Believer in Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. from
<hi>v.</hi> 30, to <hi>v.</hi> 35. where it is thus written, <hi>And bleſſed
is ſhe that hath believed:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Leigh then</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
it.</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer therefore Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> gave to your
Demand was good and proper, altho you thus trifle
with it ſince, and change the word from what was
then ſpoken: For, by what hath been ſaid you may
ſee that if it had been the word Chriſtian, as it was
not, yet if ſhe was a Believer, then a Chriſtian; for
all true Believers in Chriſt, whether Jews or Gentiles,
are Diſciples; and you know the Diſciples were called
Chriſtians. And altho that Name was firſt given at
<hi>Antioch,</hi> yet they had the thing before the Name
was brought into uſe, and impoſed upon them.</p>
                  <p>And altho they then offered, upon giving you ſuch
an inſtance, to give us the Cauſe: Yet I do not think
they were willing either then or now to give it us,
for they have no mind to part with their Practice;
for, if they had, they would not have uſed ſuch
poor ſhifts as they have done to ſupport it. And
amongſt other Artifices they have made uſe of, this
was one, to ſend a Certificate (before their Book
was printed) down to <hi>Froome</hi> by the hands of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Smithwick</hi> and <hi>Hugh Wats;</hi> and I doubt not but
the Men are ſo honeſt, that they would not bring
ſuch a thing, if it had not been given them ſo to do:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150284:18"/>
And the World ſhall have it in the ſame words as I
had it delivered to me in my own Houſe.</p>

Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> will not be angry for ſpending our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon their Narrative, themſelves giving us that
liberty, as (I ſuppoſe) is implied by this Certificate:
For, altho it was ſent to their own Friends, yet it
being directed to all whom it may concern, I have
reaſon to think it concerns me. But I am ſure it did
concern them to make it appear that the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
was ſuch as they have repreſented it to be,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150284:19"/>
which I am certain they have not yet done. Had they
procured thoſe vaſt numbers both of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> and Diſſenters, and alſo ſome Anabaptiſts
(as they are pleaſed to call us, tho they know we
diſown both the Name and the Thing thereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied)
that would have acknowledged under their
hands, that our Antagoniſts had obtained an intire
Victory; and if upon examination they had been
found to be Perſons of Credit and Reputation, ſuch
as they promiſe by their Certificate, then they would
have gained more by that, than they have done by all
thoſe undue Reflections they have caſt upon us: For,
ſuch a courſe of Procedure ſerves rather to convince
the ſober and judicious, that they have taken this
method to blaſt our Reputation, becauſe they knew
not how otherwiſe to evade the force of our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt them, nor to juſtify their own Practice
of Infant-ſprinkling: for that had been their proper
buſineſs, if they could have done it.</p>
                  <p>They ſay in their Certificate, the Governor and
Mayor have <hi>promiſed</hi> their <hi>Teſtimonials.</hi> The Mayor's
we have not, nor yet the Governor's, to any thing
more than what relates to that firſt Advertiſment that
was put into the <hi>Poſt-man;</hi> and I expected they would
have done as they promiſed. Gentlemen, will you
thus adventure to charge the Governor and Mayor
with Promiſe-breaking? I think that to be worſe than
to give his Honour a diminutive Title (as you phraſe
it) And to give the Mayor a Title that is thought
(by ſome) to be above him. That will not repair the
damage he may ſuſtain in being repreſented by you
as a Promiſe-breaker. But I think he is more a
Man than to do ſuch a thing as that, notwithſtanding
what you ſay in your Certificate.</p>
                  <p>As touching Colonel <hi>Gibſon</hi> I do, and ſhall thank
his Honour for ſtaying till the Diſpute was ended;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150284:19"/>
and alſo thoſe Gentlemen that perſwaded him to it,
if that which is ſaid be true, that they told him, if
he went off there was danger leſt the provoked Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
ſhould do Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſome miſchief: But this
(like other things) depends upon their bare Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and how much Credit may from thence be given
to it, we muſt leave to the Reader to conſider. For
my own part, I have ſo much Charity for the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>
People there preſent, that I cannot think,
by any thing I could obſerve, that they had the leaſt
inclination to do the <hi>Doctor</hi> any Miſchief. And as for
our own People, I am ſure they had no cauſe for it,
if we take the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Argument as it is in it ſelf, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s perverſe Miſconſtruction
and Miſrepreſentation of it. But as the <hi>Doctor</hi> did,
ſo (we hope) we alſo know better things than what
Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> hath abuſively put upon the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s
words: For we can and do make a difference between
the nature of our Children, and that of Pigs and Dogs.
But it is their buſineſs, and Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
to make a difference between what God can do
in an extraordinary manner by his immediat opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon Infants; and what can be done for, and
upon them mediately, by the Miniſtry of Men,
and that before they have the uſe and exerciſe of
Reaſon: For they know his Argument was this,</p>
                  <p>If Infants are capable to be made Diſciples of
Chriſt by the Miniſtry of Men, without the uſe of
Reaſon; then the Beaſts of the Field are alſo capable.</p>
                  <p>But the Beaſts of the Field are not capable:</p>
                  <p>Therefore Infants are not capable.</p>
                  <p>Now, as I may appeal to the judgment of all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
judicious and unprejudiced Chriſtians about this
Argument, without ſuppoſing that any of them will
put ſuch a Conſtruction upon it as Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> hath
done, that it carries with it a full Compariſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150284:20"/>
exception, betwixt the Human Nature of Infants,
and the beaſtly Nature of Brutes; when they do but
conſider that it was uſed by way of Retortion only:
So I may alſo appeal to the Conſciences of Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi>
and his Aſſiſtants, whether they could poſſibly
imagine from hence, that the honeſt intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Argument was ſuch as they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it to be, in <hi>pag.</hi> 75. of their Book: As having
thereby ſet our Infants upon a level with Brutes, and
that there is no difference between our Children and
our Dogs; and this to be his fixed Opinion, as they
expreſs it: And this after he had declared himſelf ſo
fully to the contrary in his printed Narrative. For,
altho they might pretend to have forgot what he ſaid
about it in the Diſpute; or, their Paſſion might have
hinder'd their Underſtandings from being imployed as
they ought in their attendance upon it; yet when
they had it before them in print, wherein he hath
vindicated himſelf from ſuch a Miſconſtruction, I
cannot ſee but they muſt needs know his true intent
and meaning therein.</p>
                  <p>And, for my part, I believe all that read this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and conſider what the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath ſaid about
Infants, will be of my mind: Eſpecially if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid concerning Infants, That
they had a Right and Title to Glory by the free
Grace of God, and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. And
let me add but one thing, that they are made meet
for it by the work of the Spirit, which (to us) is
altogether ſecret. But it never came into our Hearts
to imagine any ſuch Priviledges to be intended as a
Donation for the Beaſts of the Field.</p>
                  <p>And if after all this, theſe Men ſhall ſtill perſiſt in
it, and charge either the <hi>Doctor</hi> (or any of us) as
they do him in their Narrative, that it is our fixed
opinion, that there is no diſparity, no difference, no
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150284:20"/>
unlikeneſs at all between our Infants and the Beaſts
of the Fields, notwithſtanding all that hath been
ſaid by us to the contrary, how can we help it? But
this I deſire the Reader to obſerve, that in <hi>pag.</hi> 76.
where theſe words are, there are alſo words which
they cite out of his Apology, that will teſtify in their
Conſciences that he allowed a diſparity: And that the
Parity implied in his Argument was only in a certain
reſpect, as hath been already mentioned. But what
may not Uncharitableneſs and Ill-will do, when ſuch
Men are reſolved to pervert the words of him they
contend with? And altho you talk never ſo highly of
your Charity in the beginning of your Book, yet
your Words and Actions to the contrary make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be no other than an empty ſound. For, a
ſmall meaſure of true Chriſtian Charity would have
enabled you to diſcern that groſs Uncharitableneſs
and Ill-will againſt the <hi>Doctor,</hi> which you have ſo
often diſcovered in your Reflections on his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>What miſchief therefore it ſhould be ſuppoſed the
Multitude ſhould do the <hi>Doctor</hi> (as you intimate,
<hi>pag.</hi> 75, 76.) I know not; nor yet from whom it
ſhould come, unleſs from your own Party: For the
reſt of the People were very civil to us, they made
no diſturbance at our going off, nor any attempts
when we were in the Street; altho all the thanks they
have from you is, to call them the provok'd Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
Whereas, if it had been true, the blame muſt
have lain upon Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> who did uſe his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to provoke them; but as it was altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe on our part, ſo it proved to be without
ſucceſs with reſpect to the People, who departed in a
quiet and peaceable manner.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> hath leſs reaſon to be of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fended
with us than with you: for, we deny nothi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:150284:21"/>
to their Children, that we allow our ſelves to do for
our own. If their Children are ſick, we pray for
them, if deſired, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is you that put an affront
upon thoſe of that Communion by your Practice:
For, whereas you ſay you baptize the Children of
Believers, conſider'd as ſuch; and yet ſome of your
Party have made ſome ſcruple of baptizing thoſe
whoſe Parents are not Members with you (as I have
been inform'd) Do you think that all Parents in the
Church of <hi>England</hi> are Unbelievers? And altho you
profeſs to have a large latitude, it may be more than
others of your Brethren; yet you do not often bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
their Children, which gives ſome ſeeming inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
as if you made ſuch a diſtinction betwixt
your Children and theirs.</p>
                  <p>For our parts, we look upon our Children to have
no more from us by Generation, than the Children
of others have from them. And I dare not ſay (as
you intimate in your Book) that the Line of Election
runs to the Believers Seed. For, I know many that
have been converted, and yet their Parents (to all
viſible appearance) were unconverted. Nay, the
Children have been inſtrumental in the hand of God,
for the good of their Parents: And (on the contrary)
ſome Godly Parents have had very Ungodly Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to the great grief and ſorrow of their Souls.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, if there was any cauſe for the
Multitude (as you call them) to be offended, it is
moſt likely to be at what you ſaid (and not what the
<hi>Doctor</hi> then ſaid) that you ſhould look upon them
as Unbelievers; for ſo you do by your Practice and
Writing, tho other things are pretended by you.</p>
                  <p>I would not have any think I am againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Election, I hope I own it as a Truth: And
when your Children and mine come to be regenerated,
it is a ſure Character they were elected. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150284:21"/>
you talk of the Parents Faith being imputed to
their Children; I muſt tell you plainly, I have heard
of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt being imputed, but
never that the Faith of the Parent was imputed to the
Children before. It may be you will ſay, you do
but ſuppoſe it; or, why may it not be ſo? It's the
ſame method indeed that Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> takes in his
Sermons: But in my judgment, it is a way to make
Men turn Atheiſts and Deiſts, and to ridicule all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Religion, to make the holy Scriptures a noſe
of Wax, to ſerve your turns. I beg of you for time
to come, to leave off ſuch ways and methods, and
to argue upon a firm and more certain Foundation.</p>
                  <p>But you proceed further in your Certificate, and
ſay you will give a full Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Book.</p>
                  <p>If you had perform'd your Promiſe herein (as you
have not) I do believe I ſhould have been of your
mind.</p>
                  <p>Neither have you been ſo good as your word in
giving us the Atteſtations of the principal Gentlemen
then preſent at your intire Victory, unleſs by them
you mean Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Mr. <hi>Maultbey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Will.
Wallen,</hi> whom you produce as Witneſſes in your
Book: And if ſo, how can theſe be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Gentlemen preſent? And if they are, where be
the Atteſtations under their hands, that you obtained
an intire Victory at the Diſpute? Or, is there any
elſe hath done it? We find no ſuch in your Book.
I would have you that are ſo rigid in charging
Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Narrative as falſe, by reaſon of ſome Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
(as you ſay) in it; (whereas he was not willing,
if he could have done it, to trouble the World with
all thoſe paſſionate Expreſſions that paſt from Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon,</hi>
or others, that were of little concern to the
World, leſt he ſhould have made it ſwell into too great
a Volume; even as I my ſelf think it not convenient
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150284:22"/>
to make this my Writing ſwell with the ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
that might be made on many other Paſſages
of your Book, leſt it be made too chargeable for the
Purſes of our poor People.) I would, I ſav, have
you and others conſider whether the ſame Objection
doth not fall as heavy upon your ſelves, ſeeing you
have not performed your Promiſe under your hands,
but have omitted to give us thoſe Teſtimonials: But
I ſuppoſe you were not able to obtain ſuch a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
from thoſe Gentlemen, or elſe we ſhould have
had it in your Book.</p>
                  <p>But there is one thing I would remark, which
is this, That in <hi>p.</hi> 70. of your Narrative, you uſe
this Expreſſion, <hi>That falſe Lie.</hi> Now altho I do
not allow your Charge to be true, yet ſuppoſe it had,
could not you, by all your Learning and Skill, have
found out an Expreſſion leſs liable to exception? Pray,
Sirs, when did you ever read or hear of a true Lie,
that you tell the World this is a falſe Lie? Are there
any Lies that are not falſe? Now I think this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
as much notice as that of the addition of a
Letter, and much more. And yet how ſtrangely did
you improve that againſt the <hi>Doctor:</hi> But I ſhall not
deal ſo by you.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Reader, I hope I have made it appear how
our Antagoniſts have no reaſon to boaſt ſo boldly as
they have done of a Victory at the Diſpute. But
whereas on the other hand, they charge it as an egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<hi>Falſhood</hi> on Dr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> p. 64. as if he had <hi>boldly
publiſhed amongſt and by his Friends in</hi> London (<hi>tho
not in his Narrative</hi>) that <hi>he, to put it out of doubt,
and his Friends had carried the day at</hi> Portſmouth,
<hi>added, the Biſhop of</hi> Salisbury <hi>had received a Letter
from Colonel</hi> GIBSON, <hi>wherein he applauded our
Performance.</hi> Now for the undeceiving of the World
I think good further to add, that I charged the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150284:22"/>
                     <hi>Doctor</hi> with this Report (for which his ſaid Enemies
call him in the place aforecited, <hi>a Falſifier of Reports</hi>)
but he told me he never ſaid ſo, nor thought ſo, and
therefore it muſt reſt upon the Aſſerter, till he can
bring forth his Evidence that the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſaid ſo, and
that it was from thence that ſuch a Report has ſpread
abroad. However, this may ſerve as another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of their Spleen and Virulency againſt him,
and how eager they are to ſnatch at any thing
to aſperſe him, and to render him little, yea to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade
him in the higheſt manner. And hence it is that
they cannot forbear to trifle with his being a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duate,
as in the laſt quoted Page: Wherefore for the
ſatisfaction of ſome Perſons that may have read their
Reflections on him and his Degree, I ſhall here add
the Certificate following, together with ſome other
Certificates that I have lately procured, or have been

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150284:23"/>
                     <hi>and</hi> Oxford, Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1695. diligently and
carefully collected out of the Regiſters of both thoſe
Univerſities; beginning at 1659. and ending with 1694
incluſive: With the Names of thoſe that were created
Doctors in Phyſick during that time (which is 35
years) placed both in an Annual and Alphabetical
Order. In both which I find Dr. <hi>William Ruſſel</hi>'s
Name inſerted in its due place and order.</p>
                  <p>From whence it is evident that Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> is in the
right, and themſelves in the wrong: And alſo it
ſerves to diſcover another miſtake of theirs, which
they (through their ignorance) charge upon him, <hi>viz.</hi>
for ſaying the <hi>Senate</hi> at <hi>Cambridg,</hi> which they call a
word of his own coining, and do greatly ridicule him
for it; whereas it appears by his own <hi>Diploma,</hi> that

                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, the <hi>Doctor</hi> doth aſſure me that the King's
Letter was thus directed: To our Truſty and Well-beloved,
the Vice-Chancellor of our Univerſity of
<hi>Cambridg,</hi> to be communicated to the <hi>Senate</hi> there.</p>
                  <p>So that it appears to me it is the common Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given to them (as that of Convocation elſe-where)
altho theſe Men are ſo ignorant as not to know it, or
ſo malicious againſt the <hi>Doctor,</hi> as not to allow it him.
It therefore gives cauſe of doubting, whether either of
them ever ſaw (in a true and proper ſenſe) the inſide
of any Univerſity in their Lives.</p>

Grace, Mercy and Peace be multiplied, through our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>THeſe Lines come from your Brother in the
Faith of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Thomas Bowes,</hi> and
are to inform you of the horrid Falſities
that are inſerted in Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s pretended Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
which he would fain have the World believe is
impartial, tho indeed it is no ſuch thing: which I hope
will evidently appear to all Men who are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced,
eſpecially when the falſeneſs of what he hath
writ concerning me and others is made manifeſt.</p>
                        <p>For if he will adventure ſo groſly to belie his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who can diſprove him, and have oppoſed him
to his face; no wonder if he belie the Diſpute it ſelf,
and the Diſputants, rather than hazard his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
which ſeemeth to lie at ſtake.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall now give you an account of thoſe things
in particular concerning me, which may be found in
his Book, that are moſt notoriouſly falſe. And take
them as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In his Introduction near the latter end, he is bold
to aſſert, That I and my Party did ſuſpend from our
Communion one <hi>Iſaac Harman</hi> a Joyner, for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mr. <hi>Webber,</hi> which is horridly falſe: For there
was never any ſuch-thing acted by me and my Party
in this World towards that young Man, nor any
other Perſon, for going to hear Mr. <hi>Webber.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:150284:24"/>
This Man hath but little regard to Truth it ſelf,
that he can boldly charge this notorious Falſhood
upon me and my Party, without being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
his Author for it, when it was required of him.
He hath indeed confidently aſſerted, that the young
Man told him ſo himſelf. But the truth of this is like
ſome of the reſt of his impartial Narrative.</p>
                        <p>For the young Man went himſelf, with one of our
Friends with him, to the Meeting where Mr. <hi>Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
had been preaching, and there charged him with
the falſneſs of what he had written, to his face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many of his Hearers; and did then offer to
atteſt upon Oath, that he never had one word of
Diſcourſe with him in all his life time, neither about
that nor any thing elſe.</p>
                        <p>And Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> did conſeſs before thoſe then
preſent, that he could not ſay he had.</p>
                        <p>Yet ſo unchriſtian-like was their Carriage to him,
that at his firſt appearance Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Miniſter, bawl'd out, and ſaid, Where is this
Man that fears neither God nor Devil?</p>
                        <p>To whom the young Man replied, that he had a
Soul to be ſaved as well as Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and did fear
God as well as himſelf.</p>
                        <p>But that well qualified Man Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> did in
his fury lay hands on him in ſuch ſort, that his own
Hearers cry'd out, Pray Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> do not ſtrike
him.</p>
                        <p>But alas! this great flood of Heat was ſoon turn'd
into the cold ebb of Diſſimulation, when they ſaw
that way of ſtirring made them ſtink.</p>
                        <p>For the next Evening Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſent one of his
Hearers to <hi>Iſaac Harman,</hi> and deſired him that he
would come to his Houſe, and have ſome talk with
him in a moderate way; and did acknowledg he
was ſorry that he ſhould carry himſelf in ſuch a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150284:24"/>
paſſionate way to him the night before.</p>
                        <p>To this the young Man complied, and went to his
Houſe, where Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> treated him with many
hollow Compliments. Now it was, Mr. <hi>Harman:</hi>
But the night before he cried out, that he neither
feared God nor Devil.</p>
                        <p>But when he ſaw he could not obtain his end by
Flattery, he told the young Man he would have him
put into the <hi>Poſt-Boy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I wonder Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſhould be ſo forward
to ride Poſt, ſince the baſeneſs of his Horſe, and his
own Infirmities have ſo often brought him to the
ground.</p>
                        <p>But again, in his Introduction he is pleaſed to
charge me with no leſs than four more as great Lies
as is poſſible for any Man to pen. For,</p>
                        <p>1. He aſſerteth, that I applied my ſelf to Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>
for a ſight of thoſe Sermons which he had writ;
which is utterly falſe.</p>
                        <p>2. He is bold to ſay that I read them, which is a
horrid Falſhood; for I never read them in all my
life time.</p>
                        <p>3. He ſaith, I having read them, ſpake words to
this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That if we ſuffer Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> thus
to go on, it will prejudice our Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>But this is as falſe as any of the reſt: For I never
ſpake thoſe words to Mr. <hi>Ring,</hi> no, nor to that effect;
which Mr. <hi>Ring</hi> muſt witneſs, if he be not biaſs'd,
and will but ſpeak the Truth: But if he will not, they
that were with me at that time will juſtify that
I ſpake no ſuch words, nor to that effect. And it is
as falſe that Mr. <hi>Ring</hi> replied, Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> takes but
the ſame liberty in his own Congregation that we do
in ours; for he never replied ſo to me. But (perhaps)
Mr. <hi>Ring</hi> will give him leave to bely him and the
Truth it ſelf, rather than by oppoſing him hazard
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:150284:25"/>
his own Intereſt, and the loſs of a Place at his
Lecture. But I ſhall not give him leave ſo to bely
me, tho indeed he hath the Confidence to take it.</p>
                        <p>4. And laſtly; (tho indeed theſe are not all the
Lies he is guilty of concerning me; yet, I hope,
it will be the laſt time he will venture ſo groſly to
abuſe me, and ſo greatly to ſin againſt God)
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> doth alſo tell the World, that I was
a Man diſſatisfied, and went over to <hi>Goſport</hi> to
Mr. <hi>Webber,</hi> which is a notorious Lie; for I never
went to Mr. <hi>Webber,</hi> nor ever ſent to him about the
Diſputation firſt nor laſt: Yet this Man would
have the World believe that what he hath written is
Truth, and ſo deceive himſelf and them too (in the
end) that hearken to him: For nothing can be more
falſe concerning me, than what he hath writ for
Truth; and therefore I ſhall charge thoſe Lies upon
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> as ſome of his own inventing, till he
doth produce his Authors, which (I believe) is as
hard to bring forth, as the young Man that told him
he was ſuſpended, and asked his Advice about it; for
as yet he is inviſible.</p>
                        <p>And I cannot imagine where he will find Authors
for ſuch Forgeries, unleſs he beſpeak them. For I can
atteſt upon Oath that all thoſe things are utterly falſe
and groundleſs, and therefore ought not to be called
Miſtakes unleſs there had been ſomething in them.</p>
                        <p>Again, he is alſo pleaſed to ſay, that if I could
believe the Doctrine of Original Sin, as they believe
it, I ſhould think Infants had need of Baptiſm: And,
that I wonder'd that the People at <hi>Goſport</hi> ſhould be
againſt it.</p>
                        <p>Now whatever I did ſay, I can ſafely declare that I
never ſpake what Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> hath written: And ſo
I told him to his face, and did offer to make my Oath
of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:150284:25"/>
For if I had ſaid what they have written, I ſhould
have wronged my own Conſcience, in ſaying that
which I did not then believe, nor do yet believe;
but I am ſure that he hath wronged himſelf and me
alſo, in ſaying and writing that which I did not, nor
could not ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>But alas! any thing that does but drop from the
Gooſe-quill of this Man (tho it be never ſo falſe) is
good enough to pleaſe thoſe that follow him; with
whom I leave him till the Judgment Day of the
great God, where he and I muſt give account of all
things.</p>
                        <p>But if he in the mean time hath any thing to object,
I am his Neighbour, and ſhall be ready to make good
what I have charged upon him, by more than a ſingle
Teſtimony. Witneſs my hand,</p>

                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>HAving received your Letter, I can do no other
than reply for my ſelf. I was willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
that prophetick Remonſtrance of being
charged to be a Man of Heat without Light. And
ſhould I at firſt ſight have declared my thoughts of
their Proceedings, I might (perhaps) have written
paſſionately, conſidering how they have endeavoured
to cloud that which (through Providence) hath ſo
many Evidences to the contrary. I believe Truth will
have its time to be made apparent.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not ſay much as to what paſt in the Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but rather endeavour to acquit my ſelf from
Forgery, which I am charged with, eſpecially with
relation to what Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> hath ſaid in his Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
or Teſtimonial, which he hath inſerted in the
<hi>60th</hi> Page of Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi>'s
impartial Account (as they call it) of the
<hi>Portſmouth</hi> Diſputation. Blame me not for putting
him laſt who ſhould have been firſt, becauſe not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in the Preliminaries, and Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> comes
in by chance. But as to what Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> hath there
declared to the World, ſome of it was then ſaid, but
not in that form, nor at all to that purpoſe, except
that Clauſe wherein he now lets the World know he
had an imperfect Account.</p>
                        <p>For having accidentally met with Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> at his
own Habitation, he was pleaſed to thank me for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150284:26"/>
his Name in print, which I then took as an Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Speech. I then diſcovered to him the place
where the words were ſpoken, but could not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remember the day of the Month; whereupon he
concluded, that if I did, he had forgotten it; but I
hope his forgetfulneſs is not Argument ſufficient to
prove I did not. And this I can ſay, that altho there
was but one time that I ſo directly deſired the ſight
of his Copy to compare it with that I had, yet both
before and after I deſired the ſight of his; and at
that time I told him the reaſon thereof, which he
alſo in his Certificate or Teſtimonial denies: Yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
he hath forgotten the other times wherein I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to let me ſee his Copy, or ſee it when it was
done, this does not prove it a Lie, or that he was never
ſpoken to about it: For if it had been ſo, what cauſe
was there for that needleſs Excuſe of Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi>
that it not being tranſcribed was not fit to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
becauſe I might take advantage therefrom; and
that ſuch things ought not to be communicated to an
Enemy? As if it could not be compared with the
Copy that I had, nor to ſuch a Perſon whom they
knew was adverſe, and would improve what was there
related to their advantage.</p>
                        <p>I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs I did not tell him it
would be printed; but I then told him, I knew not but
it would be printed, tho I was not then poſitive my
ſelf. Now if Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> would but recollect his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
he might call to mind that I ſpoke oftner to
him than that time in his Shop. It's true, that about
two or three days after the Diſputation I was willing
(for Peace ſake) the whole ſhould have been buried.</p>
                        <p>But to return to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> I cannot but wonder
what ſhould protect him in giving the World that
account of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> looſe and ſhuffling way
of arguing, which gave ſuch Interruption to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150284:27"/>
taking of what paſt in the Diſpute.</p>
                        <p>I cannot but retort this upon him; the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>
(ſo called) might have had as civil Treament among
Heathens.</p>
                        <p>But that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſhould inſinuate that he retorted
this to me, and received no Anſwer, it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
I was not ſo hot a Man as their learned Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
have reported me to be. But I cannot find fault
if I have no Light: And ſince they have all the Light,
there can be none left for me. Their Opponents are
alſo accounted by them Blockheads and Dunces, as they
then gave out, and have upon occaſion ſtill aſſerted.
I am not willing to bring Names into queſtion, only
I can't but reflect upon thoſe great Trophies of Art,
and profound Academics, which were the great Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of that unſcriptural, not to ſay antiſcriptural
Notion of Infant-Baptiſm: altho I might, ſeeing their
elevated Profundity hath not ſo much as taught them
good Manners; calling (at leaſt) their fellow-Creatures,
if not their Equals in all good Science,
Fools, Blockheads, Liars, and Sophiſters. How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous
theſe Titles are, tho they had been never
ſuch learned Academicks, may appear to thoſe who
have but only common ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>They ſeem agreed to carry on their contracted
Conſpiracy, tho it be againſt the Declaration of
Heaven. But further, Pray, worthy Sir, muſt your
Forgetfulneſs be charged as my Lie? Why may not
you be under a miſtake in this, as well as you are in
that Clauſe of your Certificate, where you pretend
the Imperfection of the Account was occaſioned by
the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> looſe and ſhuffling way of arguing.
For don't you know, when brought to the Teſt,
your Party could not be kept within bounds? Nay,
hath it not been defended by the Paſtor you ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
(Mr. <hi>John Earl</hi> by name) that we deſerv'd no
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150284:27"/>
better Treatment at your hands; and yet ſay we oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
the obſtruction of an intelligible Account to
the World? Pray, Sir, the next time you get one
to abet your Cauſe, be ſo kind as to inſtruct him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in what you would have him ſay. For <hi>W. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
to atteſt he was preſent when I came to you, and
yet not know any more what paſſed then, is ſtrange;
or, if he did, why was he no fuller in his Relation?</p>
                        <p>As to what he ſays that relates to the time of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
your Copy, as it's little to the purpoſe, ſo
it looks as if he had been your minute Companion,
and had known I had never ſpoken to you but once.
And notwithſtanding his Atteſtation, I remember that
you told me, that tho it were not done, yet you had
begun it, and ſhould make an end of tranſcribing it
in a little time; yet never was ſo kind to let me ſee
it, till it was calculated to your own Meridian.</p>
                        <p>But among other things, I wonder you ſhould be
ſo unhappy, as to diſcover your own weakneſs to the
World, in upbraiding others of Fallaciouſneſs, and
yet could not keep your ſelf clear. For to pretend
you had compared this with Mr. <hi>Maltby</hi>'s and your
own, which you call Originals, and that you found it
exactly agreable thereto; and that the one ſhould not
ſtoop lower, nor the other be raiſed higher; I can't
but fear you have conſpired together in a Lie: And
have not only endeavour'd to inſinuate it to be a Truth
among your own Friends, but alſo to the Univerſe;
for it ſeems to me no leſs than a Miracle. But what
ſhall I ſay, when Men care not what they ſay, nor
whereof they affirm; ſince 'tis well known that
Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> knows little of the Greek, if any, and leſs
of the Hebrew, whatever Mr. <hi>Maltby</hi> does: and that
your Copy ſhould ſo exactly agree to a tittle both
with Mr. <hi>Maltby</hi>'s, and what is printed, I muſt leave
the World to judg.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="54" facs="tcp:150284:28"/>
But ſince nothing can be taken for granted but what
we have Time, and Place, and Witneſs to: It will
teach me for the future to take a Witneſs when I ſhall
have occaſion to treat with Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> or any other
of them upon ſuch occaſions. For as to the proof of
this, it depends upon my Yea, and his Nay; I not
thinking in the leaſt this would have been ſo material,
as to have given them ſuch an occaſion to ground their
Cauſe upon, which was ſo lamely defended. This
ſeems to be but like a Man that is in danger of being
drowned, who will catch at a Feather, which when
caught can give him no ſupport. Upon what I have
remark'd, there is reaſon enough undoubtedly to
ſhew, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Certificate (by which he
would convince the World) is fallacious.</p>
                        <p>And as to what Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> ſpeak about this matter, neither the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
Teſtimonial, nor yet what is in the ſecond ſide
of Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Dedication, ſaith any ſuch thing; but
ſaith, tho it was deſired, could not be obtained. And
I <hi>William Leddell</hi> do here atteſt that it was compared
with another Copy, whoſe it was is yet unknown to
me to this day, but was acknowledged by Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> as
before: And that acknowledgment does not want Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Mr. <hi>James Goodeve</hi> being preſent at the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a Letter ſent to Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> by Mr. <hi>Walter Addis.</hi>
Now what occaſion there ſhould be for a Concealment,
tho in the Character it was written, beſides the reaſon
alledg'd by Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> I know not.</p>
                        <p>Sir, I think it not meet to animadvert upon all
their Reflections and opprobrious Speeches with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to my ſelf, I not being academically learned;
but I deſire to learn more of Chriſt, and to concern
my ſelf leſs with thoſe Perſons who are in a Sphere
too high for me, that count themſelves great, and all
others Shrubs, becauſe they have not attained to a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150284:28"/>
like Stature in human Literature. And let this paſs
as my Reply to what they have ſaid in reference to
me, not being in ſo great a Heat but a little Water
may cool it, provided it be not foul.</p>

                  <p>But, Sir, ſince I thought I had done, caſting my
Eye upon the third Page of Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
I ſaw as abſurd a Paſſage under my Name
as any paſſed in the whole Book, contrary to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that I gave him my ſelf touching <hi>Matthew
Caffin:</hi> Altho then Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s buſineſs was (as
he pretended) to know the Truth, that he might not
err in what he was going about, with reference to
<hi>Matthew Caffin</hi>'s lying under ſuch a Report of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Humanity and Divinity of Chriſt. But I
having no Light, and Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> having ſuch Eyes
as to ſee where none is; he is, for ought I perceive,
creating Light out of Darkneſs. For he ſaith, <hi>that I
and ſome others, Men of Heat without Light, were
very urgent to accept of</hi> Matthew Caffin <hi>for their
Champion.</hi> For I give this as my Teſtimony, That
I my ſelf ever refuſed <hi>Matthew Caffin</hi> to have any
hand in it.</p>
                  <p>But what Spirit actuates Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> I know not,
that he ſhould not care what he ſaith.</p>
                  <p>And when I ſee ſo many Untruths couch'd in one
Paragraph of his Introduction, it's a plain Indication
of thoſe many that follow, for there they are crowded
in heaps. But if Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> had told me who were
my Companions, we might then have gon to <hi>Iſaac
Harman,</hi> whom he recites (tho falſly) to have led us
to him, to have borrowed ſome Light from him, as
he (falſly) ſays <hi>Iſaac Harman</hi> did. Now, Sir, pray
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150284:29"/>
be ſo kind to your ſelf, as to conceal your Paths
(for they are dark ones) and let not blind Men tread
on your Heels. I hope you will be more careful for
the future, and not let Men with no Light (tho as
yet you have found but one of them) ſee into the
very Crannies of your wilful and woful Miſtakes.</p>
                  <p>As to the truth of my refuſing <hi>Matthew Caffin,</hi> I
could bring many Witneſſes: And I never knew but
one Perſon who was for him, which Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>
hath happily miſt, and is never like to know for me.
This is all at preſent from your Brother in Chriſt,</p>

                              <p>1. In <hi>Pag.</hi> 57. they ſay that I mention'd <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
the Great as a Scripture Inſtance.</p>
                              <p>I anſwer; This they know to be falſe: For at the
ſame time I refer'd them to the Hiſtory of the firſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150284:29"/>
five hundred years, and alledged it only to prove
matter of Fact from the Teſtimony of the Fathers;
which Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> accordingly underſtood, or elſe what
made him give this Anſwer, What do you tell us
of the Fathers? we are not bound to abide by their
Teſtimony. See <hi>p.</hi> 35. of my True Narrative.</p>
                              <p>2. In <hi>Pag.</hi> 61. they ſay, it's falſe that Mr. <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dler</hi>'s
Sermons were the occaſion of the Diſpute, and
much more that this is agreed to by them.</p>
                              <p>To this I anſwer: I have no more to do than to
confute them by their own Pens.</p>
                              <p>My words are theſe. it is agreed on both ſides
that Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Sermons were the occaſion of that
Offence taken by you (ſpeaking to Mr. <hi>Bowes,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Webber,</hi> and the Churches to whom they belong)
and of the Diſpute it ſelf, as appears by the Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now that this is true, appears from their own Pens.
For in the Title Page of their own Account they have
theſe words: <hi>An Abridgment of thoſe Diſcourſes that
were the innocent occaſion of that Diſputation.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And in <hi>Pag. 2. An Abridgment of thoſe Sermons
that were the innocent occaſion of the Diſputation.</hi>
Now in both theſe places they confeſs what I ſay to

without ſo much as telling them whether it were
an innocent or nocent occaſion.</p>
                              <p>But, 2. I can prove it under the hands of Mr. <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dler</hi>

refer you to the Preliminaries themſelves, which were

Meeting-houſe at the time of the Diſpute,
which they ſigned with their own hands, and have it

                  <p>And ſtrange it is, that theſe Men ſhould have the

                  <p>3. In the ſame <hi>page</hi> 61. they ſay it's falſe that

But,</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Webber,</hi> Paſtor of the Church at <hi>Goſport,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150284:30"/>
enough could teſtify that; for he being mounted

                  <p>3. They confeſs that Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> did give the Lie.</p>
                  <p>Now I did not accuſe him, but Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> only;
and (I hope) Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s confeſſing that he gave the
Lie, doth not prove that Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> did not: But
it doth prove that they were a couple of ill-bred, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
Presbyters, to ſay no worſe of them.</p>
                  <p>4. I muſt now charge them with a notorious Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
which they have printed againſt me, in theſe
words.</p>
                  <p>This bold Gentleman hath publiſhed amongſt and
by his Friends in <hi>London;</hi> Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to put it out of
doubt, that he and his Friends had carried the day at
<hi>Portſmouth,</hi> added, the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> had
received a Letter from Colonel <hi>Gibſon,</hi> wherein he
applauded their, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> Performance.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. That I never heard of any Letter at all ſent to
that Biſhop by Colonel <hi>Gibſon,</hi> till I read it in their
printed Account.</p>
                  <p>2. I never ſaid ſo to any Perſon whatſoever: and
I challenge them to produce their Evidence, for till
then it muſt be charged upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p>3. I neither knew nor thought that Colonel <hi>Gibſon</hi>
had been ſuch a Zealot for their Cauſe, to trouble
himſelf to ſend Letters to two Biſhops (as they ſay
he did) in favour of them, till I read it in their
printed Account; whereas, had he not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
biaſs'd, he might have known better than to
have ſent up ſuch an Advertiſment as they ſay he did
to put into the <hi>Poſt-man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> confeſſes that he was the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
who waited on the Biſhop to tell him this falſe
and malicious Story.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:150284:31"/>
And whereas he ſaith, that his Lordſhip generouſly
allowed them to make uſe of his Name for the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the World in this matter: And whereas it
plainly appears it was to deceive the World, I hope
his Lordſhip will for the future have a care how he
gives Credit to one that hath thus impoſed upon him
in ſuch a confident manner, with ſuch a notorious
invented Story of his own making; and by that
means give occaſion to have his Name printed, in
their falſe and ſcandalous Account.</p>
                  <p>4. This may well give his Lordſhip (and all others)
a juſt occaſion to ſuſpect the Narrative they have
publiſhed; for if they can allow themſelves ſuch a
liberty to print ſuch notorious Falſhoods as theſe are
about matter of Fact, what reaſon is there to believe
them in any thing they ſay? And if Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>
will but be ſo juſt, as to preſent his Lordſhip with
my True Narrative; upon comparing both together
with our Vindication, I doubt not but he will have
other ſentiments of that Diſputation, and be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
convinc'd of their Partiality and Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>5. They charge me for abuſing Mr. <hi>Goſnold</hi> in
theſe words: 'Tis as ridiculous as to abuſe his dear
Friend, and prefix falſe Greek as a Title to his Book;
when at leaſt in that Edition we have ſeen, there is
only a plain Engliſh Title, <hi>Of the Doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. 'Tis they that abuſe me: For the very firſt words
in his Title are, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in that Edition pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
by himſelf. If others that reprinted it ſince
his death have left it out, 'tis their fault, not mine.</p>
                  <p>2. It's true and proper Greek, as they themſelves
confeſs, unleſs the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> wrote falſe Greek;
for they ſay the Letters are the ſame <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. ſo
that they muſt not charge Mr. <hi>Goſnold</hi> with it, but
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150284:31"/>
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> Are not theſe bold Men, to charge
<hi>Paul</hi> with writing falſe Greek?</p>
                  <p>3. Their Pretence is falſe: For that learned Man
Mr. <hi>John Goſnold</hi> did know how to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Nominative and Genitive Caſe, and ſo do I.
But they muſt throw this Reflection upon our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the Bible, and upon <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, or rather
take it to themſelves as a falſe Accuſation, to whom it
properly belongs.</p>
                  <p>4. Mr. <hi>Goſnold</hi> doth not treat of the Baptiſm of
Water alone, but of all the three Baptiſms ſpoken of
in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Water, (which is a real
Baptiſm) and that of the Spirit, and alſo that of
Affliction, as metaphorical Baptiſms. And as the
Greek is true, ſo the Title of his Book is the moſt
proper that could be thought of, <hi>The Doctrine of
Baptiſms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. As to that for which this Charge is brought, they
pretend they gave the Anſwer there recited in the time
of the Diſpute; whereas they know 'tis an invented
Anſwer of their own, made on purpoſe to ſham off the
matter to which it relates. But that is a ſmall thing
with them, for they have done ſo throughout their
pretended Account of the Diſputation; wherein they
have moſt egregiouſly abuſed the World.</p>
                  <p>6. In <hi>pag.</hi> 75. they let us know their Memories are
ſhort with reſpect to what I ſet down in <hi>pag.</hi> 35. of my
Narrative, where I ſay, I do not remember that there
is any account in Hiſtory, during the firſt five hundred
years, that any one of the Fathers, or eminent Biſhops
of the Church, that were born of Chriſtian Parents,
were baptized until they were about twenty or thirty
years of Age: And if any of you know the contrary,
I deſire you would ſhew it.</p>
                  <p>Upon which Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> anſwered, <hi>What do you
tell us of the Fathers? We are not bound to abide by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150284:32"/>
their Teſtimony.</hi> And notwithſtanding I then made a
full Reply thereto, yet theſe Men tell the World,
they do not remember that it was mentioned in the
Diſputation.</p>
                  <p>But the thing they could not remember was, to
find out an Inſtance to the contrary: for that they
have not given us, neither then nor ſince, which they
would certainly have done if they had known how.</p>
                  <p>But they pretend to remember that which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaid nor thought by me, <hi>viz.</hi> That for the firſt
ſix hundred years Infants were admitted to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the Lord's-Supper. And this I muſt charge
upon them as utterly falſe, and an Invention of their
own.</p>
                  <p>But it is true, that from <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time for the ſpace
of five or ſix hundred years the Supper was given to
Infants; and both that and Baptiſm contended for as
neceſſary to Salvation: For which <hi>Auſtin</hi> had that
Name given him of <hi>Pater durus Infantium.</hi> And this
is ſo well known to the Learned, that theſe Men will
but diſcover their Ignorance in denying it.</p>
                  <p>7. They have wholly altered the ſtate of the Caſe,
as to what Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſaid upon <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 33. For
whereas he aſſerted that the word in the Septuagint
Tranſlation was <hi>baptizo;</hi> I denied it, and told him
it was <hi>ebaphe:</hi> But that if it had been as he ſaid,
it was nothing to his purpoſe, becauſe it was not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
written in Greek.</p>
                  <p>Upon which he ſaid, <hi>Baptizo</hi> comes from <hi>Tabal.</hi> I
asked him then, how it was in the Hebrew in that
place? He anſwered it was <hi>Tabal:</hi> which I denied.</p>
                  <p>And after I had ſeen the place, I told him it was
not there. See <hi>p.</hi> 54. of my Narrative. And at laſt
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> confeſt it was not. And they all allow
it in Print.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs in their own account, <hi>p.</hi> 82. they ſay,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150284:32"/>
that to try my Skill in the Hebrew, who had ſo
ſhamefully faulter'd in the Greek, I was asked what
the Hebrew word was, and that I ſaid, if I had an
Hebrew Bible I could tell.</p>
                  <p>Now this I muſt charge upon them as an Invention
of their own: And his Friend Mr. <hi>Ring</hi> can teſtify
that I had made my Obſervations upon that place in
<hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 33. and ſent them to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> in a Letter,
and received an Anſwer from him before I came down
to the Diſpute; and had examined the place upon the
occaſion of a Paſſage upon it in Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
upon the word <hi>Tabal,</hi> and therefore knew what
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſaid was falſe before I came from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi>
So that I did not ſtand in need of a Hebrew
Bible to examine that in the time of the Diſpute.
But I have cauſe to ſuſpect that Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> had
not examined it himſelf, but made uſe of ſome other,
who did not rightly inform him: for altho it be in
<hi>v.</hi> 33. in the Engliſh Bible, it is not ſo in the Hebrew,
but in <hi>v.</hi> 30. And altho I knew it, I was no more
obliged to teach him that, than I was to inſtruct him
in the difference between the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi>
words in the Book of <hi>Daniel.</hi> But it was my buſineſs
to force him to acknowledg before all the People,
that what he ſaid was falſe; which accordingly he
did, and hath ſince done in Print.</p>
                  <p>And as for that ſilly Sarcaſm of theirs, that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Bibles are all miſplaced with him; for we hear
from good hands (they ſhould have ſaid from lying
hands) that at <hi>Havering</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he was confounded
with the ſame place, and could not find the Prophecy
of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt, I had but one Diſpute at <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and
that was in the pariſh-Church at <hi>Avely,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Yaylor;</hi> and there was no mention made
of this place in <hi>Daniel,</hi> either by them or me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:150284:33"/>
2. There was no Hebrew Bible produced, nor was
there any occaſion for it: So that I muſt return this
Story to the Father of Lies, from whence it came.</p>
                  <p>And that the World may ſee that what I ſay is
true, I ſhall inſert the following Certificate, written

were preſent at that Diſpute; which was obtained by

                  <byline>
                     <hi>By Dr.</hi> WILLIAM R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SSEL.</byline>
                  <p>THey dedicate their ſcandalous Pamphlet to the
Honourable Major General <hi>Earl,</hi> Governor;
Colonel <hi>John Gibſon,</hi> Lieutenant-Governor of
his Majeſty's Gariſon of <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful

                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Mayor of <hi>Portſmouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> Theſe Men quarrel with me for calling Colonel
<hi>Gibſon</hi> Deputy-Governor, when themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
that Major-General <hi>Earl</hi> is Governor. Is not
Deputy-Governor as honourable a Title as Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</p>
                  <p>If they think I ſpeak too diminutively of him, can
they ſuppoſe they have mended the matter in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
to yoke their Worſhipful <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                     <hi>Henry Seager,</hi>
who drives that common Trade of a Baker in the
Town of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> with ſuch honourable Perſons
as the other two? Is this all the Reſpect and Honour
they can afford to give them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> They ſay, We humbly lay theſe Papers at
your feet. Surely they have reaſon to trample upon
them in diſdain, when they find themſelves intituled
to ſuch a falſe and ſcandalous Pamphlet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> They ſay, who procured for us a Grant from
his Majeſty, publickly to vindicate the common Cauſe
of the Reformed Churches.</p>
                  <p>1. Infant-ſprinkling is the thing you muſt intend.
How then came you to decline the Vindication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and refuſe to give ſo much as one ſingle inſtance
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150284:34"/>
for your Practice, altho you were often call'd upon
to do it (in the time of the Diſputation) both by
Mr. <hi>John Williams</hi> and my ſelf?</p>
                  <p>2. How comes Infant-ſprinkling to be appropriated
(by you) to the Reformed Churches? Surely there are
others in the World practiſe that, beſides thoſe of
the Reformed Churches.</p>
                  <p>Are you ſo ignorant, as not to know that all the
Papiſts in <hi>France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Poland,
Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf (the Seat of the Whore of
<hi>Babylon</hi>) do practiſe Infant-ſprinkling as well as you?
How then have you the confidence to tell theſe Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Perſons, and the whole World, it is the common
Cauſe of the Reformed Churches? whereas it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
known, that it is the common Cauſe both of
Papiſts and thoſe you call Reformed.</p>
                  <p>3. If it be appropriated peculiarly to either, it
muſt be to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for you know that
the Reformed Churches did receive it from her, and
have retain'd it as one of her Relicks to this day.
For they have no Scripture Authority for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly.</hi> They ſay it tends very much to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of early Piety and Religion.</p>
                  <p>1. If they believe themſelves, why were they guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſo great a Sin of Omiſſion, as not to vindicate
their Practice when they were ſo often preſt to it,
and yet could not be prevailed upon to give any
Scripture Inſtance for it: And would not ſo much as
try their Skill (when ſo fair an opportunity was put
into their hands) to prove their own Practice, and
thereby ſettle thoſe that are wavering among them;
notwithſtanding they pretend it was the thing for
which thoſe Honourable Perſons procured for them a
Grant from his Majeſty?</p>
                  <p>But, 2. How the ſprinkling a little Water upon the
infants Faces, and calling that Baptiſm, ſhould be to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150284:34"/>
them an occaſion of early Piety and Religion, is
ſooner ſaid than proved.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me rather to have a contrary tendency,
eſpecially your telling them when they come to years
of underſtanding, that by their Baptiſm they are put
into a new Covenant-relation, that you have dedicated
them to God, that they are in a ſtate of Salvation;
that thoſe who neglect it, have no more reaſon to
hope for the Salvation of their Infants than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;
but they muſt only leave them to the unfathoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
depths of God's Goodneſs, having no Promiſe to
rely upon, <hi>p.</hi> 11. That they are ſolemnly admitted by
Baptiſm into the Viſible Church; (how this agrees
with Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Argument from <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. he would
do well to conſider) that they are the more ſpecial
Objects of the Promiſes of Grace; that the Vein of
Election frequently runs in the Channel of believing
Parents, and their Seed; and that if they die during
their Infant-ſtate, they ſhall be ſaved, <hi>pag.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Add to this what is ſaid in their Preface, that the
Covenant of Grace does fix the Terms upon which
Chriſt will be a Saviour to any; that thence <hi>only</hi> it
is to be known whom he will ſave, and whom he will
not.</p>
                  <p>Now unleſs theſe Men will deny the Doctrine of
final Perſeverance (as held by the Calviniſts) they do
rather give thoſe Children an occaſion from hence to
neglect the moſt important Duties of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>For, why ſhould they repent and be baptized in
the Name of Jeſus Chriſt for the remiſſion of their
Sins, if they are baptized already, and their Sins all
pardoned, and this Pardon ſealed to them by ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a little Water on their faces?</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould they believe in Chriſt, that through
him they might have an Intereſt in eternal Life and
Glory, if it be ſecured to them already another way?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:150284:35"/>
Why ſhould they work out their own Salvation
with fear and trembling, if it be ſecured and ſealed to
them already, by what you call Baptiſm, without any
poſſibility of miſcarrying? For they ſay, that if ſuch
die in their Infancy, they ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Now, Do they not hereby do all that in them lies
to perſwade ſuch Perſons, that if they had died in
their Infant-ſtate, they ſhould have been ſaved by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Covenant of Grace, and in the Line of
Election? And can they (after all this) ſin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
out again, and become Reprobates? I thought
you Presbyters had been of another mind. Can you
put them (whilſt Infants) into the Covenant of
Grace, and turn them out again (when they come to
be Adult) as you think fit? I cannot imagine you do
believe your ſelves when you thus write; nor can you
ever think to gain us to your Party by ſuch Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences
as theſe: For we know that the Decrees of
God are immutable, and it is not in the power of any
Creature to alter them. And we alſo know, that you
cannot (from your own Principles) be at any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
who are elected, and who are not (whilſt in an
Infant-ſtate) till ſuch time as they come to be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
called. And ſeeing you do not believe that all
Infants dying in their Infant-ſtate ſhall be ſaved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you tell us, that you leave ſuch as die unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
to the unfathomable depths of God's Goodneſs,
there being no Promiſe to rely upon: I muſt now
needs diſcern the cloven Foot, notwithſtanding your
ſham pretences to cover it: For unleſs you did think
that the ſprinkling of Infants is neceſſary to Salvation
(notwithſtanding thoſe deceitful Expreſſions in your
Preface) or (at leaſt) did doubt within your ſelves,
whether any unbaptized Infant could be ſaved, all
this you talk of is but inſignificant trifling. And you
had better deal plainly with the World (as one of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150284:35"/>
your Brethren did) to let them know, that if he muſt
baptize no Infants but what he knew to be of the
number of the Elect, he muſt not baptize any; for
he did not know what Infants were in the Covenant
of Grace, and in the Line of Election, and what were
not: For, I believe you know as little of the matter
as he, altho you ſeem ſo unwilling to confeſs it. But
if you neither baptize them, as knowing them to be
the Elect of God, nor yet in the Covenant of Grace,
how can you ſay they are in a ſtate of Salvation, and
that if they die in their Infancy they ſhall be ſaved;
except you did conclude (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> did) that the
Baptiſm of Infants is neceſſary to Salvation, and that
they are actually brought into the Line of Election
thereby, and made the Children of God, and Heirs
of Glory? And if ſo, then free your ſelves from the
Papiſts <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> if you know how. Is this the
way to early Piety? Surely no.</p>
                  <p>For if they were not ſprinkled in their Infancy, and
afterwards told by you (or others) that it was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Baptiſm (altho in truth it is no Baptiſm at all)
they might then be eaſily prevailed upon to ſubmit to
the Baptiſm of Chriſt. And when they are taught
that Repentance from dead Works, and Faith towards
God were to precede Baptiſm, and to fit them for it:
And that Baptiſm is an initiating Ordinance, without
which they cannot be true Members of the viſible
Church of Chriſt: And that they muſt be dead to
Sin, before they were buried with Chriſt by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm:
And that after they were baptized, they muſt
walk in newneſs of Life. This were a more probable
way to incline them to that great Duty of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
their Creator in the days of their youth; and
to promote and advance early Piety and true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in their Hearts and Lives.</p>
                  <p>But ſo long as you ſhall tell them that they are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150284:36"/>
made Diſciples of Chriſt as ſoon as they are born;
that they were made Chriſtians, Members of the
Church, and enter'd into the new Covenant by what
you did for them when you ſprinkled them with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
This hath a direct tendency to lull them aſleep
in ſecurity, and make them draw this falſe Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that they were thereby made Chriſtians indeed,
and ſo deceive their own Souls.</p>
                  <p>For, it is found by woful Experience, that many
of them who are poor, ignorant, impenitent, and
wretched Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ers; yet they will be exceeding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
if you do but queſtion their being (really and
indeed) Chriſtians. What (ſay they) were not we
baptized in our Infancy, and thereby made Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Members of Chriſt, Children of God, and Heirs
of the Kingdom; and do you queſtion our Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
Now if you will but ſeriouſly conſider how far
you have been the unhappy Inſtruments of the ruin
of theſe poor Creatures, by hardning them againſt
the Truth, as it is in Jeſus; and making them (like
the Phariſees and Lawyers of old) reject the Counſel
of God againſt themſelves by that deception you have
put upon their Underſtandings, you would certainly
diſcern that you have made work for Repentance,
and cannot acquit your ſelves therefrom, until you do
renounce that ſcriptureleſs Practice of Infant-ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and ſubmit to that holy Ordinance of Believers
Baptiſm, as appointed by Jeſus Chriſt, and provoke
others thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>5thly.</hi> But further, in their Dedication they appeal
to the honourable Governor, and to the worſhipful
Baker, as to diſintereſted Perſons, and proper Judges.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Henry Seager</hi> the Baker, he is no diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Perſon, unleſs this proves him to be ſuch, becauſe
when he was Mayor, he carried the Mace to the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Meeting, and hath gone to it both before
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150284:36"/>
and ſince the Diſpute, and been a Benefactor to them
for ſeveral years, as is certified from thence.</p>
                  <p>Now I can as little ſuppoſe him to be a proper
Judg, as a diſintereſted Perſon; becauſe I am well
ſatisfied he is unskill'd in the Controverſy, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
as to Parts and Learning to fit him for it:
But being worſhipful, he would ſerve their turn to
make a noiſe with in other Parts where he was not
known, to give a faint Colour to a fading Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>6thly.</hi> But the moſt amazing Paſſage in it is this,
That they ſhould have Confidence to tell the World,
that their Account (they give of the Diſpute) is true
and impartial: That it is what was taken by the Pens
of the Scribes, without any material alteration:
Whereas they know in their Conſciences it is not ſo,
as may be made appear in due place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>7thly.</hi> And whereas they talk of Diſorders in the time
of the Diſpute; they alſo know there was nothing of
that kind committed by us (notwithſtanding their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Provocations) but all of it by themſelves, and
their own Party. Themſelves were certainly, guilty
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> great Incivilities in giving the Lie, in their miſſing,
and making ſuch a noiſe that we could not be heard:
Which was ſo far from being a ſign they were
willing that Truth ſhould take place, that it was an
evident Demonſtration of the direct contrary.</p>
                  <p>I now come to make ſome Obſervations upon the
Account they give of the Diſpute it ſelf: By which
it will appear that it is a falſe and partial Account.</p>
                  <p>1. They have left out the Speech I made in the
beginning.</p>
                  <p>2. Given no account of Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s beginning
with Prayer.</p>
                  <p>3. The Preliminaries agreed upon, and read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
they have wholly omitted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:150284:37"/>
4. Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Apology to the People, which he
calls his Prologue, they have alter'd: For I have
carefully examin'd Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy, and I find it
there verbatim as I have put it down in my Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
For, 1. He puts Pride before Vanity. 2. Adds
Doctrine. 3. Leaves out the New Teſtament. 4. There
is a Tranſpoſition and Omiſſion of other words, which
I paſs by.</p>
                  <p>5. Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> hath alter'd the words of the firſt
Queſtion to be diſputed. As firſt, he hath left out
<hi>and Saviour,</hi> hath put <hi>only</hi> before <hi>are.</hi> And inſtead
of <hi>And not Infants,</hi> he hath put in theſe words, <hi>or
their Infants alſo;</hi> which alters the ſtate of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And in the ſecond Queſtion he hath put in <hi>this</hi>
inſtead of <hi>the,</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> inſtead of <hi>ways;</hi> and it is the
more remarkable, becauſe it differs not only from
mine, but from that written Copy ſigned by Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
and himſelf: So that it muſt either be a heedleſs
or a wilful Act.</p>
                  <p>6. The Speech I made upon Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s repeating
the Queſtions, is part of it left out, and the reſt alter'd.</p>
                  <p>7. In what follows they have left out a whole Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and put down words of their own framing;
and have wholly omitted what I ſay about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Diſputation.</p>
                  <p>8. They put down my firſt Argument by halves,
leaving out theſe words <hi>and Saviour</hi> in the <hi>major;</hi>
and have not expreſſed either the <hi>Subjects</hi> or <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
in the <hi>minor;</hi> and alſo left out the <hi>Concluſion.</hi> Is
this your Impartial Narrative?</p>
                  <p>9. In his firſt Anſwer to this Argument he leaves
out <hi>commanded,</hi> and in the room thereof he puts in
<hi>expreſly, and by name,</hi> which is not in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy.</p>
                  <p>10. He leaves out my whole Reply to him, which
contains nine Lines; and is as pertinent a Reply as
any in the Diſpute: But I ſuppoſe the reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150284:37"/>
the whole Synod of Presbyters that met to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
this Account, were not able to anſwer it.</p>
                  <p>But to hide that from the Reader, he makes a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of his own framing, as if then ſpoken by me;
which is directly contrary to what Mr. <hi>Ring</hi> hath in
his Copy, as ſpoken by me, when Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
my <hi>minor.</hi> So that it muſt be wilful, becauſe they
had Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy by them: For I ſpoke affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
as Mr. <hi>Ring</hi> truly ſaith, and not negatively,
as they ſay.</p>
                  <p>The words I ſpake, as you may ſee in my Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<hi>pag.</hi> 8. beginning, are theſe. By denying the
<hi>minor,</hi> you ſay that Chriſt hath ſome where required
ſome of his Miniſters to baptize Infants, which agrees
with Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Account.</p>
                  <p>But the words in their printed Account are theſe.
<hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Then you ſuppoſe that Chriſt hath no where
required it. What can be more contrary?</p>
                  <p>11. Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> is brought in giving a Negative
Anſwer, when it was not he, but Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> that gave
the Anſwer; and I have put it down verbatim in my
True Narrative, as it is in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy, <hi>viz.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> we diſtinguiſh between conſequential
Truths, and expreſs Words; whereas they have
brought in Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſaying, No, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is this
fair dealing? to change both the Perſon and the
Words alſo: yet this they have done.</p>
                  <p>12. They have alſo tranſpoſed and altered much
that follows in that Page, and have left out about
twenty Lines; particularly that Parallel I made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
an Ambaſſador and a Miniſter of Chriſt, with
relation to our Lord's great Commiſſion, which they
have wholly omitted.</p>
                  <p>13. They have left out Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s words in
anſwer to mine. What, from the Commiſſion? and
yet theſe words are in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy, altho omitted
by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:150284:38"/>
14. They alſo omit Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s words to Mr.
<hi>Chandler,</hi> who cries out, Hold! Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> muſt prove
it by a univerſal Negative. And this they know is in
Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy.</p>
                  <p>15. They alſo omit my Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> viz.
Then Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> muſt deny ſome part of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
which I have not yet been able to prevail
with him to do. This alſo is noted in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s
Copy, but they take no notice of it.</p>
                  <p>16. Here again they repeat my Argument partially,
leaving out that part of it which ſhould give the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reader the greateſt Light, and beſt Information
about it.</p>
                  <p>17. Here (I am well ſatisfied) they abuſe the
dead: For they bring in old Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> ſaying
that which is neither in Mr. <hi>Biſſel</hi> the Town Clerk's
Copy, nor in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s, nor in the old Gentleman's;
whereas it's evident, it was long after that before
Mr. <hi>John Williams</hi> did engage in the Diſpute. The
words they note as ſaid by him are theſe, <hi>any way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why muſt this be done, and marked with an
Aſterisk? why this ſeems to be the Motive, that
they might make their Obſervation upon it (in a
Break made on purpoſe) before the words were, <hi>any
where.</hi> A wonderful Obſervation! But more of this
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>18. They bring me in ſpeaking thus, It's all one to
me, ſo you prove the thing, prove it any way. Upon
this they obſerve in a Break made on purpoſe (that
which is utterly falſe) <hi>viz. He is attempting to ſhift
the Opponency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where were theſe Mens Wits when they made this
Obſervation? Pray obſerve; this was before ever
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> had ſo much as fixt upon any direct
Anſwer to my firſt Argument, as appears by their
own printed Account. And in the following words
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150284:38"/>
they bring him in ſaying, I deny your <hi>minor.</hi> From
whence the Reader may perceive that I was ſo far
from ſhifting off the Opponenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, that I was preſſing
him with all my might to give his Anſwer; and that
I gave him all the ſcope he could deſire: For I allowed
him to do it by Conſequence, or any other way,
which way he pleaſed. But you ſee the Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of theſe Men, that when I was Opponent, and he
Reſpondent, they muſt trifle away ſo much time to
know of me how I would allow them to prove Infant-Baptiſm
(according to the ſtated Queſtion agreed
upon on both ſides long before) when they ſhould
take upon them the Opponency: For till then it was
no part of their buſineſs, but a mere ſhuffle to ſpend
time, leſt they ſhould (by a univerſal Negative) be
forced to aſſign an Inſtance for their Practice from
Scripture, which they knew was impoſſible for them
to do.</p>
                  <p>19. They bring me in ſaying, I prove it thus, only
I would let the People know what you ſay, <hi>viz.</hi>
That Chriſt hath ſome where required his Miniſters
to baptize Infants. Their Note upon it marked with
an Aſterisk, is this: <hi>Somewhere.</hi> The word is again
alter'd from <hi>any way to ſomewhere.</hi> A worthy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
for a Claſſis of Presbyters!</p>
                  <p>But this was not my Anſwer, but an invented one
of their own: For my Anſwer was this, By denying
the <hi>minor,</hi> you ſay, that Chriſt hath ſomewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
ſome of his Miniſters to baptize Infants. And
this I did, that I might give thoſe People to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what we were then upon, who did not know
what was the difference betwixt the <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor,</hi>
and without which they might have been ignorant of
what we had intended in our way of arguing.</p>
                  <p>20. When I called for a plain denial of (any) one
part of my Argument, even what part he pleaſed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150284:39"/>
(as themſelves word it) their Obſervation in a Break
is this, The <hi>Doctor</hi> now ſeems unwilling again to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Scripture-Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>This is to abuſe their Reader: For it was not
Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> but my ſelf, that was Opponent; and
therefore there was no room for him to urge Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
till it came to his turn.</p>
                  <p>21. Yet in the next words they bring in Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>
undertaking the Opponency, which they confeſs he
ought not to have done. But he only talked of it,
but did not do it, for he knew it was a Task too
heavy for him, and ſo waved it.</p>
                  <p>Now there is not one word of all this in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s
Copy, nor in Mr. <hi>Biſſel</hi>'s, nor in mine: And I am
well ſatisfied there was not one word ſpoken by
Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> at that time.</p>
                  <p>22. Upon Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s denying the <hi>minor</hi> of my
univerſal Negative, they have falſified my Anſwer,
and made it quite another thing.</p>
                  <p>For, whereas I ſay to him, Hold, Sir, it is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Negative, you muſt give your Inſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which are the words in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy. They
bring me in, ſaying, It's an univerſal Negative, you
muſt prove it.</p>
                  <p>Now I did not call upon Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> to prove
my Argument, as they do ſlily and diſingenuouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate;
but I call'd upon him to give his Inſtance
where it was ſo written in holy Scripture, that Chriſt
had required any of his Miniſters to baptize Infants;
which I then told him (and do ſtill affirm) he ought
to have done, otherwiſe we might argue <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
And this Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> knew right well; and therefore
he bids Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> offer me the Commiſſion for an
Inſtance, as themſelves have confeſſed in their printed
Account.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> (they tell you) oppoſed it: for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150284:39"/>
he knew there was no ſuch thing expreſt in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and did in effect give away the Cauſe of
Infant-Baptiſm at once: For his words are theſe, (as
recited both in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy, and my True Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.)</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> you muſt prove it ſtill. Suppoſe
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> cannot give an Inſtance, nor no body
in the Company, you cannot thence infer that none
in the World can.</p>
                  <p>23. This alſo they have falſified, and ſet down in
their printed Account a Fancy of their own invention.
They have put in Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> who was not then men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> and have left out theſe words,
nor no body in the Company.</p>
                  <p>Now they know it was urged upon them all, and
deſired that if any one of them could give an Inſtance,
they would pleaſe to do it: And yet none of them
could be prevailed upon ſo much as to attempt it.
Surely the New Teſtament is not ſo large a Volume,
but either Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> or ſome other of thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
that were preſent (whoſe number was ſaid to
be about five and twenty or thirty) might have been
ſuppoſed to have read it all over, and to have known
where ſuch an Inſtance had been written, in caſe any
ſuch thing had been contain'd therein.</p>
                  <p>What, are they all ſo ignorant of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that not one of them can tell what is written
in the New Teſtament about holy Baptiſm? How
then can they be fit to teach others their Duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it? I muſt therefore once more take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to tell them, that when there were ſo many
Men of Parts and Learning together (as there then
were) if none of them are able to give us one Inſtance
from Scripture for their Practice of Infant-Baptiſm,
we cannot expect that any body elſe ſhould.</p>
                  <p>It's much to me, that inſtead of Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150284:40"/>
old Sermons, pick'd out of other Mens Works, they had
not tried their Skill to have attempted ſome Inſtance
from Scripture for their Practice, ſeeing they ſat
brooding upon their Narrative ſo long, as not to ſuffer
it to come abroad till more than ſix Months were paſt
after the Diſpute. Surely they might have found it
out in all that time, if it had been ſo written in the
New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>If therefore Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Sermons are eſteemed
by them as their <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> we muſt conclude they
have nothing of that kind to produce, and therefore
muſt ceaſe for time to come ever to expect it from
them.</p>
                  <p>24. Here they have thruſt in Matter never ſpoken,
and tranſpoſed and mangled what was ſpoken, and
have formed it according to their pleaſure, without
any regard had to Truth or Juſtice. For,</p>
                  <p>(1.) They have made a Speech for Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>
that he never ſpake, and another for Mr. <hi>John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi>
p. 5. And I appeal to Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy, for
there is not one word of either of them there, nor
in any one of the other Copies I ever ſaw.</p>
                  <p>(2.) They leave out (almoſt) a whole Sentence of
mine, and uſe their Art and Skill to deceive the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by making a <hi>ſtroke,</hi> as if it were left out by the
Scribes: Whereas in that part they recite, they
had Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy to inform them, and therefore
muſt know that they did not put it down right;
and ſo have wilfully miſrepreſented me to the World.</p>
                  <p>Their words are as follows. <hi>Ruſ.</hi> I would have
theſe honourable Perſons here preſent to conſider that
I am under great Diſadvantage—you are
to give an Inſtance. What my words are you
may ſee in <hi>pag.</hi> 8. of my Narrative at the lower
end; they are too long to recite: For my whole
Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> contains twelve Lines, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150284:40"/>
theirs is contained in two Lines and a half. Is this
agreable to their Title, <hi>An Impartial Account?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) Their tranſpoſing and altering. For my next
words (which agree with Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Account) are
theſe: Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> this is only a Trick to turn off
the Opponency. Dr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> What do you talk of a
Trick? I hope you are able to give an Inſtance of
what is your daily Practice.</p>
                  <p>But inſtead thereof they put down this falſe Account.
<hi>Rob.</hi> This is your popular Argument to ſhift the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponency,
and turn it upon the Reſpondent. 1. Here
is a change of Perſons, <hi>Rob.</hi> for <hi>Chandler.</hi> 2. They
proceed as they began, and make a Speech for me at
their own pleaſure: And thus they go on till they
come to the next Page. This is a Practice they have
great cauſe to be aſhamed of, when (at the ſame time)
they pretend to give an Impartial Account.</p>
                  <p>25. In <hi>pag.</hi> 6. they bring me in, ſaying, I am ſure,
according to the Rules of Diſpute, Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> muſt
prove the Negative.</p>
                  <p>This I muſt charge as another Falſhood upon them:
For my words are theſe; If you ſay you have no
Scripture-Proof for Infants Baptiſm, I have done. But
why muſt you prevent Mr. <hi>Chandler?</hi> I hope here are
ſome honourable Perſons, and others that underſtand
the nature of this Controverſy; and they may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
expect that thoſe who have made ſuch a noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, can give ſome tolerable Inſtance for it: And
if they will do that, we will proceed to examine it.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore evident, that here is not any thing
like what they report; ſo that if I charge them with
down-right Forgery, they muſt bear with it, for
they knew that my words were according to
Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy, and that they had abuſed both him
and me.</p>
                  <p>26. They have again alter'd Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s next
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:150284:41"/>
Anſwer, and framed words for him that were not
then ſpoken, as appears by Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy, which I
have truly recited in my Narrative, to which I refer
you.</p>
                  <p>27. Here they give an invented Anſwer again;
<hi>Ruſ.</hi> So I deſign if there be no Anſwer given: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
my words are (as Mr. <hi>Ring</hi> hath noted) I have
proved it, till you give your Inſtance; which they
know to be the true ſenſe of what I have put down
in my Narrative.</p>
                  <p>28. <hi>Chand.</hi> Here is an Anſwer, I deny the <hi>minor.</hi>
Now hear what Mr. <hi>Ring</hi> ſaith. <hi>Robinſon.</hi> If you
will change ſides, Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> you may admit this
Trick. In this they have both changed the words,
and the Perſons ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>29. They have alſo invented an Anſwer for me,
directly contrary to Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy.</p>
                  <p>30. They have invented a Speech for Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi>
of which there is not one word in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy.</p>
                  <p>31. Here they have tranſpoſed Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s words,
and left out the one half of them, as they are in
Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy.</p>
                  <p>32. Here they have brought me in anſwering
Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> thus: This is no changing ſides; for I
do not deſign to quit the Opponency, only let him
bring an Inſtance.</p>
                  <p>Whereas I have truly repreſented the Anſwer I
gave in <hi>p.</hi> 9. of my Narrative, according to Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s
Copy, where you will find that the Anſwer was given
in other words; and not to Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> but to
Mr. <hi>Chandler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. But why muſt this be put in here? They tell'
you, the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s deſign even now was to turn the
Opponency on us, as I can prove (ſaith he) from a
Letter of Mr. <hi>John Williams:</hi> But now he will not quit
the Opponency, and yet expects a Scripture-proof for
Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:150284:41"/>
To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>(1.) That no Man in the World could have known
this, if I had ſo deſigned, for I never ſaid ſo: And
it's God only that knows the Heart.</p>
                  <p>(2.) I do now tell all the World (as I then told
you) that I had no ſuch deſign.</p>
                  <p>(3.) What you ſay of (the deceaſed) Mr. <hi>John
Williams</hi> is utterly falſe: For he hath not ſo written
in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> altho he hath the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to tell the World that he can prove it from
Mr. <hi>John William</hi>'s Letter. For I have a Copy of
his Letter writ by himſelf, and ſigned with his own
hand, and there are not thoſe words, that I deſigned
to turn the Opponency upon you, as you ſay. The
genuine ſenſe of his words is, to let you know what
you might have done to have ſhewed your Parts in
the Vindication of your beloved Practice, if you
had given an Inſtance when I run you upon it by an
univerſal Negative, and ſaid you ought to have done
it according to the Rules of Diſpute: And that the
World may be ſatisfied herein, both Mr. <hi>John Sharp</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his Sons have cauſed it to be printed,
as containing ſuch things in it as are of uſe to the
Publick with relation to the Diſputation.</p>
                  <p>34. They have introduced Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> making a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Speech, of which there is not one word in any
of the Copies I have ſeen. But in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy,
Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> is the Speaker, which agrees with my
Narrative. But why is this done? The reaſon ſeems
to be this, 1. To darken the Peoples Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that they might not diſcern their Fallacy.
2. To throw the Reflection off from themſelves, and
caſt it (as much as they can) upon Dr. <hi>Smith;</hi> for
which he hath no reaſon to thank them. The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(they ſay Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> put) was this: I deſire, Sir,
you would declare, whether Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> be not obliged
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:150284:42"/>
to prove the Negative he hath aſſerted? Now, as I
do not know any thing of it, ſo there is not one word
in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy, neither of that nor any thing
elſe that Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſpake at that time.</p>
                  <p>But if Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> had ſo ſpoken, there had been as little
ſenſe in it as was in Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s words, when he
called a Negative an Affirmative. But any thing ſerves
to veil over a bad Cauſe. For, to ſet this in a clearer
Light, I will give the Reader a view of the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and ſhew him how I brought them to that
iſſue upon it: And I might have forbore to have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
with them any longer, unleſs they had given
their Inſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If Chriſt hath no where required any of
his Miniſters to baptize Infants, then the Baptiſm of
Infants is not according to the Commiſſion of our
Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt hath no where required any of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to baptize Infants:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Baptiſm of Infants is not according to
the Commiſſion of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> after divers ſhifts and evaſions about
the <hi>major,</hi> ſays thus, I deny your <hi>minor.</hi> My Anſwer
to him was, By denying the <hi>minor,</hi> you ſay that Chriſt
hath ſomewhere required ſome of his Miniſters to
baptize Infants. This being by them allowed, I did
proceed to make good my <hi>minor</hi> thus.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt hath any where required any of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to baptize Infants, it's ſomewhere ſo recorded
in the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>But it's no where ſo recorded in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt hath not any where required any of
his Miniſters to baptize Infants.</p>
                  <p>Upon this (after a Queſtion put, and a Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon it) Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſaid, I deny the <hi>minor:</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:150284:42"/>
My Anſwer was, Then you ſay it's ſomewhere ſo
recorded in holy Scripture. I therefore argued thus.</p>
                  <p>If it be any where ſo recorded in holy Scripture,
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> or ſome other Perſon is able to ſhew it.</p>
                  <p>But neither Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> nor any other Perſon
whatſoever, is able to ſhew it:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is not any where ſo recorded in holy
Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſaid, I deny your <hi>minor.</hi>
Now by denying my <hi>minor,</hi> I appeal to all that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
an Argument, whether in ſo doing he doth
not aſſert, that he or ſome other were able to ſhew
where it is recorded in holy Scripture, that Chriſt
hath required any of his Miniſters to baptize Infants.
And this is to go their own way. But I told him it
was an univerſal Negative, and therefore he muſt give
his Inſtance where it is ſo written, but could by no
means bring him to it; and the reaſon was becauſe he
had none to give; and till he doth, my Argument will
ſtand good, as I then told him: For otherwiſe we
may argue <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and never bring any thing to
an iſſue. And I do once more challenge them to
produce one ſingle Inſtance for their Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>After a tedious Diſcourſe upon it, Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>
ſaid, I appeal to any that underſtand Logick, whether
this be ſufferable for him thus to turn the Opponency
upon Mr. <hi>Chandler?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſtood up and ſaid, If I muſt ſpeak,
then by your leave, according to what I always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
He that aſſerts muſt prove.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon I anſwer'd, Then they having aſſerted
that Infants are the Subjects of Baptiſm, they are to
prove their Practice, eſpecially when they are forced
upon it by an univerſal Negative: We deſire but
one ſingle Inſtance, and they will not aſſign it.</p>
                  <p>35. But when they pretend to recite Dr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:150284:43"/>
words, they deal as unworthily by him as they had done
by me: For they bring him in ſaying, according to
the Rules of Diſputation, <hi>Negantis non eſt probare;</hi> or,
<hi>Aſſerenti incumbit probatio.</hi> He ſaid the one, or the
other, they tell you: But they do not ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
he ſaid both. What muſt the Reader conclude
from hence? but that they did not, or would not
know what he did ſay. For by the ſame Rule they
ſay it was this, or that, and are not certain which it
was, it might as well be neither; but only what I
have ſaid according to Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy. And thus
after they have wracked their Brains to evade the
force of this Argument, on purpoſe to ſhift off the
giving an Inſtance out of holy Scripture for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural
Practice, they have only fulfilled the old
Proverb, <hi>Parturiunt montes, naſcitur ridiculus mus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, if he had ſaid, <hi>negantis non eſt probare,</hi> he that
denies is not bound to prove, as they would perſwade
us he did, what advantage would it have been to
them? I was upon the Negative, and had iſſued my
firſt Argument by a univerſal Negative, which can
never be invalidated without an Inſtance: Certainly
then (according to that) I was not obliged to prove
my Denial (but the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to give their Inſtance) for I
had proved that before by ſuch Arguments as they
were not then, nor yet ſince have been able by all
their Learning to confute.</p>
                  <p>But themſelves are doubtful whether Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſaid
ſo, and therefore tell us, if he did not ſay that, he
ſaid, <hi>Aſſerenti incumbit probatio,</hi> which is the ſame
with what Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy ſaith: He that aſſerts
muſt prove. But I do not believe he ſaid either of
them in Latin (not that I doubt of his ability ſo to
do, for I have heard a good Character of him from a
Phyſician, who ſaid he knew him in the Univerſity)
for, as I my ſelf know not any ſuch thing, ſo Mr. <hi>Ring,</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:150284:43"/>
who hath ſeveral times took notice of the Greek
words ſpoken both by me and them, only ſets down
Dr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s words in Engliſh: And whoever obſerves
my Anſwer, muſt needs know that I underſtood it ſo,
by telling them, that they having aſſerted Infant-Baptiſm,
ought to prove their Practice, by ſhewing
us where it was ſo written in the holy Scriptures; we
demanding of them but only a ſingle Inſtance, by
which the Controverſy would have been at an end.
So that they have labour'd in vain, and ſpent their
Strength for nought; leaving the Multitude (as they
call them) as wiſe as they found them, and ſo they
are like to remain (ſo far as I can perceive) if they
expect ſatisfaction from them. For they that want
Light themſelves, cannot impart it to others.</p>
                  <p>36. Here they ſham a Forgery upon me, bringing
me in ſaying, Well, what muſt I do? As if I had
been at a loſs what to ſay, and muſt ask them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
me; whereas they know in their Conſciences, I
did not uſe to be at a loſs to anſwer them, when
three or four of them have very uncivilly fallen upon
me at once; but it pleaſed God to keep me in a
compoſed frame of Spirit, and to aſſiſt me under it
beyond what I could have expected. But ſuppoſe I
had been at a loſs, can the Reader think I would
have told them ſo, and ask'd their Advice what to
do? This is as improbable a Story, as Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s
lying Invention about <hi>Iſaac Harman,</hi> wherein he
was diſproved to his face before divers of his Hearers.
But however, he is unwilling to be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
the Truth, but inſtead thereof (in their ſecond
Edition) ſeems only to make a weak excuſe, by
ſaying a ſilly Woman told him ſo; when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
the Story in Print as a thing of his own
knowledg: And to cloſe his Story, he tells us he ſhall
no more trouble the World with perſonal matters,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150284:44"/>
but give <hi>Pilate</hi>'s ſurly Anſwer to all ſuch, <hi>What I
have written, I have written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to come to the matter in hand, I know what
they have ſaid here to be utterly falſe, and contrary
to Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy, as they alſo know: But I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
they are reſolved to ſay any thing, tho never
ſo untrue, and againſt their knowledg, to avoid the
ſhame (if they could) of being baffled in their Cauſe
at the Diſputation.</p>
                  <p>37. Again, they bring in another invented Story,
and make Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> to ſpeak what he did not
ſpeak, and Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> to be of his mind. I muſt here
vindicate Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> again: For, if their own Story
(as I have before obſerved) be true, that Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>
ſhould ask him this Queſtion, Whether Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> be
not obliged to prove the Negative he hath aſſerted?
and he ſhould anſwer as they ſay, <hi>Negantis non eſt
probare,</hi> he that denies is not to prove; with what
fairneſs could he tell the World that Gentleman was
of his mind? And this they doubted would be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and therefore they did not only put the words
in Latin, but leave an excuſe if they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
by declaring, if he did not ſay ſo, he ſaid
otherwiſe, as is before noted.</p>
                  <p>38. He doth alſo miſrepreſent my words in telling
the World I ſaid, How do you mean prove, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
I have no ſuch words, nor any thing like them. But
ſeeing they have invented a Reply for me, I deſire
they would anſwer it alſo. They ſay, the total ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Scripture in this matter is Proof. If I had
ſaid ſo, there had been no reaſon to have denied it:
For I acknowledg the Aſſertion to be true, tho not
then ſpoken by me. But it may now be expected
they ſhould make ſome Anſwer to it that might inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idate
it; but they only ſet it down, and then run
away from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:150284:44"/>
Sirs, I deſire you ſeriouſly to conſider, what you
have ſaid herein againſt your own Practice: Is it not
a part of Divine Worſhip? is it not that Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Baptiſm as inſtituted by Chriſt, that is the
matter (in general) of our Diſputation? And is it
not about the Subjects in particular that we were then
ſpeaking of? And were not you called upon with great
earneſtneſs, and preſſing importunity, to give us but
one Inſtance where it was found written in the Holy
Scriptures, That Chriſt had required any of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to baptize Infants? And do you (after all)
tacitly acknowledg that there is a total ſilence of
Scripture in this matter? Surely it is time then for
you to quit your practice, if the Scripture ſays not
one word about it. And if Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s Suppoſition
be allow'd, it muſt needs be ſo. Suppoſe (ſaith he)
Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> cannot give an Inſtance, nor no body in
the company; you cannot thence infer that none in
the World can. To which I anſwer'd, This is in
effect to give away your Cauſe, when there are ſo
many Men of Parts and Learning preſent; for if none
of them are able to give us one Inſtance from Scripture
for Infant-Baptiſm, we cannot expect that any body
elſe ſhould. And yet all the Anſwer they gave, was,
to tell us this is only a Trick to turn off the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
notwithſtanding I told them the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Surely this is no better than tricking in them,
thus to fence againſt thoſe ſolid Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that none of them are able to anſwer; and yet
have the confidence to tell the World in print, <hi>p.</hi> 66.
That all the Arguments we offer'd were trifling Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.
Is this your <hi>Impartial Account?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>38. Here they have left out ſeveral things that paſt
betwixt me and Mr. <hi>Chandler;</hi> which they have paſt
over with a total ſilence, becauſe they did not make
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150284:45"/>
for their Cauſe, but againſt it. Is not this great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality?</p>
                  <p>39. They bring in Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> ſaying, <hi>If you can
proceed no farther upon this, then it's time you go on.</hi>
Now this is alſo untrue; neither is there one word of
it in Mr. <hi>Ring</hi>'s Copy. But the words he ſaith I told
them, are theſe; <hi>If you will ſay no more to this, I
will proceed to another Argument.</hi> And they know,
right-well, that I urg'd this, That if Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>
would confeſs he had no Inſtance to give, I would
then proceed to a new Argument. And further, that
upon his refuſal ſo to do, I did challenge the reſt of
them to give an Inſtance; and provok'd them to it,
telling them, That if they refuſed to do it, the People
would think they had none to give. And yet none of
them could be prevail'd upon to do it. Whereupon I
ſpake to this effect, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> it may be you think I
have but one Argument; If you will ſay no more to
this, I am not willing to tire the Auditory, I will
therefore proceed to a new Argument.</p>
                  <p>But take notice (by the way) that my firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſtands good till you give your Inſtance to the
contrary. And all this they wholly omitted in their
printed Account, becauſe (perhaps they thought) it
would have been ſufficiently evidenced how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
they had been baffled and put to ſilence before
the People, for want of one ſingle Inſtance for their
practice.</p>
                  <p>Here I deſire the Reader to take notice, that I am
not yet fully advanced ſo far as three Leaves and a
half in their printed Account of the Diſputation; and
having diſcover'd ſo many Errors in ſo little a compaſs,
it amazes me to think what was become of theſe
Mens-Conſciences, who could contrive an Account
to publiſh to the World, with ſo ſmall regard to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150284:45"/>
Truth and Fidelity; when at the ſame time they ſend
it forth with that plauſible pretence of <hi>An Impartial
Account.</hi> What may the Reader expect to find in
the whole body of it, if there be ſo many Faults in
the very Entrance? But I have other Buſineſs, than
to attend to the remarking of all they ſay of this
kind: for, if I ſhould do that, I muſt write a much
bigger Volume than is proper upon this occaſion, there
being ſo many Errors committed by them throughout
the whole of their Book.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 65. they confeſs, that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> was baptized
by dipping. He was dipp'd (ſay they) not at <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi>
but <hi>Havant.</hi> It is not ſaid by Mr. <hi>Duke</hi> that he
was dipp'd at <hi>Goſport,</hi> that obſervation therefore was
needleſs: but that he was dipp'd, they confeſs, which
is the thing aſſerted by him. But they ſay 'tis falſe
that it was done by Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s advice, for he was
then at <hi>London:</hi> Now it doth not follow that Mr.
<hi>Chandler</hi> did not give ſuch advice, becauſe he was (as
he ſaith) then at <hi>London;</hi> for I have receiv'd a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to prove it, under the hands of two Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Leddell</hi> writes thus, I ſhall further annex one
Teſtimony touching Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> which was ſpoken

                  <p>I would further note, That they might have ſpared
their Reflection upon our Brother <hi>Duke,</hi> if they had
but minded theſe words in my Dedication, <hi>And by
another hand I have this Account.</hi> And after all, they
thus expreſs themſelves in their own printed Account,
<hi>pag.</hi> 65. <q>But that none of us would refuſe to dip a
Perſon in ſuch a caſe, is true; We never pleading
againſt Dipping as <hi>one</hi> way, but as the only way;
not againſt its Lawfulneſs, but Neceſſity.</q> How
doth this agree with what Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith in <hi>pag.</hi> 51.
I deny that the word <hi>Baptize</hi> ſignifies to dip, in any
place of Scripture? But ſeeing Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſpoken to it, I ſhall paſs it by.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall remark one thing more, and that is, That
theſe Gentlemen are pleaſed to reflect upon me about
ſpeaking falſe Greek: As they have alſo done upon
Mr. <hi>John Goſnold,</hi> by ſaying, I abuſe him in it, when
they are his very words I recite, and the ſame words
uſed <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. So that rather than I ſhall eſcape their
Laſh, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (whoſe words they are) muſt
alſo be whipt till he learn better, if he come under the
tuterage of their unmannerly Pedagogue. What, do
theſe Men think no body underſtand <hi>Greek</hi> but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
                  <p>But after all, tho they do not charge me with
printing any falſe <hi>Greek</hi> in my Narrative (as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
yet they would perſwade the World, that I
have got an Art to form <hi>Greek</hi> Letters in the Air, ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150284:46"/>
that they can diſcern them, when I expreſs them
with my Voice. And in order to convince their
Reader, they have put down thoſe <hi>Greek</hi> words
wrong in their Narrative, which are printed truly in
mine, but falſly in theirs. But any thing to render me
ignorant and ridiculous, ſerves theſe mens turn, tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo falſe in it ſelf. But if I were really as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
as they repreſent me to be, as Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told them, I had been the more eaſily confuted.
I ſhall therefore commit what I have written to the
Judgment of the Learned and Impartial Reader, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
to the World, That my Narrative is much
more impartial than theirs, and the beſt I knew how
to publiſh; which they have only marr'd, and not
mended.</p>
                  <p>To conclude: Seeing this is ſo, why doth Mr. <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dler,
p.</hi> 19. ſay, that if we will keep ſtrictly to the
ſignificancy of a Burial, the Perſon baptized muſt not
walk into the Water, but be taken up by the Baptizer
and thrown into it? for indeed we baptize the
Face (ſaith he) and they baptize the Head and
Shoulders too. And (a little after he ſaith) they had
need have brawny Arms and an Herculean Strength
to do this, ſpeaking of the Apoſtles baptizing three
thouſand in one day with the help of the ſeventy
Diſciples; and endeavours to render the thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
As for the poſſibility of it I refer you to the
learned Dr. <hi>Du-Veil</hi>'s Anſwer to this Objection, in
his Explication upon the place.</p>
                  <p>But as touching the manner of baptizing by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
why do you thus quibble about it, and make as if
it could not be perform'd aright, if the Subject were
not taken up by the Adminiſtrator, and thrown into
the Water? It's confeſs'd by your ſelves in Print that
Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> was dipp'd; and in the account which I
have received it appears, that when Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> was ask'd
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150284:47"/>
this Queſtion, Whether, when he was baptized by
Mr. <hi>Earl,</hi> it was done by dipping the whole Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Water? he ſaid, it was; and that in the preſence
of four Presbyterian Miniſters, which they do not
deny in their printed Anſwer, but ſay that he was
dipp'd.</p>
                  <p>And did Mr. <hi>Earl</hi> indeed baptize Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
as you confeſs, by ſaying, he was dipp'd at
<hi>Havant?</hi> I hope he did not take him up and carry
(or throw) him into the Water to dip him; if ſo,
we may know where to have a Man that hath brawny
Arms and Herculean Strength. But we do ſuppoſe he
went with him into the Water (as we do) and when
they were both in the Water, Mr. <hi>Earl</hi> did then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
him by dipping, as our conſtant Practice is; and
this they call dipping. And we do not find that any
of thoſe four Miniſters preſent did object againſt it,
as not being the right manner of performing it. Nay,
theſe Gentlemen in their printed Account do not deny
the lawfulneſs of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hath been obſerved.</p>
                  <p>And why (after all this) they ſhould quarrel with
us, we cannot underſtand, when they practiſe it after
the ſame manner as we do, and call it dipping.</p>
                  <p>I will add the Teſtimony of a learned Man to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
our Practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucas Brugenſis</hi> upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. ſaith, the Party bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
went into the Water as deep as his Thighs, or
Navel; the reſt of his Body was dipp'd, not ſprinkled.</p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>John Calvin</hi> ſaith upon <hi>John</hi> 3. 22, 23.
That <hi>John</hi> and Chriſt adminiſtred Baptiſm by plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole Body into the Water: and he confeſſes
the Church hath aſſumed to her ſelf this liberty of
ſprinkling. But having given them ſuch a Cloud of
Witneſſes in the Diſpute, I ſhall not here recite them.</p>

TO A
DIALOGUE
Between a Pedo-Baptiſt and an
Anti-Pedo-Baptiſt,</p>
                  <p>Publiſhed by <hi>Samuel Chandler,</hi> and
<hi>William Leigh,</hi> by the Advice of their
Brethren from divers Parts.</p>
                  <p>Written by one, who was refer'd to the
Account of the Diſpute at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> &amp;c.
for his Conviction, but hath ſince ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <head>Some brief ANIMADVERSIONS
by Dr. Ruſſel, upon their Epiſtle to the
Reader.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt thing they begin with is wholly falſe:
For they ſay, Becauſe Dr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> or ſome Friend
of his, did a while ſince diſgrace the Preſs with
ſome ſcraps of their Narrative, ſtuff'd with Nonſenſe
and Partiality; nay, and by its Title did delude the
Vulgar with an Imagination, that it contained the true
State of the <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Diſputation; and the ſame,
how unjuſt ſoever, being cheap, hath been ſcatter'd
throughout moſt parts of this Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, That neither Dr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> nor any
of his Friends did ever publiſh any ſuch Paper, nor any
other Paper about the Diſpute at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> beſides
their True Narrative, but only an Anſwer to Monſieur
<hi>Berault,</hi> wherein they are ſcarcely ſo much as named.
But this Paper they ſpeak of (to uſe their own words)
was pirated into the World with my Name affixed to
it, without my Knowledg or Conſent, therefore I am
not chargeable with any Dafects or Imperfections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
tho they are pleaſed unjuſtly to caſt it upon me. But
any thing will ſerve your turns to reproach me with,
tho never ſo falſe and uncharitable: Your Rage againſt
me, is a plain Demonſtration of your being baffled at
the Diſputation, tho you have not humility enough to
acknowledg it to the World.</p>
                  <p>May not I with as much Juſtice charge the Abſtract
of your Account upon you? But I have more Charity
than to think ſo. And whereas you have put an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſment
into the <hi>Poſt-man, Nov.</hi> 7. 1699. to diſown
it, and ſay, Whereas a Twopenny Paper hath been
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:150284:48"/>
pirated into the World bearing our Names, and called,
<hi>An Impartial Account of the</hi> Portſmouth <hi>Diſputation,</hi>
we declare it was printed without our Knowledg or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
And this being the firſt opportunity we have to
print upon this occaſion, we have told the World the ſame
that you do; and therefore thoſe ſilly Reflections of yours
might have been ſpared. There are ſome ſuch ill Men
belonging to the Printing Trade as will abuſe any body's
Works, by contracting and mangling them to get a
Penny by; ſo that the beſt of Authors cannot eſcape
being abuſed: And if you had but minded your own
Advertiſement, you might have known that without
giving me the trouble of this publick way of informing
you.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe needleſs and vaunting Expreſſions
about the ſtrength of the Arguments in your Dialogue,
the Reader muſt be Judg of that; and therefore I ſhall
not anticipate by making any Reflections thereupon;
but deſire him to conſider the Anſwer this Gentleman
hath given; and then I doubt not but he will ſee you
had no reaſon to boaſt of your ſtrength, before you had
obtained ſo much as a ſeeming Victory. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude in your own words: We requeſt of them
that they would weigh it in the Balance of Scripture
and ſanctified Reaſon; and the Lord give them <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in all things, which is the deſire of him,
who is a Lover of the Souls of all Men, and of his
Antagoniſts in particular, being in Charity with them,
tho they are not ſo with him.</p>

BEING
An ANSWER to Mr. Chandler's and
Mr. Leigh's Dialogue.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt Argument (ſay they) the Anti-Pedo-Baptiſt
offers is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. No Infants can be made Diſciples
by the Miniſtry of Men; therefore no Infants can be
the Subjects of Baptiſm, according to Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<hi>Mat. 28. 19. Go teach,</hi> &amp;c. (or <hi>diſciple) all
Nations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 5. the Anſwer they give to it is as follows,
I deny your whole Argument.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Diſpute they diſtinguiſhed on the
word <hi>Diſciple,</hi> ſome were compleat, others incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat;
I perceive the Gentlemen are aſhamed of their
former Defence, and it ſeems to me they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of its weakneſs; and now they will be mad in
earneſt, and deny the whole Argument.</p>
                  <p>They aſſert, 1. If they could not be made Diſciples
by the Miniſtry of Men, yet this Text would not
exclude them from Baptiſm; but with what reaſon
do they do this? none at all truly; and therefore
obſerve how this bold Aſſertion will ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles to diſciple all Nations, and
then to baptize them; They affirm, if the Apoſtles
could not diſciple ſome, yet they might baptize
them; this Text excludes all but Diſciples from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm:
they I ſay affirm the contrary without Proof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:150284:49"/>
That which they anſwer, <hi>p.</hi> 6. This is a weak way
of arguing. I anſwer, If the order of words ſignify
nothing in the Commiſſion as they feign, Why do
they not baptize the Adult firſt, and teach them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
I would I could hear their Anſwer to this.
Not only the Practice of the Primitive Churches, but
even all down to this day, yea even themſelves keep
to the order of the words in this place, and teach the
Adult before they baptize them: So that it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
ſome ought to be taught before they are baptized,
even by virtue of the Commiſſion; let them prove by
the ſame Commiſſion that ſome may be baptized
before they are taught if they can.</p>
                  <p>But ſome were baptized confeſſing their Sins:
Weakly urged! for that Particle (confeſſing) doth
not in propriety of Speech import that their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was after their Baptiſm, but rather the contrary,
confeſſing their Sins they were baptized. But if the
order of words in ſome places were not ſtrictly to be
obſerved, that they are not to be obſerved here is a
weak way of arguing indeed; and ſeeing themſelves
keep to the order of the words in reſpect of the
Adult, but not in Infants, let them ſhew reaſon for
this in the Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>But Infants may be Diſciples by teaching, <hi>viz.</hi> by
their Parents being taught, becauſe the <hi>Kohathites</hi> in
their Parents are ſaid to keep the charge of the
Sanctuary from a Month old, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is falſe: the Children of a Month old are not
ſaid to keep the Charge of the Sanctuary in their
Parents, as you affirm; but all their Males, the
young as well as the old, are ſaid to keep the Charge
of the Sanctuary. And that the Charge was ſuch
that Children of a Month old could not be ſaid to
keep it, let them ſhew if they can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:150284:50"/>
But <hi>Levi</hi> paid Tithes in <hi>Abraham. Anſw.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the great Grandfather's Learning makes the
Grandchild a Scholar. O excellent Logick! By the
ſame reaſon I will prove the Children of Heathens
to be the Scholars and Diſciples of Chriſt, and ſo may
be baptized, becauſe ſome of their Anceſtors, <hi>Adam,
Noah,</hi> &amp;c. were taught and made Diſciples.</p>
                  <l>There did we rejoice—</l>
                  <p>If the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did rejoice in their Anceſtors on
the Banks of the Red Sea, then <hi>Judas</hi> believed in his
Anceſtors at the Red Sea, and was a true Diſciple;
and ſo the Infants of unbelieving Jews believed in
ſome of their Anceſtors, and therefore are Diſciples,
and may be baptized.</p>
                  <p>Let the force then of their Scripture-Inſtances be
weighed, and you will ſee what broken Reeds they
bring to ſupport their Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag. 6. line</hi> 23. By the preaching of Men, Parents
may be conſtrained to reſign their All to God, and
ſo their Infants.</p>
                  <p>How is baptizing Infants a reſigning them to God?
What Scripture or Reaſon for this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Line</hi> 25. They (<hi>viz.</hi> Infants) are immediately
diſcipled by Mens Miniſtry, when Parents and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
concur in their ſolemn Dedication to God by
Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Then Baptiſm is not the Dedication of the Infant
to God; for, ſay they, the Parents and Miniſter
concur in their Dedication: but the Parents and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
do not concur in their Baptiſm, for that is
the ſole Act of the Miniſter; therefore Infants are
not dedicated by Baptiſm, theſe Diſputants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
being Judges againſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Line</hi> 30. The Maſter doth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is altogether foreign to the Controverſy, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:150284:50"/>
I muſt again obſerve that they have utterly rejected
their Diſtinction of compleat and incompleat Diſciples:
And now the reſignation of the Parents and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of the Maſter is the only means to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
the relation between Maſter and Scholar.</p>
                  <p>Here I demand, 1. where Chriſt hath manifeſted
his acceptance of all ſuch as are ſprinkled in his Name,
and hath undertaken to be their Maſter.</p>
                  <p>2. If Chriſt hath undertaken the Tutorage of all
ſuch, whence is it all ſuch do not learn of him? Can
Chriſt fail in his Undertaking?</p>
                  <p>If there be any that won't be convinc'd that Infants
are to be baptized by ſuch wiſe Reaſonings, let them
let it alone, and be in their Wits ſtill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag. 6. l.</hi> 33. If Teaching were the ground of this
Relation, then Perſons long ſince dead might be our
Governors.</p>
                  <p>O ſtrange! What an Abſurdity is here! What
Fools were the Jews to ſay, <hi>We are</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Diſciples?</hi>
Their Argument is this.</p>
                  <p>It is abſurd to ſay Teaching is the ground of the
relation of Maſter and Scholar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, the former Age and their Fathers ſhall
teach thee, therefore <hi>Job</hi> ſpake abſurdly. O rare
Diſputants, that would charge Folly upon the holy
Spirit himſelf!</p>
                  <p>Were theſe Mens Eyes in their heads, that bring
Scripture to confute themſelves?</p>
                  <p>Nay the Beaſts of the Field may be our Maſters too,
Job 35. 11. <hi>Who teacheth us more than the Beaſts of
the field, and maketh us wiſer than the Fowls of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
for ſo it follows in the ſame Verſe. The ſenſe
then is either, that none can teach us more than the
Beaſts of the Field can teach us, and ſo theſe Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
would perſwade us that the Beaſts are our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
And truly had theſe Gentlemen but attended
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:150284:51"/>
well to what might have been learned of the Beaſts
and the Fowls, they would not have ſo much deſpiſed
theſe Maſters.</p>
                  <p>But alas! theſe Gentlemen who would now ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
themſelves to the World by ſome new ſtrains of
Wit, have altogether miſtook the meaning of the
Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. None ſaith, Where is God my Maker,
who giveth Songs in the night; who teacheth us more
than the Beaſts of the Earth, and maketh us wiſer than
the Fowls of Heaven? <hi>In which words</hi> Elihu <hi>affirms,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That God giveth Songs in the Night, <hi>i. e.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Praiſe.</p>
                  <p>2. That God teacheth Men more (<hi>viz.</hi>) more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things than he teacheth to the Beaſts of the
Earth, or to the Fowls of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Pray, wherein doth the holy Spirit in this place
teach us that the Beaſts of the Field may be our
Maſters?</p>
                  <p>And tho this is not in the Text, yet I fear not to
grant, that what thing ſoever is ſaid to teach us, may
be called our Teacher, without any Diſgrace to that
Aſſertion they would here oppoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Learning make the relation between Maſter
and Scholar.</p>
                  <p>I wonder they omitted their celebrated Diſtinction
of compleat and incompleat Diſciples: What can
that do nothing now, that did ſo much before? The
Achillean Shield is not worth a Contention for.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe they ſay they expected the <hi>Doctor</hi>
ſhould have ſhewn that that Diſtinction was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
and did not ſpeak directly to it: If leave might
be given me, I would preſs them thus.</p>
                  <p>No unſcriptural Diſtinction is to be admitted in
any controverted Point of Divinity (the reaſon is,
becauſe the Scripture is to be the only Judg.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:150284:51"/>
This Diſtinction of compleat and incompleat Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
is an unſcriptural Diſtinction (becauſe neither the
words or ſenſe thereof is to be found in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> This Diſtinction is not to be admitted in any
controverted Point of Divinity: And therefore not
in this now under conſideration.</p>
                  <p>2. If Chriſt ſent not his Apoſtles to make incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Diſciples, then they made none ſuch, nor could
baptize ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Again, he that is a Diſciple only in an imperfect
ſenſe, in perfect ſenſe is no Diſciple at all.</p>
                  <p>A Child (ſaith Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> in his Narrative, <hi>p.</hi> 11.)
in an imperfect ſenſe is deemed a Scholar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> In perfect ſenſe he is no Diſciple at all.</p>
                  <p>So that, our Adverſaries being Judges, it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Senſe, and conſequently Nonſenſe to call a Child
uncapable of Learning, a Scholar.</p>
                  <p>And I hope they will allow good Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>I return now to our Dialogue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg. 2. pag. 7. line</hi> 9. Neither ever did <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>Paul</hi> did declare Believers were to be
baptized, and therefore not Infants; we being able
to prove Believers Baptiſm, and you being able to
ſhew no other: Therefore Believers Children ought
to be delayed till they can perſonally profeſs their
Faith.</p>
                  <p>But you hope to prove Infant-Baptiſm from <hi>Paul</hi>'s
words, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 14. Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>You hope, but are not ſure; <hi>Hope that is ſeen
is not Hope; for what a Man ſeeth, why doth he yet
hope for?</hi> Becauſe you do not ſee Infant-Baptiſm in
thoſe Texts with clear Evidence, therefore you hope
but in vain: Only I commend your Modeſty here,
'twere Wiſdom to give up a vain Hope.</p>

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:150284:52"/>
Here is much ſtuff, and impertinent enough in this
Page, about the Hiſtory of the World, Ceremonial
Law, Prophecies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed we cannot ſay this or
that Epiſtle contains all Articles of Faith: And tho
<hi>Paul</hi> did declare all the Counſel of God, yet he
might not write all; this is rational enough. But thus
I would argue: If the Scripture is a perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Rule of Faith and Practice, and in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
no mention is made of Infant-Baptiſm; then
Infant-Baptiſm is not to be believed to be of Divine
Inſtitution, nor to be practiſed by the Saints: The
former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. Pray take your Argument back again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt's Commiſſion doth expreſly ſhew who are to
be baptized; but it doth not expreſly ſhew that Adult
Perſons, if baptized in Infancy, are to be baptized
again: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; The <hi>minor</hi> is falſe for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Becauſe in every poſitive Command the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is forbidden. Diſciples in the Commiſſion are
commanded to be baptized; therefore the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
forbids to baptize thoſe that are not Diſciples, as
are Infants.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Infant-ſprinkling is not Baptiſm; ſurely that
cannot be Chriſt's Baptiſm, in which there is not a
Subject according to Chriſt's Command, nay tho the
Infant were dipped into the Water, no more than if
a Heathen Perſon were ſo dipped againſt his Will, it
could be called Chriſt's Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>And methinks you will hardly deliver your ſelves
from our Argument ſo well as we are delivered from
yours. But let's hear.</p>
                  <p>2. I deny that Infants or Adult Perſons are diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expreſſed in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. for both are included in
the word <hi>Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Diſciples are expreſſed, and Infants in no good
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:150284:52"/>
ſenſe are Diſciples, then the Subjects are diſtinctly
expreſſed: but the former is true; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If all Nations be the Subject of Baptiſm, according
to Chriſt's Commiſſion, without reſpect to being
taught, then all may be baptized without being taught:
but the Antecedent is abſurd; <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
And what can you ſhew in the Commiſſion
that will authorize you to baptize the Infant of a
Chriſtian more than the Infant of a Heathen?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. If they are underſtood, then they are not
expreſſed: you have confuted your ſelf.</p>
                  <p>As if what is underſtood, was not expreſſed to the
Underſtanding: the word for <hi>them</hi> is Maſculine, but
that for <hi>Nations</hi> of the Neuter; the agreement is
not between theſe words: For if the Apoſtles were
commanded to baptize all Nations without the modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
there expreſſed, <hi>viz. taught,</hi> then the Infants
of Heathens, by virtue of this Commiſſion, have as
much right to Baptiſm as the Infants of Chriſtians;
yea Unbelievers had as good claim to that Ordinance
as Believers: all which is abſurd, and therefore the
word <hi>them</hi> muſt have relation to Believers, to Men
diſcipled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag. 9. l.</hi> 8. Infants may as well be Believers impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively
in their Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is anſwered before, the Text ſaith not as they
feign, that the Infants of the <hi>Kohathites</hi> did in their
Parents keep the Charge of the Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>Parents Faith may be imputed to Infants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
There was nothing of the Parents coming to Chriſt
imputed to the Infants, 'tis altogether vain ſtuff.
Our Bleſſings come not on us for our Works ſake,
much leſs on our Children for our Works ſake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That in</hi> Heb. 11. 29. By Faith they paſſed through
the Red Sea, as by dry Land.</p>
                  <p>Is there any mention of the Imputation of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:150284:53"/>
Faith to their Children? Or, is there any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of ſuch an Inference?</p>
                  <p>Is it ſaid, all the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſed by Faith?
Is this indefinite Propoſition equal to an univerſal?
Would not the Propoſition be true if only a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of them were Believers? Among all that Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
are they ſure there were no Orphans that were
uncapable of actual Faith? Whoſe Faith then was
imputed to them? There went up alſo a mixt Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
had they all the Faith of Miracles, and was
their Faith imputed to their Infants?</p>
                  <p>I appeal to all indifferent Men, whether this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putative
Faith by them feigned, be not an unheared-of
Novelty.</p>
                  <p>But what can they mean, but that God did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the Infants Believers for their Parents Faith?
Well, many of theſe Parents ſoon forgot his Works,
became Unbelievers, and conſequently the Parents In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
muſt be imputed to the Children, and then
they muſt be rejected of God. What Stuff is this?
at one time accepted, and at another time falling
from this Grace and rejected.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the truth is, that none are accounted
Believers by God but thoſe who are truly ſuch; and
thoſe that went through the Red Sea by Faith, were
truly Saints, the Text ſaith they were the Children
of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> it ſaith not that all of them paſſed by Faith,
even the ſix hundred thouſand Men which theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
mention. And they know that an indefinite
Propoſition is not always equal to an univerſal, nor
is not true in this place.</p>
                  <p>All to whom Faith was attributed in the <hi>11th</hi> of
<hi>Hebrews</hi> were true Saints: All the natural Seed of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> were not true Saints; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Faith is not there
attributed to the natural Seed.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay they, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Infants were baptized
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:150284:53"/>
in the Cloud, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2. and this was a Type
of Goſpel-Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Church was alſo typical of
the Goſpel-Church. And if the whole Church were
baptized, what doth it teach but that all Goſpel-Churches
ought to be baptized? But Goſpel-Churches
are made up of Believers, viſible Saints, and not of
Infants; therefore this infers not Infant-Baptiſm, not
ſo much as by a legitimate Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>But (ſay they) Infants are capable of Baptiſm, the
Subject therein is paſſive.</p>
                  <p>The unbelieving Adult are capable of Baptiſm for
the ſame reaſon, the Subject therein being paſſive. Will
theſe Gentlemen then baptize promiſcuouſly all Adult
Perſons not before baptized (as they phraſe it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are capable? How frivolous is this? Their
Reaſon lies thus. Every Subject capable of Baptiſm
ought to be baptized: Every Infant is capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm:
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let them now go and baptize the Infants of <hi>Jews,
Turks, Heathens,</hi> and then boaſt they have made ſo
many Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag. 10. line</hi> 13. But neither this nor any one Word
of God doth ſhew that Infants muſt be denied Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
becauſe they cannot do what is required of
Adult Perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a miſtake: For not only this but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
other Scripture that ſhews what is required of a
Perſon in order to his Baptiſm, doth ſhew that all
thoſe are to be denied Baptiſm in whom thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites
are not found. And I reaſon thus:</p>
                  <p>If the Scripture hath no where authorized the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to baptize any, but thoſe who profeſſing their
Faith in Chriſt do claim Baptiſm, then they ought
not to baptize Infants: but the former is true; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
Or thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:150284:54"/>
If the Scripture excludes all from Baptiſm who do
not profeſs Faith in Chriſt, then it excludes Infants:
but the former is true; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Aſſumption is prov'd by this Text under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
<hi>Acts 8. 37. If thou believeſt with all thy
Heart, thou mayſt,</hi> &amp;c. not elſe. No inſtance can be
given of one baptized who did not profeſs Faith.</p>
                  <p>And to affirm the Scripture allows the Baptiſm of
ſuch, for whoſe Baptiſm there is to be found in the
Scripture neither Precept nor Precedent, is only to
affirm, and not to prove.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe Gentlemen prove when they write next,
that there is an Indulgence given to Infants in reſpect
of their receiving Baptiſm if they can? Otherwiſe to
talk of one thing required of Infants, and another of
the Adult, is altogether vain.</p>
                  <p>If the Scripture does not, with reſpect of Baptiſm,
make a diſtinction between Infants and Adult, then
the Miniſter ought not. And ſuch diſtinctions as
the Scripture is not acquainted with, are deviſed by
ſhifting heads to deceive themſelves and others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Line</hi> 28. I ſhall quickly ſhew that the Scripture
doth authorize the practice of Infant Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Bravely and confidently aſſerted!</p>
                  <p>But here is a grant, that the Scripture doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
tell us that the Apoſtles did baptize Infants.</p>
                  <p>But this Argument will fall on your ſelves. The

Baptiſm to any Chriſtian's Infant; or adminiſter
it to any Adult Perſon deſcending from a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture doth not tell us that any
Chriſtian Parent did ever offer his Infant Seed to
Baptiſm; how ſhould it then tell us ſuch were deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it?</p>
                  <p>It is not lawful for us to do in inſtituted Worſhip,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150284:54"/>
any thing but what is commanded; otherwiſe you
may introduce with the Papiſts, the Croſs, Oil, Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and Cream, into the Ordinance of Baptiſm, yea, and
a thouſand other Fopperies, and ſay, the Scripture
doth not tell us the Apoſtles did not uſe theſe. And
a Papiſt would uterly rout you, if you durſt abide by
this Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page 11. line</hi> 1. But we have ſome probable Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of baptizing Infants.</p>
                  <p>Even now they would quickly ſhew, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth authorize the Practice of Infant Baptiſm;
but now their Confidence is turned into probable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Acts 16. 33. <hi>He and all his were baptized
ſtraightway.</hi> Here I warrant it is probable there were
Children: But is it not as probable that there were
none? I mean, Infants; and the reaſon is, he might
be old, and his Children grown up, and might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of hearing and believing; and that it was ſo,
conſult the Text, <hi>And they ſpake unto him the Word of
the Lord, and to all that were in his Houſe.</hi> Did they
ſpeak to Infants?</p>
                  <p>But this no more ſuppoſeth (ſay they) that the
Word was preached to all, even Infants, than thoſe
words, <hi>Mark 16. 15. Go preach the Goſpel to every
Creature,</hi> ſuppoſes Stones able to hear, <hi>&amp;c. All</hi> in
one place, and <hi>every</hi> in the other is to be underſtood
with limitation according to the capacity of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>Firſt here, as I hinted, it may be ſuppoſed that the
Jaylor was old, and his Children were capable of
hearing and believing; and is it not as probable (and
much more, becauſe the Word was preach'd to them)
than that they were Infants?</p>
                  <p>But it may be doubtful whether he had any Children
at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:150284:55"/>
(2.) This <hi>All,</hi> ſaith he, to whom the Apoſtle preach'd
is to be reſtrain'd, according to the capacity of the
Subject.</p>
                  <p>And muſt not that <hi>all</hi> be ſo reſtrained, where it is
ſaid, <hi>he was baptized and all his ſtraightway?</hi> May we
not ſay by all Infants, they are no more included than
where 'tis ſaid, <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi>
Stones and Trees are included?</p>
                  <p>Infants are no more capable of Baptiſm, according
as it was inſtituted by Chriſt, and practiſed by the
Apoſtles, where learning Chriſt and believing do ever
precede it, than Stones and Trees of hearing the
Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>And to ſay as they, ſome were preached to as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in their Parents, is meer unintelligible ſtuff.</p>
                  <p>If ſome believed in their Parents, others did reject
and perſecute the Goſpel in their Parents with as good
reaſon; and ſo dying in Infancy every Infant muſt be
accountable for, and damned for the Sins of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
and unbelieving Parents; and ſo not only
<hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt, but all his Sins, yea all the Sins of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Progenitors will be charged on their dying
Infants. This follows with as good Conſequence as
that the Word is preached to ſome in their Parents,
and their Parents Faith imputed to them; and is
ſuch unreaſonable, abſurd and unmerciful Doctrine in
reſpect of poor Children, that the like I am perſwaded
was hardly ever heard of before.</p>
                  <p>When you can ſhew that theſe are as plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the word <hi>Baptize,</hi> as Infants are in the
word <hi>Nations,</hi> we ſhall further conſider what you ſay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Infants are not at all included in the
word <hi>Nations</hi> in the Commiſſion is manifeſt, becauſe
there is meant no more of all Nations than are taught
or diſcipled; and, as before is noted, to take <hi>Nations</hi>
in the largeſt extent, then even the Unconverted and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:150284:55"/>
their Children alſo ought to be baptized according to
the Commiſſion; which being abſurd, it muſt follow,
that only ſuch of all Nations as are diſcipled by the
Miniſtry are to be baptized. Now pray let us hear,
according to your promiſe, why you do not uſe Salt,
Cream, Oil and Spittle, ſeeing they are not prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

be baptized, that are not expreſly or conſequentially
excluded by the Word of God; therefore the Infants
of profeſſing Chriſtians ought to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>minor</hi> here is to be ſupplied. But the Infants
of profeſſing Chriſtians are not expreſly or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially
excluded by the Word of God. This I
deny.</p>
                  <p>And this they might well have ſuppoſed would
have been denied, which yet they have not proved,
but have turned off the Opponency upon their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
as ſoon as ever they pretend to take it on
them; and ſay we have not been ever able to prove
Infants excluded from Baptiſm by the Word, which
was done by the very Argument they pretend to
anſwer. For,</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt hath nowhere required his Miniſters to
baptize Infants, then conſequentially he hath excluded
them from Baptiſm; but the former is true, and theſe
Gentlemen will never be able to ſhew a Command of
Chriſt for baptizing of them. For,</p>
                  <p>None ought to baptize any, for baptizing whom
he hath no poſitive Command: for in inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

than commanded. <hi>Moſes</hi> would not ſay, the Lord
commanded 50 Loops to a Curtain, but he did not
command I ſhould ſet no more, I will therefore put
55; he well knew that being commanded to put 50,
more or leſs than that was conſequentially forbidden:
So when our Lord commands to baptize ſuch of the
Nations as ſhould be diſcipled by the Word, theſe
Gentlemen might ſee that thoſe words reſtrain their
Commiſſion, and that they ought to account all others
excluded from their Commiſſion, but ſuch as were
diſcipled by the Word.</p>

                  <p>The Inſtitution for the Paſſover doth not expreſs
the Cup, which yet was piouſly uſed by Chriſt himſelf.</p>

know that it was uſed as part of that Ordinance?
I ſpeak of the Cup our Lord took for his Supper. I
do read in <hi>Luke</hi> the Cup was took after Supper, that
is, after the Paſſover was ended; and that it was a
part of the Paſſover, if they have it not from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
how do they know it?</p>
                  <p>But what if this that they ſay ſhould obtain, that
all things pertaining to an Ordinance need not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Inſtitution? I hope if ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
be not expreſſed, yet they will grant that the
principal things muſt: And the Subject in Baptiſm is a
principal thing, otherwiſe let them go by that Rule,
and baptize Infidels and their Children.</p>

But they cannot yet prove even by Conſequence
that any Infants ought to be baptized: for by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
words they ſhall prove in this Commiſſion
that Believers Infants are to be baptized, only chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

viſible, therefore they ought to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>That Church-memberſhip was a ground of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
was denied in the Diſpute.</p>
                  <p>And alſo that ſome Infants were viſible Church-Members.</p>
                  <p>That Infants, <hi>viz.</hi> Elect Infants, are Members of
the Univerſal Church I grant, becauſe redeemed by
Chriſt, are ſanctified, and ſhall be ſaved; but who
theſe are we know not, it comes not into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
Obſervation: And God doth not require Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities
of his Servants. God hath not made
Election, or Redemption, or habitual Grace the

are ſecret things, and cannot come into his Obſervation
without a Miracle.</p>
                  <p>They ſay here, the Infants of Believers are Church-Members
before Baptiſm; this we deny if they ſpeak
of an inſtituted Church, and they are not able to
make it good: That Text <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38. here quoted,
ſpeaks of a National Church, not a Goſpel-Church,
which is Congregational, and conſiſts of profeſſed Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>

                  <p>Here they grant that Members of the Jewiſh
Church, without credible Profeſſion of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
were not to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>But the Jewiſh Church at that time was the only
viſible Church, therefore the Point is gain'd, that
viſible Church-Memberſhip gives no right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:150284:57"/>
if it did not then, much leſs doth it now.</p>

                     <hi>I prove they are,</hi> Suffer little Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for

                  <p>The Diſpute here is, Whether by Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
be meant the Church, or Kingdom of Glory?
If I ſuppoſe the former, what advantage will they
get? <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, for of ſuch,
i. e.</hi> like theſe in Humility and Meekneſs is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Church.
<hi>I ſay unto you, whoſoever humbles not
himſelf as a little Child, ſhall not enter therein.</hi> What
is this to the Baptiſm of Infants? Nay, ſhould you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
thus, that the Church redeemed by Chriſt
hath ſome ſuch as theſe, what is this to Baptiſm?
Who denies theſe things? But where is the good
Conſequence to prove from hence Infant-Baptiſm?</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, I am apt to think that Chriſt
tells them that ſuch as theſe are received to Glory;
theſe Gentlemen ſay this cannot be, becauſe every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
that goes to Heaven drops his Infancy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
perfect into Glory.</p>
                  <p>I demand here, whether it is impoſſible for God
to bring an Infant to Glory?</p>
                  <p>Wherein lies the Contradiction?</p>
                  <p>How will theſe Gentlemen define an Infant? will
they tell us it is a Creature rational, but not capable
of uſing Reaſon? ſuch may be an Ideot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
agrees not to an Infant only: For my part I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell how to define an Infant ſo as to make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a Contradiction that it ſhould be ſuch in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Let's hear how they define an Infant, even a
poor little weak thing, <hi>pag. 34. line</hi> 4. of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>Well then, how do theſe Gentlemen know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heaven there be ſuch little Creatures as Infants?
Cannot God make the Soul in thoſe little weak Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
act as gloriouſly as in the Organs of a Giant?
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150284:57"/>
Will theſe Gentlemen affirm that bodily Strength is
one of the Bleſſings of Heaven? Are they ſure there
will be need of it? For my part I have been ready to
think much, if not the whole of the Glory of the
Saints above conſiſted in the rectitude of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
and Wills.</p>
                  <p>But as I ſaid, if we ſhould grant theſe Gentlemen
their longing, and ſuppoſe that by the Kingdom of
Heaven was meant the Church, where is the good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
to prove that they muſt be baptized? I have
long waited for one, but ſtill they delay me.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 14. that the Members of a Chriſtian
Church have a right to Baptiſm: But I deſpair to find
where they ſo proved it, and I do not think any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Judg will give it to them, that Church-Memberſhip
gives a right to Baptiſm, for the reaſons
before offered againſt this Opinion.</p>
                  <p>It was not ſo in the Jewiſh Church, much leſs in

may be Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men.</p>
                  <p>How weakly this was done, let the Reader judg:
And we have not ſaid that Infants are uncapable of
being made holy, or ſo uncapable as the Beaſts of the
Field are; for they have the Seeds of Reaſon, may
be juſtified, ſanctified and glorified. God can do all
this to them we ſay, tho you will not allow Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to Infants. But we ſay Men can no more teach
them, and by teaching them make them Diſciples,
than they can teach the Beaſts of the Field.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The Infants of Believers are called Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>Acts 15. 10. Why tempt ye God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I grant ſome Perſons here are called Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but deny that Infants are ſo called, as is manifeſt
from the Anſwer, <hi>pag. 15. line</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>They are here up again with being taught in their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:150284:58"/>
Parents, ſo may as well be ſaid to be baptized in their
Parents for any thing they have urged to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
but ſomething muſt be ſaid leſt their mouths
ſhould ſeem ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>2. They deny that all who are here called Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are called Brethren, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. or are ſaid to be
taught. This is but a bold denial, the Text is plain,
none are intended in this place but the Brethren
whom the falſe Apoſtles taught; the falſe Apoſtles
did not preach to their Infants, if they had any
ſuch. And <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifieth of the Brethren, that God
had purified their Hearts by Faith, and theſe he calls
Diſciples, and not Children, who could not have
their Hearts purified by Faith: And tho it was the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of <hi>Ceſarea</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi>'s words relate to, yet the
caſe of both, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe at <hi>Antioch</hi> and theſe, muſt be
parallel, or <hi>Peter</hi>'s words had not been pertinent.</p>
                  <p>But ſay theſe Gentlemen, cannot God give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
the Seed of Faith, and purify their Hearts by
ſo doing? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ridiculous enough! do theſe Gentlemen believe real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that to be the ſenſe of the place? Do they think
that <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid this from Revelation? Dare they tell
the World ſuch ſtuff to bolſter up a tottering Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
Is there ſo much as a probability for ſuch a
thing, or any good Conſequences? It is manifeſt <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was ſpeaking of the Brethren, to whom the falſe
Teachers came; for he parallels the caſe of the
Brethren at <hi>Antioch</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Holy Ghoſt, and Faith, and a purified
Heart by his Miniſtry, and if theſe were not Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
then neither thoſe at <hi>Antioch:</hi> and here is a
good Conſequence; for otherwiſe his Inſtance in them
had not been pertinent, which is very abſurd to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
                  <p>The Heart indeed by infuſion of holy Habits may
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:150284:58"/>
be ſaid to be purified, but that could not come into
the obſervation even of <hi>Peter</hi> without a Miracle,
and here is no need to feign one; I ſay feign one,
becauſe here is no rational ground of ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture:
<hi>ver.</hi> 7. ſaith <hi>Peter, God made choice among
us, that the</hi> Gentiles <hi>by my mouth ſhould hear
the word of the Goſpel, and believe.</hi> I ask now
thoſe reverend Gentlemen, the Authors of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue,
whether thoſe that heard the word from
his mouth were Infants? did Infants hear the word
of the Goſpel and believe? Theſe are the very Perſons
of whom he teſtifieth in the <hi>8th verſ.</hi> That <hi>God gave
them the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> it is to be underſtood the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt: and <hi>ver.</hi> 9. tis ſaid,
<hi>He purified their hearts by Faith;</hi> 'tis the ſame perſons
ſtill; and yet theſe Gentlemen feign, that they might
be Infants, ſaying, <hi>And cannot God give Infants the
ſeed of Faith, and purify their hearts by ſo doing?</hi>
Yes indeed he can, but 'twas not done here; and this
they knew well enough, if they examined the place,
which I perceive they did by their next words: for
they ſay they were the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Caeſarea;</hi> and then
how diſingenuous is it for them to put ſuch a blind
upon their Readers, to cheat them out of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings?</p>
                  <p>And I wonder what theſe Gentlemen hope to gain
to their Cauſe, by telling us that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake here of
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> not thoſe at <hi>Antioch.</hi> This
we grant; but how weak was their Anſwer, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſuppoſe them Children.</p>
                  <p>But I ſay, if it were not a parallel Caſe between
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and the Brethren at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
to what purpoſe did <hi>Peter</hi> declare the Hiſtory of
their Converſion?</p>
                  <p>And that it was ſo, I prove from the <hi>5th verſe</hi> of
this ſame <hi>chap.</hi> compared with the firſt.</p>
                  <p>

In the firſt <hi>verſe</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>Certain men came down
from</hi> Judea, <hi>and taught the Brethren, Except ye be
circumciſed, &amp;c.</hi> not ye and your Children, but
your ſelves. Thence I conclude that theſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
were men capable of hearing the word, and
not Infants. And in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. certain of the Sect
of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> which believed, ſaid, <hi>It was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to circumciſe them, and to command them to
keep the Law:</hi> but Infants were not capable of ſuch a
Command; therefore the Brethren intended in both
places are Believers, and not Infants. As to the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
about the manner which they make, this I
ſay, it only ſhews that theſe falſe Teachers would have
the Brethren that they taught to have the Foreskin
cut off, and it cannot poſſibly have relation to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
they being not intended by the falſe Teachers,
or <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other in this place, as I think
I have ſufficiently demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p>We ſay Circumciſion cannot be the yoke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Infants did bear it, and becauſe it bound to
keep the whole Law. To the firſt they anſwer, that
it only ſignifieth a burdenſome Yoke. Suppoſe ſo,
this Yoke was to be laid on proſelyted <hi>Gentiles</hi> when
adult; and of theſe the diſpute is, and not of Infants
at all. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If you be circumciſed,
Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing; verily I ſay unto every
one of you that is circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to the
whole Law:</hi> this was not ſpoke to Children but to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid well, <hi>after the manner
of Moſes</hi> relates to the Form, not to the Subject.</p>
                  <p>What if the Yoke would have been laid on Infants,
had the falſe Teachers obtained the point againſt the
Brethren. Yet it proves not in the leaſt the preſent
Diſpute was about any other than thoſe that believed,
as is manifeſt fully from what hath been before ſaid,
and therefore Infants are not called Diſciples in this
place.</p>

from Believers as ſuch, but from their lawful
Marriage; for the ſcruple was, whether the Believer
being married to an Unbeliever might live together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Ezra</hi> commanded idolatrous Wives and Children
to be put away. The Apoſtle ſaith, they may dwell
together, and that if the Unbeliever pleaſeth to dwell
with the Believer, that then the Believer ſhould not
put her or him away, for theſe reaſons, becauſe the
Unbelieving is ſanctified by the Believing, elſe were
their Children unclean, but now are holy, <hi>viz.</hi> a
holy Seed by a legitimate Holineſs.</p>

                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:150284:60"/>
And we may obſerve the holineſs of the Seed is of
the ſame nature with the holineſs of the Unbeliever,
who is ſaid here to be ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>There is no external relative foederal Holineſs of
Perſons or Things in Goſpel-times. Theſe being but
ceremonial and typical, are now done away.</p>
                  <p>The unbelieving Husband is now ſanctified to or
by the Wife, that is, ſanctified for uſe. 'Tis not
Whoredom, 'tis not ſin; elſe if it were, your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were unclean, they would be Baſtards. So ſaith
the Scripture, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. And did he make one,
(<hi>i. e.</hi> one Wife) yet he had the reſidue of the Spirit;
and wherefore one? that he might ſeek a godly Seed,
a Seed according to God's Ordinance of Matrimony.</p>
                  <p>Not only the Seed of the Faithful, but of Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
alſo, is holy in this reſpect. Marriage is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in all, and the Bed undefiled. And had the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
made their Marriage void, their Children would
have been Baſtards, and the Marriage-bed a defiled
one. For ſuch as is the Sanctification or Holineſs of
the unbelieving Wife or Husband, ſuch is the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Child: but by the former only can
be underſtood a matrimonial Sanctification, therefore

                     <hi>But what think theſe Gentlemen of</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4. 3,
4, 5. For this is the Will of God, even your ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that ye ſhould abſtain from Fornication; that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſs his Veſſel in ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) If Legitimacy were meant, the Apoſtle would
ſpeak falſe: that is, if theſe Gentlemen ſpeak true,
the words would run thus, ſay they, If the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Wife be not ſanctified by the believing Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
your Children would be Baſtards. True, if
God's Ordinance of Matrimony did not ſanctify them
to a holy uſe of each other; but it doth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is a ſilly Suppoſition, and they had this, while
both were Unbelievers, and the Converſion of either
doth not diſſolve the Marriage-bond.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it's moſt probable that the Apoſtle ſpeaks
of the Children they had, while both were unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
becauſe we may juſtly infer, that the Queſtion
was put as ſoon as one was converted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page 23. line</hi> 6. When you can ſhew that Bells
were once Church-members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Queſtion is,
whether Holineſs be a ground of Baptiſm, not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Church-memberſhip be. The Anſwer is, <hi>No,</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or this reaſon. If Holineſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> relative Holineſs, be
a ground of Baptiſm, then Horſes Bells muſt be
baptized; for they are ſaid to be holy, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 20.</p>
                  <p>But Horſes Bells muſt not be baptized; therefore
a relative Holineſs is not the ground of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The Promiſe is to you and to your Children.
This Promiſe the Infants of penitent Perſons have a
right to, therefore they have a right to Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>By the Promiſe is meant either Chriſt and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion
by him, or the offer of Chriſt and Salvation by
him.</p>
                  <p>If the former, then all the Infants of penitent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ons
have a right to Chriſt and Salvation, and not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:150284:61"/>
one born of Chriſtian Parents can ever periſh, except we
hold falling from Grace, which I ſuppoſe theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
do not. If by the Promiſe be underſtood
the latter, the ſenſe is this: The offer of Chriſt and
Salvation is to you, and to your Children, and to
all afar off, among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom the Lord
ſhall outwardly call: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trum horum mavis accipe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay farther, theſe words were ſpoken to Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and Impenitent; and no Argument for Infant-Baptiſm
can be drawn from a Promiſe made to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers.</p>
                  <p>Methinks the ſenſe of the words then ſhould be
this: That the Apoſtle ſpake to the Children of God,
to the Elect among theſe, tho it's like he knew not
who they were. Yet ſuch he knew God would call,
and therefore caſts forth his Net, and leaves God to
gather the Fiſhes together.</p>
                  <p>And to theſe Elect he cries, the Promiſe was to
them, and to their Seed, and to all other Elect afar
off, whom it ſhould pleaſe God effectually to call.</p>
                  <p>And that thus this place ſhould be underſtood, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
becauſe God's Promiſes are certain and ſure,
and cannot fail of their end. Had God promiſed Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Chriſt to all theſe, they ſhould have certainly
had it; had God promiſed it to their natural Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
they alſo ſhould have had it. But to ſome
God had promiſed it, even the Elect among theſe,
and their Seed, alſo the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who are ſaid to be afar
off, whom God would call: to none of theſe did or
could the Promiſe ever fail, becauſe of the faithfulneſs
and power of God, by which he is able and willing
to perform all his word.</p>
                  <p>And tho the Apoſtle calls on thoſe that believed and
repented, by which their Election did appear, to be
baptized; yet here is not a reward of their Infants
that they ſhould be baptized alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:150284:62"/>
And tho theſe Gentlemen ſay that the Apoſtle here
ſpake impertinently, if he did not intend their Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed;
yet it appears otherwiſe, and that the Apoſtle
would inform them that God had a People as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, ſo among their Children, and among
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> afar off, whom he would call.</p>
                  <p>Let us hear the Paraphraſe of theſe Gentlemen;
You grown <hi>Jews</hi> and ye <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when called, have
a right to Church-Privileges, but your poor Infants,
who for many hundred years paſt have enjoyed the
ſame (whoſe Infants do they mean here? thoſe of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo? had they for many hundred years en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
Church-Privileges? ſure Gentlemen you are here
miſtaken) are now through the gracious efficacy of
Chriſt's Death ſtript of it. Well Gentlemen, what
are the Infants of the called <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſtript
of? ſure only Shadows, the heavy Yoak of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
which a painful Ordinance obliged them
to; they injoy all the profitable and good things that
the Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> enjoy'd; they have Godly
Prayers for them, holy Examples ſet before them;
the Oracles of God in a clearer light than ever the
Jewiſh Infants did enjoy: when they are called, they
have clearer views of God, Chriſt, Heaven, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
than the other could have; and in all things
wherein the Goſpel excels the Law, the Elect Infants
among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as they grow up and are called,
have a more preferable Diſpenſation. And why, Ah
poor hearts! they never did the leaſt to forfeit it!
What Sirs! do we ſay any real good is taken from
them? prove it if you can. What advantage have
your Children by their Baptiſm, as you call it, and
feigned Church-memberſhip, above ours? ſuppoſing
the Parents of both equally holy. Surely this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
yours have, that they often think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſafe when they are not, and at beſt they loſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:150284:62"/>
the benefit of Chriſt's Ordinance, and many times go
with a doubting Conſcience about it all their days.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Sir, you may enjoy your Rhetorick, but
for any thing argumentative therein, you had as good
let it alone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag. 25. line</hi> 3. We have another of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Arguments, God did not caſt out thoſe Infants in
Judgment or Mercy to them.</p>
                  <p>Yes, Sir, in Mercy he hath taken away the bitter
and left the ſweet, yea he hath given better Sweets
than the other enjoy'd. I ſpeak of the Elect among
both; as for the other nothing is really good to them,
therefore they can loſe no good.</p>
                  <p>I have above ſuggeſted, what greater Good elect
Children enjoy now, than the Elect then; and ſo
there is a fair end of this Argument.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Not one Privilege of the Covenant of Grace
was ever taken away by the Death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>'Tis granted; but that external Privilege of Infants
Church-Memberſhip is no Privilege of the Covenant
of Grace. The Jewiſh Nation, as ſuch, were not
under the Covenant of Grace: If you think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
pray reply to Mr. <hi>Keach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for what you ſay, that the Jewiſh Infants had
a viſible right to the Covenant of Grace:</p>
                  <p>If ſome, then all of them, how wicked ſoever their
immediate Parents were, and how viſible ſoever their
Wickedneſs, Unbelief, and Impenitency was; pray
will you conſider this, and tell me what right the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
of a flagitious ungodly Profeſſor hath to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
by your Principles, and yet how by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you can deny to baptize ſuch, ſeeing they could
not refuſe to circumciſe ſuch, and Baptiſm is a Privilege
of the Covenant of Grace, but of Children you cannot
determin who are in Covenant. You ſay they had a
viſible right. I ask, had they viſibly a right to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:150284:63"/>
Bleſſings of the Covenant? What! and enjoy none of
them, neither Election, Adoption, Juſtification, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or Glorification. Surely their right in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
could not be very viſible, when there was none
at all, which was the caſe of an infinite number of theſe
viſible Members. Do you not read, <hi>all are not</hi> Iſrael,
<hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael; nor becauſe they are the Seed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> are they all Children; thoſe that are the
Children of the Fleſh, are not therefore the Children
of God, but the Children of the Promiſe are accounted
the Seed. 'Tis, Gentlemen, the Elect that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Covenant of Grace, and the Intereſt of
theſe in that Covenant is not, nor ever was viſible till
their Converſion, except a ſpecial Revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them intervene.</p>
                  <p>To talk that any are viſible Members of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace before their Converſion to God is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is not a true but monſtrous kind of Charity, that
the Scripture no where hath taught.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. The Infants of Gentile Converts are not
kept out, becauſe Jews and Gentiles have the ſame
Privileges in Chriſt; that is, thoſe who are really in
Chriſt: but this makes not for their purpoſe, for not
the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the <hi>Jews,</hi> as ſuch, were
really in Chriſt; not becauſe they are the Seed of
<hi>Abraham</hi> are they all Children, ſaith the Scripture:
And may not I ſay, not becauſe they are the Seed of
the Saints, are they all the Children of God. How
are theſe viſibly then the Children of God?</p>
                  <p>I often find theſe Gentlemen calling their Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Diſputation, their impartial
Account, wherein they are the Trumpeters of their
own Praiſe.</p>
                  <p>But to any indifferent Reader their Impartiality
will ſeem queſtionable; and I would have them think
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat to honour themſelves is nothing worth.</p>

                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:150284:63"/>
As to their boaſting that they have proved the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of Believers holy Perſons, Church-Members,
Diſciples, and this in a Scripture-ſenſe, is but a vain
Boaſt. Theſe being the things in Controverſy, ſhould
have been left to the judgment of the Reader, and
their Modeſty then would have been praiſed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
ſo great Preſumption on ſuch ſmall grounds ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
great Conceitedneſs and Value of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And methinks I cannot but take notice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of theſe Gentlemen; they never think they have
fully defended themſelves, elſe why comes out this
Dialogue? and yet their Cauſe is not one whit bettered,
but their Weakneſs more manifeſt: For now we ſee
the ſtrength of all their Wit, ſure nothing more can
be expected from them, I mean nothing ſtronger; for
this is midwiv'd into the World with the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and moſt mature Deliberation, and as a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of their former Faults.</p>
                  <p>The People could not but expect ſome ſtrange Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
after ſo many Eſſays from theſe Mountains;
but their Expectation is at laſt deluded, and behold
a ridiculous Mouſe, the Matter of their Scorn and
Laughter.</p>

                  <head>Mr. William's LETTER to Mr. Leigh,
written after the Diſputation.</head>
                  <p>BRother <hi>Leigh,</hi> for ſo I can heartily call you, and
own you if you pleaſe to accept of it: the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of writing theſe few Lines to you is this. I
have in my reflex Thoughts weighed what was offered upon
both ſides in the Diſpute; not being willing to abide by
any thing that has not a foundation in the Word, nor to
reject any thing that is offered againſt my preſent Opinion,
could I ſee it were bottomed on the Word, becauſe I know
I muſt one day be judged by the Word. You told me you
could have ſaid four times more for our Cauſe than was
ſpoken by us, and ten times more than you did for your
own. Poſſibly you might have ſpoken four times as many
words as we did: but I think it would have been a hard
task to have offered Arguments that had four times more
weight and ſubſtance than thoſe had that were offered
by us; I mean for clearing the Point of the Subject ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Commiſſion which the firſt Preliminaries
bound us to: yet I would not undervalue your Abilities,
nor ſet our own in competition with yours: had we not had
Truth on our ſide, your Abilities would ſoon have overturn'd
mine. The <hi>Doctor,</hi> I think, might be able to cope with
any of you in that reſpect: but if you can offer four times
more for our Cauſe than we did, I wonder your own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhould not be convincing to you, tho ours were not;
and could we have that fourfold Strength added to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
I believe you would not be able to anſwer one of
them. For ſo weak as our Arguments were, you did no
otherwiſe anſwer them but by denying a part, which is an
eaſy way of anſwering the ſtrongeſt Argument that can be
offered: and if you could have offered ten times more for
your own Cauſe, why had you not done it? you might have
had the Opponency ſoon turn'd upon you, when the <hi>Doctor</hi>
gave you an Argument containing an univerſal Negative;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:150284:65"/>
and, as I do ſince underſtand, you ought to have accepted it,
according to the Rules of Diſputation in the Univerſity, from
whence you take theſe Rules: I am informed that a univerſal
Negative is taken for a Maxim. I thought that artificial Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
had been the Improvement of natural Reaſon; but if
this be a Rule to be obſerv'd in it, that the Opponent muſt
prove an univerſal Negative, I know nothing that is more
contrary to natural Reaſon: had there been either Precept
or Precedent for Infant-Baptiſm on Record, then it had been
poſſible for you or ſome body elſe to have produced it; and
had you done it, his Argument had been gone, and you had
gained the Cauſe: but it is impoſſible for a Man to prove,
that neither you nor any one elſe can produce ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
otherwiſe than to deny that there is any ſuch Record
to be produc'd. If this be according to the Rule of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
I look on it as an effectual way to keep People in
ignorance. I ſuppoſe, that if you could have produc'd a
Record either of Precept or Precedent for Infant-Baptiſm,
you would not be tied ſo cloſe to the Rule of Diſputation,
as not to have brought it to light.</p>
                  <p>Whatever you could have ſaid, I know not; you know you
did not give us an inſtance for Infant-Baptiſm, tho it was
often deſired, and that with great Importunity: and muſt
we ſtill look on Infant-Baptiſm to be an Ordinance of God,
a part of Divine Worſhip, that hath neither Precept nor
Precedent for its Practice? But, Sir, if you can ſay ten times
more for your Practice than you did, it is not too late to
offer it yet; and if you pleaſe to ſend it me, and it be
ſuch as is convincing, I will ſpread it for you; if not, I
will fairly anſwer it, and not publickly ſpread it. Sir,
when I conſider what was offered by us, and denied by you,
and with what Props your own Arguments were ſupported,
being Men of ſuch Parts and Piety as you are, on whoſe
Credit the Ordinance of Chriſt is like to be adminiſtred to
a wrong Subject for the future, as it hath been for Ages
paſt upon a like traditional Bottom; I am really grieved,
and that is the reaſon of my ſetting Pen to Paper:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when I conſider what was offered by us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by you. I can repeat my own Arguments better than
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:150284:66"/>
I can the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s, and therefore I ſhall confine my ſelf to
them: You know you preſt us to allow of Conſequences
rightly drawn from the Word; the <hi>Doctor</hi> told you you ſhould
give it which way you could: but did you not deny almoſt,
if not all the Conſequences that were offered by me to prove
that Infants were not the Subjects of Baptiſm, according to
the Commiſſion? A Negative Task that we were put upon,
which could no otherwiſe be proved but by Conſequences.
To repeat ſome of my Arguments, and I need repeat but
the <hi>major</hi> for the moſt part. My firſt Argument was this,
That if Believers are the only Subjects of Baptiſm accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Commiſſion, then Infants are not. Here you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the Sequel; but if the Antecedent be true, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is true, and rightly drawn from the Text.</p>
                  <p>There being none put into the Commiſſion as the Subjects
of Baptiſm but Believers, <hi>Mark</hi> the <hi>16th,</hi> and <hi>17th,</hi> you
did not deny the Antecedent, how then could you deny the
Conſequent? My ſecond Argument was this, That if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
are incapable of believing, then they are not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Baptiſm, according to the Commiſſion; but they
are ſo. Here you denied the <hi>minor,</hi> which I wonder at,
that you ſhould be of the Judgment that Infants are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of believing; yea, your denying the <hi>minor</hi> ſpeaks as
much. My third Argument was, If the Eſſence of Faith
conſiſts in the Act of the Underſtanding and of the Will,
then Infants are incapable of believing. Here you denied
the Sequel; you did not deny but that the Eſſence of Faith
conſiſts in the Act of the Underſtanding and of the Will,
and if you had, it would have been proved; but how could
you deny the Sequel?</p>
                  <p>Are Infants capable of apprehending Chriſt in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and in his Offices, for ſo he muſt be apprehended as
the Object of Faith? Are Infants capable of conſenting
Chriſt to be theirs, and they Chriſt's in all his Offices, which
is the Act of the Will that follows the Act of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding?
Can Infants make a Reſignation of themſelves to
Chriſt to be taught by him, and ſaved by him, and ruled
and governed by him? Can you prove by the Word, that
there is ſuch a Capacity in Infants, or that there is ſuch a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:150284:66"/>
Capacity in the Children of Believers, conſidered as ſuch
and not in the Children of Unbelievers? My fourth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was, That if none could believe on Jeſus Chriſt, that
never heard of Jeſus Chriſt, then Infants are incapable of
believing. Here again you denied the Sequel. You know
there are Scriptures enough to prove the Antecedent in
every Propoſition, and the Conſequent was rightly drawn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
ſo that you had no more ground to deny the Conſequent
than you had to deny the Antecedent, yet you denied them
all: and thus you might have run me up <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> by
a continual denying, without rendring any reaſon for
what you did, or diſcovering any Fallacy in any one of my
Arguments. The Arguments you offered your ſelf are
judged by ſome to have little weight in them, and that by
Pedo-baptiſts as well as others: Your firſt was, That if Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are Church-Members, then they have a right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
the initiating Ordinance; but they are ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
<hi>minor</hi> being denied, you brought <hi>Mat. 19. Of ſuch is the
Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> You indeavour'd to prove, that by the
Kingdom of Heaven was meant the Viſible Church: I denied
it, and offered an Argument to the contrary; That if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
were not Members of a particular inſtituted Church,
nor of the univerſal viſible Church, out of which a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
inſtituted Church was gathered; then they were not
viſible Church-Members: but they are not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You told me it did not belong to the Reſpondent to form
an Argument, that was all you replied to it; then I denied
your <hi>major,</hi> that Church-Memberſhip was the ground of
Baptiſm: I brought <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. and <hi>Luke</hi> 3. and ſhow'd you,
that thoſe that came to <hi>John</hi> to be baptized and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
were Church-Members; you replied that they were
Church-Members <hi>de facto,</hi> but not <hi>de jure.</hi> I ask'd you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you did own them Church-Members <hi>de facto?</hi> you ſaid
you did: Then ſaid I, Church-Memberſhip is not the ground
of Baptiſm; you ſaid again, they were not Church-Members
<hi>de jure,</hi> for by the Law they ought to have been caſt out: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
you to produce that Law, but you could not do it. And
now, Sir, I would offer you two things which were not then
mentioned. Firſt, Suppoſe a Grant, that by the Kingdom
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:150284:67"/>
of Heaven is meant the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that was then
a National Church, yet your Argument is impertinent.</p>
                  <p>This was before the Commiſſion was given out, at which
time it is granted, that Children were Church-Members;
but if you would argue from Church-Memberſhip to a
right to Baptiſm, you muſt prove that they are now
Church-Members under the new Diſpenſation. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Church being changed from National to
Congregational, the Matter of which is viſible Saints, and
that is, ſuch as in the judgment of Charity are inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
holy; and the Form, mutual Conſent and Agreement;
and that Church-Memberſhip is put into the Commiſſion
to be the ground of Baptiſm: for if you prove not their
right to Baptiſm by the Commiſſion, you do nothing, and
this I think will be too hard a Task. Secondly, When
Children were Church-Members, Church Memberſhip was
not the ground of Baptiſm; Chriſt and <hi>John</hi> never bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
Church-Members, conſidered as ſuch, but firſt made
them Diſciples, and then baptized them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. they were
Church-Members before they were Diſciples of Chriſt, and
they were made Diſciples before they were baptized. Your
ſecond Argument was, That if Infants are Diſciples, then
they are the Subjects of Baptiſm according to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but they are ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> was denied. Now
pray conſider what weak Props they were you fortified
your <hi>minor</hi> with; at firſt you ſaid, a Child was a Diſciple
as ſoon as his Parents had dedicated him to be taught:
But do you think he is a Diſciple by Inſtructions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Commiſſion, and ſo a fit Subject to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
not having learn'd Jeſus Chriſt? Secondly, Do the
Parents dedicate their Children to be taught while Infants,
when they deſire you to baptize them? or do you undertake
to teach them while Infants, or do you ever look after
them, indeavouring to teach them? You ſay a Child is a
Scholar the firſt day he goes to School, tho he hath learnt
nothing; but is he a Scholar before he goes to School, or
a Scholar by Inſtruction, when he hath learn'd nothing?
You baptize them before they go to School, before you go
about to teach them; will Chriſt look on theſe as Diſciples to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:150284:67"/>
him by the Miniſtry of the Word, or on you Miniſters as
keeping cloſe to the Commiſſion? Theſe things will not hold
at the great Day, when the Commiſſion ſhall be laid open
again. Bear with me that I ſpeak ſo plain, for it is the
Cauſe of Chriſt that I am now pleading; his great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
wherein his Kingly Authority is ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
may be duly obſerved, and the Ordinance duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred.
However Children may be accounted Scholars
by us in an improper ſenſe the firſt day they go to School,
tho they have learned nothing; yet I ſhewed you, that
<hi>Philip</hi> did not account the Eunuch a Scholar, tho he had
actually ſubmitted himſelf to be taught by him, and he
had taught him till he underſtood by his verbal Profeſſion,
that he had learned Jeſus Chriſt; that is, indeed a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Chriſt, that hath learned Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo learned
him as to deny himſelf for Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 27, 28.
Nor do I believe that you do look upon all that you have
preached the Goſpel unto to be diſcipled unto Chriſt, and
ſo fit Subjects for Baptiſm according to the Commiſſion.
What you offered from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. has no foundation in
the Chapter, the Controverſy being about the Brethren,
not the Infants; and the Yoke not being Circumciſion
barely conſidered, but the falſe Doctrine together with
Circumciſion, which Doctrine could not be impoſed on
Infants, tho Circumciſion might. You aſſerted that Infants
are a part of a Nation, and yet I am ſure you will not
baptize upon this ground your ſelves, why then did you
offer it to us? The vileſt Wretches that are, and the
blackeſt Heathens in the World are part of a Nation; will
you baptize ſuch? Really I ſhould bluſh to look back on
ſuch an Argument. I have written theſe Lines in Love,
hoping that on ſecond thoughts things may be better conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
and that you will not ſtand by that you have not the
Word to ſtand by you in. The Commiſſion ſaith that, <hi>He
that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Do you believe
that all the Infants that you baptize ſhall be ſaved? if not,
then you do not believe that they are all Believers, and yet
you baptize them as ſuch. That Faith that fits the
Subject for Baptiſm, it is a believing with all the Heart;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:150284:68"/>
ſee <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annot. on <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37, 38. it is ſuch a Faith as doth
evidence the Subject's right to Salvation, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.
I ſhall offer you one Argument, and ſo conclude: If the
Apoſtles that were injoined to teach the Obſervation of
all things whatſoever Chriſt had commanded them, never
taught the Obſervation of Infant-Baptiſm, then Infant-Baptiſm
was never commanded them by Chriſt; but they
did not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall now take leave, and remain your
truly loving Friend,</p>

you a brief account of this Chapter, and of ſome
remarkable Paſſages contained therein. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. we
have the Women coming to the Sepulcher, and the time o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
their coming, which was at the end of the Sabbath, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
began to dawn towards the firſt day of the Week. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2.
we have an account of a great Earthquake, together with
the cauſe thereof: <hi>The Angel of the Lord deſcended from
Heaven, and rolled away the ſtone from the door, and ſate upon
it. Verſ.</hi> 3. we have a deſcription of this Angel, or this
extraordinary Meſſenger which was ſent from Heaven,
<hi>1ſt.</hi> He is deſcribed by his Countenance, <hi>His Countenance was
like Lightning. 2ly.</hi> By his Raiment, that <hi>was white as
Snow. Verſ.</hi> 4. we have the effect of this Apparition, with
reſpect to the keepers: <hi>They are aſtoniſhed at the ſight; for
fear of him the keepers did ſhake, and became as dead men.
Verſ.</hi> 5, 6, 7. we have the Angel talking with the Women,
in which there are three things obſervable: Firſt he gives
them a Caution, <hi>fear not:</hi> tho the Keepers did fear this
bright ſhining Angel, yet the Women ſhould not fear;
their end was good in being there, they came in love to
Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>I know that ye ſeek Jeſus that was crucified.</hi>
Secondly, He preacheth unto them the Reſurrection o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Chriſt; the firſt tidings of this welcome News ſounded it
their ears: <hi>He is not here, he is riſen, as he ſaid: come ſee the
place where the Lord lay.</hi> Thirdly, he ſends them on a haſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
errant; <hi>Go quickly and tell his Diſciples, that he is riſen from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:150284:69"/>
the dead; and behold he goeth before you into</hi> Galilee: <hi>there
ſhall you ſee him, lo I have told you. Verſ.</hi> 8, 9. the Women
return from the Sepulcher; and firſt we have the manner
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>how, and that was <hi>with fear and great joy.</hi> Secondly,
the ſpeed they made; they <hi>did run to bring his Diſciples
word.</hi> No doubt they thought it would be welcome News
to the Diſciples, as it was to themſelves. Thirdly, They
have a ſhort ſtop by the way, being met by the Lord Jeſus,
who ſaluted them with all hail: <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> or rejoice.
Upon this they came and held him by the feet, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
him. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. and here obſerve: Firſt Jeſus Chriſt
gives them another caution; <hi>Fear not.</hi> Secondly, he ſends
them forward in their Errant: <hi>Go and tell my Diſciples that I
go before them into</hi> Galilee, <hi>there ſhall they ſee me.</hi> Verſ. 11,
12, 13, 14, 15. we have a Narration of the Watchmens
coming into the City, to acquaint the Chief Prieſt with what
was done; and of the way they took to ſtifle the bleſſed
Tidings of the Reſurrection of Chriſt: <hi>They gave them large
mony to report, that his Diſciples came by night and ſtole him
away while they ſlept. Verſ.</hi> 16. tho the Diſciples were not
forward to believe that Chriſt was riſen, yet they go <hi>into</hi>
Galilee, <hi>and into a mountain, where Chriſt had appointed them.
Verſ.</hi> 17. Chriſt comes, and ſhews himſelf to his Diſciples,
according to his promiſe: and here we may ſee the effect of
his coming; <hi>When they ſaw him they worſhipped him, but ſome
doubted:</hi> that is, they doubted for a time; but at laſt
they believed. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. he declares to his Diſciples the
full and ample Power that he was inveſted withal: <hi>All
Power is given unto me, in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> By this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
he prepares his Diſciples to receive their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
which Commiſſion you have in <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. together
with an incouraging Promiſe of his own Preſence; <hi>Lo I am
with you always, unto the end of the world.</hi> My Text contains
in it two Branches of the Commiſſion; to teach, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize.
In which words we may obſerve theſe general parts:
Firſt, we have their miſſion, or ſending; <hi>Go ye therefore.</hi>
Secondly, we have the Subject, <hi>All Nations.</hi> Thirdly, their
work, and that is two-fold: <hi>1ſt,</hi> To teach; and <hi>2ly,</hi> To
baptize: In which there is the order to be obſerved; they
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:150284:69"/>
muſt firſt teach, and then baptize. <hi>3ly,</hi> we have the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Baptiſm, in this word <hi>Them:</hi> which word is a
Relative, the Antecedent is <hi>All Nations,</hi> taught or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled.
<hi>4ly,</hi> We have the Authority of the Ordinance in theſe
words: <hi>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Before I give you the Obſervation, I ſhall a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
open the Terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to their miſſion or ſending, <hi>Go ye therefore;</hi> there
are three things to be inquired into:</p>
                  <p>1. Who it is that ſends, and that is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
as appears in the preceding <hi>Verſe, Jeſus came and ſpake unto
them, and ſaid, go ye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Who they are that are ſent; Firſt more immediately
they are the eleven Diſciples, as appears by <hi>ver. 16, 17, 18.
Then the eleven went away into</hi> Galilee: <hi>and Jeſus came and
ſpake unto them, ſaying, Go ye.</hi> But more remotely, all ſuch
as God ſhould be pleaſed to gift, and qualify by his Spirit
to preach the Goſpel, and by his providence to call out,
and to open a door ſo to do. The Eleven were here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned,
but the Commiſſion was not reſtrained to them:
for Firſt, we find that there were others that did inſtantly
preach the Goſpel, as well as they, who had no other
Commiſſion but this, <hi>Acts 11. 19, 20. They that were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
abroad upon the Perſecution, preached the word not only
to the</hi> Jews, <hi>but to the</hi> Gentiles <hi>alſo.</hi> Now there was no
Commiſſion to preach to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> but this; therefore
it muſt be by this commiſſion, or none at all. I can't ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that they did run before they were ſent: for the
hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and turned to the Lord; and if ſent, it was by virtue
of this Commiſſion. Theſe were not the Apoſtles that
preached unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but ſuch as were ſcattered
abroad, when the Apoſtles ſtayed at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 5. 1.
compared with the <hi>4th.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) It's by virtue of this Commiſſion that the Goſpel
is preached at this day, and the promiſe of his Preſence
which is annex'd to it, remains to this day: <hi>Lo I am with
you always unto the end of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) Why did Chriſt ſend them? this word therefore
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:150284:70"/>
carries us back to the <hi>18th Verſe, All power is given to me
in Heaven and in Earth; Go ye therefore:</hi> He had power
to ſend them, and now he exerts his Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> What are we to underſtand by <hi>All Nations;</hi>
there is no great dubiouſneſs here, the Commiſſion is now
inlarged unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that was before reſtricted unto
the <hi>Jews.</hi> It's to all Nations, as Providence ſhould direct
them, and open a door to them: for there was a hand
of Providence in ſteering their courſe, <hi>Acts 16. 7. They
eſſayed to go into</hi> Bithynia, <hi>but the ſpirit ſuffered them not.
Mark</hi> renders it thus: <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Creature;</hi>
that is, To every rational Creature among the Sons and
Daughters of Men: Angels are rational Creatures, but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
are not ſent to preach the Goſpel to them. <hi>2ly,</hi> It
muſt be ſuch as have the uſe of their Reaſon among the
Sons and Daughters of Men: Children in an Infant-ſtate
are rational Creatures, but they have not the uſe of their
Reaſon and Underſtanding, they are not capable of hearing
and receiving the word; it would be but loſt labour to
preach the Goſpel to them: Miniſters are not bound by
their Commiſſion to preach to Children in an Infant-ſtate.
And here by the way obſerve, that if Miniſters are not
bound to preach the Goſpel to Children in an Infant-ſtate,
then they are not bound to baptize them in an Infant-ſtate:
for they muſt firſt teach before they baptize; that is, the
ſame Perſon: Not teach one, and baptize another that
was never taught.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What are we to underſtand by this word <hi>teaching?</hi>
1. To teach and to preach is the ſame thing, as appears
by comparing it with <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. it's the ſame Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and there it's ſaid, <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
To teach or to preach then is to open and interpret
the word by the word, and to apply it: To preach the
Goſpel is to preach Chriſt crucified, buried, and riſen
again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4. it is to declare the Doctrine of
Chriſt contained in his word, to preſs men by the word,
and exhort them to believe in Jeſus Chriſt; with aſſurance
from the promiſe of Chriſt, that <hi>whoſoever believeth ſhall
be ſaved; Mark 16. 15, 16. Luke</hi> 24. 47.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:150284:70"/>
2. To teach here, is to diſciple to Chriſt: it's granted by
them that underſtand the Greek, that the word is to make
Diſciples, or to bring Diſciples to Chriſt, or to diſciple to
Chriſt. Firſt then a Diſciple is a Scholar, one that learns:
So the Engliſh Schoolmaſter defines the word. <hi>Wilſon</hi> in his
Dictionary, tells you that a Diſciple is a Learner, a Scholar,
one that ſubmitteth to another to be taught; one who
learneth the doctrine of Chriſt, that he may believe and
practiſe it: The word does import as much in Scripture,
<hi>John</hi> 9. 27, 28. and he ſaid unto them, <hi>Will you be his
Diſciples?</hi> they anſwered him, <hi>Thou art his Diſciple, but we
are</hi> Moſes'<hi>s Diſciples.</hi> What does this import but that they
had learned the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that they would not
learn of Chriſt? it's obſerved, the word is ſometimes
tranſlated learned, <hi>John 6. 45. Every one that hath heard,
and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> And ſo the
word Undiſcipled is tranſlated Unlearned, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16.
A Diſciple of Chriſt then is one that hath learned Jeſus Chriſt,
and ſo learned him, as to deny himſelf for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>1. He is one that hath learned Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John 6. 45.
Every one that hath heard or learned of the Father,</hi> (or is
diſcipled of the Father) <hi>cometh unto me.</hi> A Perſon can't
come to Jeſus Chriſt, till he have learned Jeſus Chriſt; the
act of the Underſtanding muſt precede the act of the Will.</p>
                  <p>2. He is one that hath ſo learned Chriſt, as to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for Chriſt, <hi>Luke 14. 26. If any man come to me, and bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
not his Father, and his Mother, and his Brethren, and Siſters,
yea, and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> This
hatred here may not be underſtood of a poſitive hatred,
but of a leſs loving; the Soul muſt love Chriſt more
than theſe, or he muſt love theſe leſs than Chriſt, <hi>ver. 27.
And he that taketh not up his Croſs, and follows me, can't be
my Diſciple.</hi> Verſ. 33. <hi>And whoſoever it be of you, that
forſaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. A Diſciple here in my Text, and a Believer, <hi>Mark</hi>
16. 16. is the ſame thing; for it's the ſame Commiſſion,
tho variouſly expreſt, and the various terms or expreſſions
do help to explain each other. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Inſtitutions
obſerves, that the words Diſciple and Believer, are two
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:150284:71"/>
words to expreſs the ſame thing; and that <hi>Luke</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi>
does often make uſe of the word Diſciple for Believer, <hi>Acts</hi>
6. 1. <hi>When the multitude of Diſciples were increaſed;</hi> that is,
the multitude of Believers, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 26. the Diſciples (that
is, Believers) were firſt called Chriſtians at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi>
15. 10. <hi>Why tempt ye God to lay a Yoke on the neck of the
Diſciples?</hi> Theſe Diſciples were ſuch as had purified their
hearts by faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. And what were the Diſciples that
came together to break bread? <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. Were not theſe
Believers? To teach then, is to diſciple them unto Chriſt,
or to bring them to believe in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sometimes by Baptiſm, we are to underſtand the
extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, <hi>Acts 1. 5. And you ſhall be
baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not many days hence.</hi> This was
done when the Spirit appeared in the form of Cloven
Tongues, and sat upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>By this word Baptiſm, is ſometimes underſtood
Afflictions, Sufferings,</hi> Matth. 20. 22. You ſhall indeed drink
of the Cup that I am to drink of, and be baptized with the
Baptiſm that I am to be baptized with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By this word we are ſometimes to underſtand
Water-baptiſm, that which is an Ordinance of Chriſt:
<hi>John</hi> did baptize in <hi>Enon,</hi> for there was much Water: and
in this ſenſe I take the word here for Water-baptiſm, and
that for this Reaſon: It's a Baptiſm that is to be adminiſtred
by the Meſſengers or Miniſters of Chriſt. Now they can
adminiſter no other but Water-baptiſm; they can't baptize
with the Holy Ghoſt, that muſt be done by Chriſt: nor
they may not baptize with the Baptiſm of Afflictions, that's
work for the Enemies of Chriſt; they can no otherwiſe bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
but with Water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What are we to underſtand by this word
<hi>Them?</hi> This word reſpects the Subjects of Baptiſm; it's a
Relative, the Antecedent is <hi>All Nations,</hi> taught or diſcipled
to Chriſt: <hi>Go diſciple to me all Nations, baptizing them;</hi> that
is, them that are diſcipled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> What by theſe words, <hi>In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> This is the form of
words that is to be uſed in Baptiſm, and it's a part of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:150284:71"/>
form of Baptiſm, and doth denote one or both of theſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Their being baptized into the Doctrine of the Trinity,
which is owned and profeſt by thoſe that are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                  <p>2. To baptize by the Authority of the Trinity: To bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghoſt, is to baptize by the Authority of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. From the words I
ſhall give you this Obſervation, or Point of Doctrine:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That Believers, or ſuch as are diſcipled to Chriſt by the
Word, are the only Subjects of Baptiſm, according to Chriſt's
Commiſſion; theſe are to be found in the Commiſſion, and
there are no other to be found there; nor is there any other
Commiſſion le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t on Record for Miniſters to baptize by.</p>
                  <p>In the Proſecution of this Point, I ſhall, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Give
you a Deſcription of Baptiſm. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Prove the Point.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> Anſwer ſome Objections. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Give one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<hi>Fifthly,</hi> Make ſome Application thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall give you a Deſcription of Baptiſm. Baptiſm
is a dipping a Believer in Water by a Miniſter of Jeſus
Chriſt, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghoſt. Here is in this Deſcription the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator,
the Subject, Matter, and Form.</p>
                  <p>1. The Adminiſtrator, that muſt be a Miniſter of Chriſt,
and one that hath Commiſſion from Chriſt to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
<hi>Go preach and baptize.</hi> Now here I do not tie it to a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in Office, that is, to an Elder, one that hath a Paſtoral
Relation to a particular People, but to a preaching Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
Baptiſm being no more tied to Office or Power, than
Preaching is; Preaching is not reſtrained to Office or Power
by the Commiſſion, as I have ſhewed already: every one
that is gifted and qualified by the Spirit, and providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
call'd, ought to have Commiſſion to preach, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.
20. therefore ſuch have Commiſſion to baptize, <hi>Go teach
and baptize.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Subject muſt be a Believer, <hi>Acts 8. 37. If thou
believeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> with all thy Heart thou mayſt:</hi> the contrary that fairly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:150284:72"/>
offers it ſelf is this, If thou doſt not believe with all thy
Heart, thou mayſt not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, the Adminiſtrator can't poſſibly
know whether the Subject do believe with all his Heart, or
no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant it's true, yet it follows not but that the
Subject ought ſo to believe; a true Faith is required of the
Subject to give him a right to the Ordinance, as appears by
the forementioned place; <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy Heart,
thou mayſt.</hi> A Profeſſion of Faith gives the Adminiſtrator
a Call to adminiſter the Ordinance, <hi>Acts 5. 13. Then</hi> Simon
<hi>himſelf believed</hi> (that is, he made a Profeſſion of Faith)
<hi>and was baptized:</hi> and ſo the Eunuch upon a Profeſſion of
Faith was baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Commiſſion gives
him authority to adminiſter the Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>3. The Matter is Water, that is the Element that the
Subject is baptized in. John <hi>was baptizing in</hi> Enon, <hi>for there
was much Water;</hi> John 3. 23. <hi>Who can forbid Water, that
theſe ſhould not be baptized, that have received the Holy Ghoſt
as well as we?</hi> Acts 10. 47.</p>
                  <p>4. The Manner or Form, and that is by dipping, in the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>(1.) It is by dipping; it's granted almoſt by all, that the
word in the Commiſſion ſignifies to dip, or to plunge into
the Water, and ſignifies ſuch a Waſhing, as when Linen is
plunged or dipp'd in Bucks: this is confeſt by Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi>
who was a great Antagoniſt againſt the Baptiſt Intereſt.
What he after ſpeaks concerning the baptizing of Beds,
and Cups, and brazen Veſſels, that it was done without
dipping, is more than can be proved; that being a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Practice of Phariſees, I ſuppoſe they would not ſtick
at the trouble of dipping: but it's enough that he grants
that the primary ſignification of the word is to dip. The
Church of <hi>England</hi> grants it to be by dipping, and admits
of no other way by their Rubrick for the baptizing of
Children, but by dipping, except the Child be weak: They
ſay, if the Miniſter be certified that the Child be ſtrong,
and able to bear it, he ſhall dip it diſcreetly and warily.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:150284:72"/>
                     <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s Paraphraſe on the New Teſtament reads it thus,
<hi>Go and teach all Nations, and when they have learned dip
them.</hi> The Addition to <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotation tells us, that it's
apparent, that both Chriſt and <hi>John</hi> did baptize by dipping,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 23. It is obſerved by thoſe that underſtand the
Greek, that the word that is often tranſlated dipped, or
dippeth, comes from <hi>bapto,</hi> which is the primitive word that
ſignifies to dip. And here give me leave to tranſcribe a few
Lines made ready to my hand, by one that underſtands the
Greek: <hi>Mat. 26. 23. He that dippeth his hand with me in the
diſh:</hi> here the word is <hi>embapſas,</hi> the Participle of <hi>embapto,</hi>
which is <hi>bapto</hi> in Compoſition, and ſignifies the ſame. <hi>Mark
14. 20. He ſaid, it is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me
in the diſh:</hi> here the Participle of the Paſſive Voice of the
ſame Verb is uſed (to wit) <hi>embaptomenos,</hi> which is uſed in
the ſame ſenſe. <hi>Luke 16. 24. Send</hi> Lazarus <hi>that he may dip
the tip of his finger in Water,</hi> &amp;c. where the word is <hi>bapſe,</hi>
the Subjunctive Mood of <hi>bapto.</hi> John 13. 26. <hi>He it is to
whom I give a Sop, when I have dipped it: and when he had
dipped it, he gave it to</hi> Judas Iſcariot, <hi>the Son of</hi> Simon.
In the firſt Clauſe is uſed the Participle <hi>bapſas,</hi> from the
Primitive <hi>bapto:</hi> in the ſecond Clauſe is uſed the ſame, as in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 23. (to wit) the Participle <hi>embapſas.</hi> Rev. 19. 13.
<hi>Veſture dipt in Blood;</hi> where the Participle of the Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Tenſe of the Paſſive Voice is uſed (to wit) <hi>bebam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) It appears it is by dipping, in that there was
choice made of a place where there was much Water, <hi>John</hi>
3. 23. <hi>And</hi> John <hi>alſo was baptizing in</hi> Enon, <hi>for there was
much Water.</hi> If baptizing had been by any other way than
by dipping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there had been no need to make choice of a
place where there was much Water, a little Water would
have ſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed the turn, eſpecially if it had been by ſprinkling,
as the manner of ſome is: I ſuppoſe the ſame reaſon may
be render'd why <hi>John</hi> did baptize in <hi>Jordan;</hi> and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
came from all parts thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be baptized, for there was
much Water. Alſo <hi>Mark 1. 5. John</hi> baptized them in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Jordan.</hi> It's very ſtrange that he ſhould baptize them
in the River, if he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did it by ſprinkling a little Water on
the Face.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:150284:73"/>
(3.) It appears it was by dipping, in that the Subject and
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Adminiſtrator went both down into the Water, and then
baptized, and after the Subject was baptized, they came
both up out of the Water. Acts 8. 38, 39. <hi>And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Chariot to ſtand ſtill; and they went down both into
the Water, both</hi> Philip <hi>and the</hi> Eunuch; <hi>and he baptized him.
And when they were come up out of the Water,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 3. 16.
<hi>And Jeſus when he was baptized, went ſtraightway up out of
the Water,</hi> &amp;c. But here it is objected, that the word that
is tranſlated <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 38. [<hi>into</hi>] is ſometimes uſed for <hi>to,</hi>
and not for <hi>into;</hi> it may ſignify either, and is uſed promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly
for <hi>to</hi> or <hi>into;</hi> ſo that nothing may be concluded
barely from the word. To this I anſwer; ſuppoſe this be
granted, yet it follows not but that it may and ought to
be taken here for <hi>into,</hi> as it is tranſlated. For,</p>
                  <p>1. We ſee it was the Judgment of the Tranſlators, that
it ought to be ſo taken here, or elſe they would have tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it otherwiſe; I can't think they did it contrary to their
Judgment.</p>
                  <p>2. The Text tells you, they came to the Water, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to their going down into it: Firſt, <hi>They came unto a
certain Water,</hi> ver. 36. Did they draw back the Chariot, that
they might come unto it a ſecond time, and not go down
into it at all?</p>
                  <p>3. It is obſerved, that the Greek word that is tranſlated
<hi>unto,</hi> is a different word from that which is tranſlated <hi>into.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. This word <hi>into</hi> is conſonant with other Scriptures,
where Baptiſm is the Point in hand; <hi>Chriſt came up out of
the Water,</hi> and if ſo, he went firſt down into it. <hi>John</hi>
baptized them in the River of <hi>Jordan;</hi> how could that be,
unleſs they went down into the River? Again, it's obſerv'd,
that the Greek Prepoſitions are uſed elſewhere in their
proper ſenſe for <hi>into</hi> and <hi>out of;</hi> Mat. 27. 53. <hi>And came out
of their Graves, and went into the holy City:</hi> there it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> are both uſed in one Verſe, as well as in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 38, 39.
and certainly they were both in Priſon and Water before they
came out; here again theſe are borrowed Lines concerning
the Greek words, as the former were, yet I ſuppoſe my
Author hath not abuſed me in it.</p>
                  <p>(4.) It appears it is by Dipping, from the alluſion it hath
to a Burial; <hi>We are buried with him by Baptiſm,</hi> Col. 2. 12.
A Perſon is not buried that hath only a little Duſt or Earth
ſprinkled on his Face, but he is then buried when he is laid
into the Earth, and covered all over. <hi>Rom. 6. 4. We are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with him by Baptiſm into death; that even as Chriſt was
raiſed by the Glory of the Father, we alſo ſhould walk in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(5.) It appears it is by Dipping, in that the whole of the
Subject is to be baptized, and not a part only; the Commiſſion
is to baptize the Perſon, the Face is no more mentioned
than the Feet, nor is there any part mentioned but the
whole; the word is, <hi>baptizing them.</hi> If it be objected, that
the Face doth ſignify the Perſon; I anſwer, if that be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet the Perſon doth not ſignify the Face: It's the Perſon
that is to be baptized; but the ſprinkling a little Water on
the Face doth never waſh the whole of the Subject; and
this being done on the Face of a little Infant, is neither the
<hi>waſhing away the filth of the Fleſh, nor yet the anſwer of a
good Conſcience, by the Reſurrection of Chriſt:</hi> there is neither
the Figure, nor the thing figured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> It muſt be by Dipping in the Name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: In theſe two the
Form of the Ordinance doth conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall prove the truth of the Point by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And here, firſt, I ſhall prove that Diſciples are the
Subjects of Baptiſm, according to Chriſt's Commiſſion: And,
ſecondly; That they are the only Subjects thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Diſciples or Believers are the Subjects of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
according to Chriſt's Commiſſion. And here I need
not multiply many Scriptures, tho it be a Point, the truth
of which has been much oppoſed; the Truth of the Poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
lying ſo full and clear in the Text, which Text is the only
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:150284:74"/>
Commiſſion that Miniſters have to act by; and whatever
Arguments are brought to prove, that ſuch as are not diſcipled
to Chriſt by the Word (that is, by actual Inſtruction) ought
to be baptized, are all inſignificant, unleſs they can prove
it by this very Text: if their Commiſſion do not warrant
them to baptize ſuch as are not diſcipled to Chriſt by the
Word, there is no Text in all the New Teſtament that will
warrant them ſo to do. By the Commiſſion it is to diſciple
and baptize, yet I ſhall ſubjoin a few Scriptures for the
Confirmation thereof. Firſt, That Diſciples are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Baptiſm, <hi>Mark 16. 16. He that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
ſhall be ſaved:</hi> this is the ſame Commiſſion; and here
believing is to precede baptizing. Acts 2. 38. <hi>Repent, and be
baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If
Repentance here be not to be taken for Faith, yet I am ſure
it can't be without Faith: For, firſt, there cannot be a true
Godly Sorrow for crucifying the Son of God, without a
true ſight of a crucified Chriſt. Secondly, There can be no
acceptance of what is done without Faith; <hi>for without Faith
it is impoſſible to pleaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> God.</hi> Acts 8. 37. <hi>If thou believeſt
with all thy Heart, thou mayſt;</hi> that is, thou mayſt be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhall prove it by Scripture Precedents: And
here we have not one Precedent in all the Scripture of any
one Perſon that ever was baptized, till ſuch time as they did
believe, or were diſcipled unto Chriſt by the Word. The
firſt Precedent that I ſhall offer is, thoſe that were baptized
by Chriſt and <hi>John,</hi> they were Diſciples; <hi>John 4. 1. When the
Lord knew that the Phariſees had heard, that Chriſt made and
baptized more Diſciples than</hi> John, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe that were
baptized by <hi>John,</hi> who was the fore-runner of Chriſt, were
firſt diſcipled; and thoſe that were baptized by Chriſt when
he came, were firſt diſcipled. The Apoſtles, who well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
their Lord's Commiſſion, and who were injoyned by
the ſame Commiſſion to teach us to obſerve all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
Chriſt had commanded them, never baptized any but
ſuch as were firſt diſcipled to Chriſt by the Word; nor did
they ever teach others to baptize any but Diſciples; nor
is there any Apoſtolical Doctrine, from whence ſuch a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:150284:74"/>
Conſequence may be drawn, to warrant the baptizing
any but Diſciples. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. then as many as <hi>gladly receive

that God made with them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10. can ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
be denied by none; that it was the ſame Covenant
that was made, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10. appears by <hi>ver.</hi> 25. where the
Reaſon of the Judgments that the Lord threatens to bring

the Lord made with them, when he brought up out of the
Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was the ſame Covenant that was
made in <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. Now the New Covenant, or the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, is not according to this Covenant, it differs
from it in many reſpects; ſome of which I ſhall here lay
down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The New Covenant is abſolute, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33, 34.
the Tenour of this Covenant is; I will, and they ſhall:
<hi>I will write my Law in their hearts; I will be their God,
and they ſhall be my People; and they ſhall all know me, from
the leaſt to the greateſt: for I will forgive their Iniquity, and
remember their Sins no more.</hi> This is the Covenant of Grace,
and here is no Condition put into it, the performance of
which doth intitle the Subjects unto the Bleſſings thereof.</p>
                  <p>But the Covenant that God made with them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.
was a conditional Covenant, as appears <hi>Deut. 28. 1, 2. If you will
indeed obey my voice, and do all that I command you, then all
theſe Bleſſings ſhall come unto you:</hi> ver. 15. <hi>But if you will not
hearken unto me, to do all that I command you, then all
theſe Curſes ſhall come upon you, and overtake you,</hi> &amp;c. Now
according to all theſe words in the <hi>28th Chap.</hi> was <hi>Moſes</hi>
to make the Covenant with them in the <hi>29th,</hi> as appears by

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Covenant of Grace is a better Covenant,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. He is a Mediator of a better Covenant, eſtabliſhed

to their Unrighteouſneſs, and remember their Sins no more,
<hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>But there is not one promiſe of Juſtification nor Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

would have been good, and the Promiſes as good as the

                        </gap>ie from the leaſt to the greateſt: for I will forgive their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in is applied to the time of Chriſt's Oblation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10,
15, 16. the witneſs of the Spirit is there called in to atteſt
that great Truth that is laid down in the <hi>14th ver.</hi> that by
one Oblation he hath for ever perfected (or pardoned) them
that are ſanctified, whereof the Holy Ghoſt alſo is a witneſs:
the witneſs that the Spirit bears is this; <hi>Their Sins and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
will I remember no more:</hi> and from this teſtimony of
the Spirit the Apoſtle draws this inference, That where
remiſſion of theſe is, there is no more ſacrifice for ſin: but
there were multitudes of thoſe that entred into Covenant
with the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10. that were never juſtified nor
ſanctified. <hi>Deut. 29. 4. God hath not given them a Heart to
perceive, nor Eyes to ſee, nor Ears to hear unto this day.</hi> Rom.
11. 7. <hi>What then?</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath not obtained that which it
ſought after; but the Election hath obtained it, and the reſt
were blinded.</hi> There were of the Non-elect in this Covenant
that went without New Covenant-Bleſſings, <hi>ver. 8. As it is
written, God hath given them the ſpirit of ſlumber; Eyes that
they ſhould not ſee, and Ears that they ſhould not hear.</hi> This
does not look like that promiſe that God hath made in the
New Covenant to all the Subjects thereof, that they ſhall all
know him, from the leaſt to the greateſt of them; that
Covenant, the Subjects whereof, or part of the Subjects
thereof, might go without Juſtification and Sanctification, was
not the Covenant of Grace. But for this Covenant, many of
the Subjects thereof might and did go without Juſtification
and Sanctification; therefore it was not the Covenant of
Grace. Some of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>deed were juſtified and ſanctified,
but not by virtue of their Intereſt in this Covenant, but in

the Covenant of Grace: for all the Elect among the <hi>Jews</hi>
had an Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace at the ſame time.
Theſe two Covenants were in being together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Covenant of Grace contains only Bleſſings,
there is no Curſe put into that Covenant, the ſum and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
thereof is Bleſſedneſs. <hi>Gen. 22. 18. In thy Seed ſhall
all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> All the Subjects of
this Covenant are bleſſed, their Sins are all pardoned, and
ſuch are bleſſed ones: <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe Iniquities are

                  <p>But this Covenant contains Curſes as well as Bleſſings,

2. I deny that they were all Believers that at
this time were taken into Covenant with the Lord; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no argument can be drawn from it, to prove that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and their Children have intereſt in the Covenant of
Grace. This was certainly a mix'd people, there were
many among them that were vile and wicked. <hi>Moſes</hi> declares
that <hi>God had not given them Hearts to perceive, nor Eyes to
ſee, nor Ears to hear unto this day.</hi> Here were the blind and
the deaf, and I may ſay the hard-hearted too; and this
was the very day that they ſtood before the Lord, to enter
into Covenant with him. Here were the ſtrangers that were
in the Camp, as well as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which ſtrangers I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
were the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> for it's ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 38. that <hi>a
mixed multitude went up alſo.</hi> Do theſe look like Believers,
that have neither Eyes to ſee, nor Hearts to conſider? this
was a brave Camp indeed, if they were all Believers, from
the Hewer of their Wood to the Drawer of their Water.
I wonder how Miniſters can look upon this to be the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, that had ſuch a mix'd People to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
thereof; or upon theſe to be all Believers, or taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Covenant under that Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, They did all believe with a dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Faith, they did believe a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer. 1. This is ſooner ſpoken than proved.
It's a great queſtion, whether all the Camp had ſuch a Faith:
But, 2. Would ſuch a Faith ſerve the turn? Would it be
ſufficient to intereſt them and their Children in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace? if it would, why will not the like dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ical
Faith ſerve now? and if it will, then it's eaſy to prove
that almoſt all, if not every Engliſh-Man and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
have an Intereſt therein. Where will you find an
Engliſh-Man, tho never ſo profane and wicked, that does not
as much believe that Chriſt is come, as the generality of
the <hi>Jews</hi> did believe that he was to come? If this dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Faith be the Faith that ſome intend, when they ſay
that Believers and their Children have an intereſt in the
Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a right to be baptized, why then do they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xclude and put by the Children of any where this dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l
Faith is to be found? There are many that do agree
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:150284:77"/>
from the ſame ground, that the Children of Believers
have an Intereſt in the Covenant, and a right to Baptiſm,
that yet will baptize none whoſe Parents are not true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in the Judgment of Charity.</p>
                  <p>3. I deny that barely an Intereſt either in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
or in the Covenant of Grace, was or is the ground
of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> An Intereſt in this Covenant was not the ground of
Baptiſm; thoſe that came to <hi>John</hi> to be baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.
7. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 7. and were denied, had an intereſt in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
they were the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> with whom
this Covenant was originally made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 18. which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
took in all the natural Seed, conſidered as ſuch; and
this Covenant remained in being till Chriſt was offered up,
yet were theſe ſent away not baptized. Had an Intereſt in
this Covenant been the ground of Baptiſm, <hi>John</hi> would not
have ſent them away without it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I deny that barely an Intereſt in the Covenant of
Grace is the ground of Baptiſm: where do the Scriptures ſay
that ſuch as have an Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, have
have a Right to the Ordinance? For men to aſſert an intereſt
in the Covenant of Grace to be that which gives a right to
Baptiſm, and bring no Scripture to prove it, will go but a
little way with thoſe that make the Word their Rule in
the matters of worſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace precedes
Sanctification; a new Heart is an effect of this Intereſt, not
the cauſe. Now this Intereſt is inviſible; who can tell who
they are that have an intereſt in the Covenant of Grace,
till God change their hearts and lives by a work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication?
but the ground of Baptiſm muſt be viſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. If Believers and their Children have an Intereſt
in the Promiſe, then they have a right to Baptiſm: but Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and their Children have an intereſt in the Promiſe;
therefore they have a right to Baptiſm. <hi>Acts 2. 38, 39.
Repent and be baptized every one of you, for the Promiſe is to
you, and to your Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer. (1.) I deny the Subjects here to be Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
at the time when the Apoſtle ſaid, the Promiſe is to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:150284:78"/>
you and to your Children; and no Argument can be drawn
to prove a Privilege to Believers and their Seed, from
what is ſpoken to Unbelievers. That they were not Believers
may appear,</p>
                  <p>1. In that they were but under ſome Conviction, they
were pricked at the heart, that's all the account we have of
them: but Conviction and Converſion are two things; a
perſon may be convicted that is not converted; nay, he
muſt be convicted before he can be converted: the whole
need not the Phyſician, but they that are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ick.</p>
                  <p>2. They were ignorant of the way of Salvation,
and that a Perſon can't be that does believe: for Faith is as
well the act of the Underſtanding, as of the Will; their
ignorance of the way of Salvation appears in that they
cried out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It appears in that they were with many other words
exhorted to ſave themſelves from that untoward Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that is, as I apprehend, from the Judgments that hung
over the heads of that untoward Generation for rejecting
of Chriſt: but if they had believed, they had been ſaved
already, there had then been no need of that exhortation.</p>
                  <p>4. They did not all believe at laſt, <hi>ver. 41. Then they that
gladly received the Word, were baptized,</hi> &amp;c. There were but
a part of them that did embrace this exhortation.</p>
                  <p>(2.) I deny that by the word <hi>unto,</hi> is intended Intereſt in
the Promiſe; they had indeed the Promiſe, but the Offer
is one thing, and Intereſt is another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> God did never vouchſafe this Privilege of Intereſt in
the Promiſe to the Children of the deareſt of his Servants,
conſidered as ſuch, not to the Children of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi>
and <hi>Jacob. Rom. 9. 6. All are not</hi> Iſrael <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael;
then all that were of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had not an intereſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:
for the Promiſes were made to none but <hi>Iſrael (Jer.</hi>
31. 33.) <hi>ver.</hi> 7. neither becauſe they are the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
are they all Children, <hi>But in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be
called:</hi> ver. 8. ſo then they that are the Children of the
Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God; but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Promiſe are accounted for the Seed; that is,
the Seed with whom God did eſtabliſh his Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:150284:78"/>
17. 7. Here were ſome of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which
were the Children of the Fleſh, that were not the Children
of God, nor the Children of the Promiſe, nor accounted
for the Seed. <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. Jacob <hi>have I loved, and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I
hated;</hi> and yet <hi>Eſau</hi> was the Son of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> his firſt born.
Now can it be ſuppoſed, that a Perſon hated of God had an
Intereſt in the Promiſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> Such as have an intereſt in the Promiſe, ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
injoy the good and benefit thereof, Juſtification, and
Sanctification, and Glorification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. It cannot be that
the word of God has taken none effect: and if ſo, then it
cannot be that ſuch as have an Intereſt in the Promiſe
ſhould go without one or all of theſe Bleſſings, for they are
the effect of the Promiſe. There are none will ſay that all
the Children of Believers ſhall be ſaved, and yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
miſs of Salvation if they have an Intereſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>3ly. <hi>Once an Intereſt in the Promiſe, and for ever an
Intereſt in the Promiſe. Jer.</hi> 32. 40. I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Covenant with them, that I will never turn away from
them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their Hearts,
that they ſhall not depart from me. <hi>God covenants here for
himſelf and them too; for himſelf,</hi> that he will never turn
away from them, to do them good; <hi>for them,</hi> that he will put his
fear in their Hearts, that they ſhall not depart from him. <hi>And
here I ſhould think that none, that deny falling from Grace,
ſhould oppoſe me in this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) I deny that the offer of the Promiſe is the ground
of Baptiſm; thoſe that did not receive the Word had the
offer of the Promiſe, as well as thoſe that did: where-ever
the Goſpel comes, there comes the offer of the Promiſe;
it's not the offer of the Promiſe, but the Command, <hi>Repent
and be baptized,</hi> that's the Ground; the offer of the Promiſe
is a Motive to inforce the Exhortation. If the Queſtion
then be, What muſt thoſe do to whom the Promiſe is?
the Anſwer will be this, <hi>Repent, and be baptized.</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
muſt come between the offer of the Promiſe, and the
taking up of the Ordinance. But here it may be objected,
that Repentance is injoined the Parent, not the Child. I
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:150284:79"/>
anſwer, that Baptiſm alſo is injoined the Parent, not the
Child; there are no more required to be baptized, than are
required to repent antecedently thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Object. 3. <hi>If the Children of Believers are federally holy,
then they have a right to Baptiſm; but they are ſo.</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. For the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified in the
Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified in <hi>or</hi> to the Husband;
elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy. <hi>To
this I anſwer:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Theſe three Objections are but one in ſubſtance,
tho they vary in terms; for, to have an Intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
an Intereſt in the Promiſe, and to be fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
holy, is the ſame thing. If neither of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Objections will ſtand, then the third will not ſtand,
for they are all built on the ſame foundation; and it appears
by the Anſwers given already; that it is but a ſandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
that they are built upon.</p>
                  <p>2. Tho one of the Parents to whom the Apoſtle wrote
was a Believer when he wrote to them, yet they were
not ſo to be conſidered in their being ſanctified each to
the other, but as Husband and Wife. There was a Caſe of
Conſcience ſent to the Apoſtle for Reſolution, whether it
was lawful for the Believer to abide with his or her unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Yoke-fellow? this he anſwers in the Affirmative;
but withal tells them, <hi>ver. 12. To this ſpeak I, not the Lord.</hi>
Therefore it was neceſſary to demonſtrate it; and here, firſt,
he profeſſes the lawfulneſs of their Continuance by the
lawfulneſs of their State: <hi>The unbelieving Husband is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in,</hi> or <hi>to the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified in,</hi>
or <hi>to the Husband;</hi> that is, by the Ordinance of God, when
both were Unbelievers, according to that Scripture, <hi>Heb. 13. 5.
Marriage is honourable among all, and the Bed undefiled:</hi> Be they
who they will, Believers or Unbelievers, they did not live
in Fornication; but in Wedlock they were Husband and
Wife, and ſo were ſeparated from all others to the lawful
uſe of each others Bodys. Their Cohabitation was lawful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Word of God, and in this ſenſe the word
<hi>ſanctified</hi> is taken elſewhere (for that which is lawful)
1 <hi>Tim. 4. 5. Every Creature of God is good, and nothing to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:150284:79"/>
be refuſed; for it is ſanctified by the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. that is,
lawful to be uſed; they were married, and ſo were ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
each to the other; this he illuſtrates by an Argument
drawn from their Offspring, <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean,
but now are they holy.</hi> If they had not been married, and
ſo ſanctified each to the other by the Ordinance of God,
their Children had been unclean, they had been illegitimate,
unlawfully begotten. The word <hi>unclean</hi> is elſewhere taken
for that which is unlawful, <hi>Acts 10. 14. Not ſo, Lord; for I
have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean;</hi> nothing
that is forbidden by the Word: for the unclean Meats were
no otherwiſe unclean, than as they were forbidden: <hi>Rom.</hi>
14. 14. <hi>I know and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there
is nothing unclean in it ſelf.</hi> There is no inherent Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in thoſe Creatures, but they are clean or unclean, as
they are lawful or unlawful according to the Word of God,
and in this ſenſe I take the Uncleanneſs and Holineſs of the
Children; they are not illegitimate, but lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
                  <p>2. I deny the Holineſs of the Children here to be federal
Holineſs. For,</p>
                  <p>(1.) The Holineſs of the Child doth not ariſe from the
Faith of the believing Parent, but from the Sanctification of
the unbelieving, whoſe Sanctification did not ariſe from the
Faith of his Yoke-fellow, but from the Ordinance of God
when both were Unbelievers. Now there is nobody doth
account the Sanctification of the Unbeliever to be federal
Holineſs; and if that be not federal Holineſs, then the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of the Child can't be federal; for that's the Root from
whence the Holineſs of the Child doth ſpring: Now ſuch as
the Root is, ſuch are the Branches; ſuch as the Fountain,
ſuch are the Streams; the Effect can't riſe higher than the
Cauſe. The Holineſs of the Child ſpringing from the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the unbelieving Parent, muſt neceſſarily be of
the ſame kind.</p>
                  <p>(2.) The Apoſtle ſpeaks here of their Children indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſuch as were born when both were Unbelievers, as well
as thoſe that were born after one of the Parents did believe
(ſome of which, for ought we know, remained profeſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:150284:80"/>
Pagans, as well as one of the Parents, and yet holy.) <hi>Elſe
were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of the Child did not depend on the Faith of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
nor is there a word ſpoken of the Faith of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
in the Text, as if that were the ground either of
the Sanctification of the Unbeliever, or of the Holineſs of
the Child.</p>
                  <p>3. I deny federal Holineſs to be the ground of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>(1.) The Scripture doth no where make it the ground
of Baptiſm, neither directly, nor conſequentially; if it
doth, produce it: we may not run hand over head, and ſay
this is the ground, and the other thing is the ground, when
we have no ground in Scripture for what we ſay.</p>
                  <p>(2.) It's very apparent from the Word, that federal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
was not the ground of Baptiſm; all the <hi>Jews</hi> were
federally holy when Chriſt and <hi>John</hi> baptized, yet they
were made Diſciples before they were baptized, and ſo
not baptized as conſidered federally holy, but as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
unto Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. They that came to <hi>John</hi> to
be baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. were federally holy, and did in
effect plead their federal Holineſs as the ground of their
Claim to Baptiſm, they pleaded that they were the Children
of <hi>Abraham;</hi> now the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> were federally
holy, conſidered as ſuch, they were born intereſted in that
Covenant, that peculiar Covenant, by virtue of which they
were federally holy, a ſeparate People. Had their federal
Holineſs been queſtioned, they could have produced the
token of the Covenant in the foreskin of their Fleſh, and
yet theſe were denied the Ordinance notwithſtanding their
Plea. That they were denied, may appear,</p>
                  <p>1. In that he calls them a Generation of Vipers; who
can think that he would have branded them with ſo black a
Mark, and afterwards baptize them? Would all the Water in
<hi>Jordan</hi> have waſhed it off again? Was Baptiſm an Ordinance
appointed for a Viperous Brood?</p>
                  <p>2. He overrules their Plea: <hi>Think not to ſay within your
ſelves, We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father.</hi> He doth not deny
their relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but rejects their Plea: Birth-Privilege
did never intitle to Baptiſm; no Inſtance can be
given thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:150284:80"/>
3. He counſels them to take another courſe; <hi>Bring forth
Fruits meet for Repentance:</hi> this Counſel was rejected by
them; and ſo they go without the Ordinance. <hi>Luke 7. 30.
But the Phariſees and the Lawyers rejected the Counſel of God
againſt themſelves, not being baptized by him;</hi> that is, by <hi>John.</hi>
Had federal Holineſs been the ground of Baptiſm, <hi>John</hi>
would have baptized them as well as others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. If the Children of Believers are Diſciples, then
they have a right to Baptiſm, according to Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<hi>Mat. 28. 19. Go diſciple to me all Nations, baptizing
them,</hi> &amp;c. But the Children of Believers are Diſciples, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have a right to Baptiſm. Acts 15. 10. <hi>Why tempt
ye God to lay a yoke upon the Neck of the Diſciples, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we nor our Fathers were ever able to bear?</hi> This Yoke was
Circumciſion after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that was for
Children of eight days old, therefore Children of eight days
old are Diſciples, and ſo ought to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer: 1. I grant the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition, That
ſuch as are diſcipled to Chriſt by the Word, have a right to
Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>2. I deny the <hi>minor,</hi> That Children of eight days old are
Diſciples, or that they are intended or comprehended in the
word <hi>Diſciples, Acts</hi> 15. 10. it was the Brethren only on
whom they would have laid the Yoke, not a word of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in the whole Controverſy; <hi>ver. 1. They taught the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
Except ye be circumciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye
cannot be ſaved.</hi> They did not teach the Children, nor did
they teach the Brethren to circumciſe their Children, it was
not come ſo far as yet: the manner of <hi>Moſes</hi> here did
not reſpect the Subject but the Form; it was the Brethren
that muſt be circumciſed, but how? after the manner of
<hi>Moſes:</hi> The word <hi>ye</hi> is relative to the Brethren; had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of eight days old been the Antecedent, it had been
ſomething to the purpoſe; but it's the Brethren, among
whom Children of eight days old could not be numbered:
For, 1. They were ſuch as had received the Holy Ghoſt,
<hi>ver.</hi> 8. 2. They had purified their Hearts by Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.
3. They were ſuch, who from among the Gentiles were
turned unto God, <hi>ver.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:150284:81"/>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> By the Yoke here we are not to underſtand Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
barely conſidered, but Circumciſion binding them to
keep the Law in point of Juſtification, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. this was the
Yoke that neither they nor their Fathers were ever able to
bear; Circumciſion barely conſidered, Children of eight days
old were able to bear, and did. Now tho Circumciſion might
have been impoſed on the Children; yet the falſe Doctrine,
which was that wherein this intolerable Yoke did conſiſt,
could not, for Children are as incapable of receiving a Lie, as
they are of receiving the Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> A Diſciple is a Scholar, one that learns; but Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that are incapable of learning, are incapable of being
diſcipled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, that a Child is a Scholar the
firſt day he goes to School.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer; 1. If this were granted, yet it would
not follow, that he is a Scholar before he goes to School.
Now the Children of Believers, while in an Infant-ſtate, are
not gone ſo far, they are not entred in Chriſt's School: pray
ſhew me where Chriſt hath ſet up a School for teaching In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
in an Infant-ſtate; Who is the School-maſter that
Chriſt hath appointed to teach and inſtruct them? and where
is this teaching reſtrained to the Children of Believers? for
if there be ſuch a School, and it be not reſtrained to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Believers; then the Children of Unbelievers are
Diſciples as well as the Children of Believers, and ſo a
right to Baptiſm may be claimed for them too.</p>
                  <p>2. I grant that in ſome ſenſe a Child may be ſaid to be
a Scholar the firſt day he goes to School, according to the
common acceptation, provided he has learned ſomething;
but if he has learned nothing, I will not ſay he is a poor
Scholar, for properly he is none at all.</p>
                  <p>3. It is not enough to denominate a Perſon a Diſciple of
Chriſt, that he is in Chriſt's School, and under the teachings
of ſuch as are appointed by Chriſt to go and diſciple to him;
no, tho he hath freely and voluntarily ſubmitted himſelf
to be taught by them: the Eunuch had freely ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to <hi>Philip,</hi> to be taught by him; <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 31. Philip
<hi>anſwered his deſire, he went up into the Chariot and preached
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:150284:81"/>
Chriſt to him:</hi> but when he deſired to be baptized, <hi>Phili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
takes an account of him, whether he had learned Chriſt
before he could conclude him a Diſciple of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 37
38. from whence it does plainly appear, that a Diſciple of
Chriſt is one that hath not only been under the teachings
of Chriſt, but hath alſo learned Chriſt by the Word that he
hath been taught.</p>
                  <p>4. A Diſciple of Chriſt is one that hath ſo learned Chriſt
as to deny himſelf for Chriſt. <hi>Luke 14. 26. Except a
man hate Father and Mother, yea and his own Life alſo, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be my Diſciple.</hi> Children then that are incapable of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt, ſo as to deny themſelves for Chriſt, are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being diſcipled unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5. Such as are Church-members have a right to
baptiſm; but the Children of Believers are Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
therefore they have a right to Baptiſm. That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are Church-members, appears, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. when ſome
of the Branches were broken off, through unbelief, the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> were grafted in in their room, and did partake with
thoſe that remained of the root and fatneſs of the Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree.
Now when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were grafted in, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were grafted in with them; <hi>ver. 16. If the root be holy,
the branches alſo are holy.</hi> When the natural Branches were
broken off, they and their Children were broken off together:
ſo when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were grafted in, they and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were grafted in together.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer; 1. I deny that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as they were counted a National
Church, tho I grant that they were grafted in among them
as they were conſidered the univerſal viſible Church. The
Conſtitution of the Church was altered from National to
Congregational. As ſoon as Chriſt was offered up, their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
fell, their Prieſthood fell, their national Ordinances
alter; Tabernacles, and their national Church-officers were
all down. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> and all the Regions round
about were but one Church before; but now thoſe of them
that did embrace Jeſus Chriſt, were imbodied into particular
Congregations. There were a plurality of Churches in <hi>Judea:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:150284:82"/>
was unknown by face,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>unto the Churches of</hi>
undea, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
                  <p>2. I deny that the Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> were broken off,
together with their Parents: if an unbelieving <hi>Jew</hi> had a
Child that did believe, that believing Child was not broken
off with the unbelieving Father; the Child ſtood a Branch
upon the Root when the Father was gone.</p>
                  <p>3. I deny that there were more of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> grafted
in than did believe: it were ſtrange that the natural Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſhould be broken off becauſe of Unbelief, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
<hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be grafted in. What difference is
there between an unbelieving <hi>Jew,</hi> and an unbelieving <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi>
that the one muſt be accounted a Church-member, and
not the other? That there were none but Believers grafted
in is evident, for they had their ſtanding by faith; <hi>ver. 20.
They were broken off through Vnbelief, and thou ſtandeſt by
Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. I deny that the believing <hi>Gentile</hi> is the Root, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is but a Branch; the Root and the Branch are two things,
ver. 15. <hi>Thou beareſt not the Root, but the Root thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. I deny that the Children of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are the holy
Branches, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. they are the natural Branches that are
the holy Branches, the Children of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not the
Children of the <hi>Gentiles: ver. 15. for if the caſting away
of them be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall their
receiving be but life from the dead?</hi> that is, the <hi>Jews.</hi>
Here is an intimation of their return, that God will have a
time to call them again, and renders this as the Reaſon,
ver. 16. <hi>For if the Root be holy, ſo are the Branches.</hi> This
reſpects the Children of the <hi>Jews,</hi> not conſidered as ſuch,
but ſuch of them as ſhall in time believe, and ſo be grafted
in again, <hi>ver. 23. and they alſo if they abide not ſtill in unbelief,
ſhall be grafted in again, for God is able to graft them in.</hi> There
is no foundation in this <hi>Chapter</hi> for Childrens Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip.
That Children are not Church-members, will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appear, if we conſider the matter of a Goſpel-Church.</p>
                  <p>1. They are not Members of a particular inſtituted Church;
the matter of ſuch a Church is viſible Saints, ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:150284:82"/>
holy in the Judgment of Charity. This appears,
firſt, by the Titles that are given them in the Epiſtles that
were ſent to them, they are ſtiled Saints, ſuch as were
ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. he
Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> are ſtiled, <hi>Such as were in God
the Father, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1. 1. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it appears by the improvement that is made by each
individual Member; <hi>Your Faith groweth exceedingly, and
the love of every one of you aboundeth one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
2 Theſſ. 1. 3. This is not applicable to Children in
an Infant-ſtate, and yet it's applicable to the whole Church,
not only as it's collectively conſidered, but as it's diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
conſidered. <hi>Phil. 1. 6. I am perſwaded that he that
hath begun a good work in you, will not ceaſe to perfect the
ſame unto the coming of Chriſt, as it is meet for me to think
ſo of you all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. They are not Members of the univerſal viſible Church,
that alſo is made up of viſible Saints: 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 13. By one
Spirit are ye all baptized into one Body, and made to drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one Spirit, whether</hi> Jew <hi>or</hi> Gentile. A Jew that before was
born a Church-member, is not now to be owned as ſuch,
unleſs in the Judgment of Charity he be new-born. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.
4. <hi>There is one Body, and one Spirit, even as ye are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in one hope of your Calling: one Faith, one Baptiſm,
one God and Father of all. And to every one of us is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi>
This one Body is the univerſal, viſible Church, and it's
made up of ſuch as are called in one hope of their Calling,
and each individual Member hath in the Judgment of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
a meaſure of Grace; here is then no room for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to ſtand Members, that are not called in this one Hope,
that have not as yet a meaſure of Grace beſtowed on them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, The Children of Believers were
Church-members under the legal Diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer: <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Queſtion is not what they
were, but what they are; the Children of Unbelievers were
then Church-members, as well as Believers: all the Children of
the <hi>Jews</hi> were Church-members, and we muſt bewray our
ignorance if we will ſay that all the <hi>Jews</hi> were Believers:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:150284:83"/>
Unbelievers were then Church-members as well as Believers.
<hi>You believe not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>becauſe ye are not my Sheep, as I
ſaid unto you;</hi> and yet they were Church-members. Will
you argue, that the Children of ſuch who do not believe
are Church-members now, or that ſuch as do not believe, are
now Church-members becauſe they were ſuch then?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Conſtitution of the Church is now altered
(as I ſaid before) from national to congregational, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whereof is viſible Saints, and the form mutual Conſent;
neither of which are Children in an Infant-ſtate capable
of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We may not now take our meaſures from the
rules of that Diſpenſation any more for Members than for
Ordinances, and for Officers, the Laws of the Diſpenſation
being changed: there being a change of the Prieſthood,
there is made alſo of neceſſity a change of the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi>
7. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly.</hi> I deny Church-memberſhip to be the ground of
Baptiſm; that is, that Church-memberſhip which Children
once had; or that any Perſon that ſtood a Member of that
Church-ſtate, was ever baptized, conſidered as ſuch: the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> that came to <hi>John</hi> to be baptized, and were denied,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. were Church-members.</p>
                  <p>The Partition-wall was not then broken down, the national
Conſtitution was not then changed; all the <hi>Jews</hi> were
Church-members when Chriſt and <hi>John</hi> baptized, yet they
were not baptized conſidered as ſuch, but as diſcipled unto
Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm is adminiſtred antecedent to our being formed
Members of a particular inſtituted Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. they
were firſt diſcipled; ſecondly baptized; thirdly added unto
the Church; therefore Memberſhip in a particular Church
can't be the ground thereof, becauſe it's ſubſequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
and tho it be granted that the Subjects of Baptiſm
are Members of the univerſal viſible Church, as being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
unto Chriſt; yet it is upon the profeſſion of their
faith that they were and ſtill ought to be baptized, and
under no other Conſideration. <hi>Acts 8. 38. If thou believeſt
with all thy heart, thou maiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:150284:83"/>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 6. If Baptiſm came in the room of Circumciſion,
then Children may and ought to be baptized: but Baptiſm
came in the room of Circumciſion; therefore Children may
and ought to be baptized. That Baptiſm came in the room
of Circumciſion, appears, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. they are there
put one for another.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer. 1. I deny that Baptiſm came in the
room of Circumciſion. If Baptiſm and Circumciſion ſtood
together ſeveral years by the Ordinance of God, then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
did not come in the room of Circumciſion: but Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
and Circumciſion ſtood together ſeveral years by the
Ordinance of God; therefore Baptiſm did not come in the
room of Circumciſion. Circumciſion ſtood of divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
till Chriſt was offered up. If a <hi>Jew</hi> had been
diſcipled to Chriſt, and baptized, and the next day
made Father of a Son of eight days old, that Son muſt have
been circumciſed, or he had broken the Covenant: but God
ſent <hi>John</hi> to baptize; and Chriſt himſelf did baptize by his
Diſciples long before he was offered up.</p>
                  <p>2. Circumciſion belonged only to the Male, not to the
Female; but Baptiſm belongs to the Female as well as the
Male. Did the Baptiſm of the Female come in the room of
Circumciſion, when Circumciſion had never any place with
the Female? or can the Baptiſm of the Female be argued
from the Circumciſion of the Male? Is there any room to
form an Argument here, if it were granted that they
came one in the room of another?</p>
                  <p>3. Circumciſion was to be adminiſtred the eighth day,
not ſooner nor later; how comes it about that there is now
no preciſe time for a Child to be baptized in, if Baptiſm
came in the room of Circumciſion? Where did God ever
declare that Baptiſm ſhould be adminiſtred in the room of
Circumciſion? But he would no longer tie you to an exact
day or time; as for that you ſhould take your own time.</p>
                  <p>4. The Subjects treated of, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. were Believers every
one of them, they had received Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. they
were compleat in Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>5. It's ſpiritual Circumciſion that is there mentioned,
<hi>ver.</hi> 11. that which is made without hands, in putting off
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:150284:84"/>
the body of the Sins of the Fleſh by the Circumciſion of
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>6. It is not ſpiritual, but outward Baptiſm that is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>12th verſ. Buried with him in Baptiſm,</hi> that is,
Water-Baptiſm. Now how inconſiderately do Men argue,
when they ſay that Baptiſm and Circumciſion are put
one for the other, when the one is ſpiritual, and the
other outward? If you ſay that Baptiſm is here to be
taken of ſpiritual Baptiſm, and ſo they are put one for
another: I anſwer (if this be granted) this is foren from
the Caſe in hand: the Queſtion is, Whether Circumciſion
and Baptiſm, as they are conſidered the Ordinances of God,
and outwardly to be adminiſtred, are here put one for the
other? and that they are not, is ſo plain and clear, that
he that runs may read; there is then no ground from this
Text to ſay that Baptiſm came in the room of Circumciſion,
nor is there another Text to be found from whence ſuch a
Concluſion may be drawn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 7. If Children be capable of the Kingdom of God,
and the Bleſſing of Chriſt, which are the greater, then they
are capable of Baptiſm, which is the leſſer: But Children
are capable of the Kingdom of God, and of the Bleſſing
of Chriſt, that is the greater; therefore they are capable
of Baptiſm, which is the leſſer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That they are capable of the greater, appears in that
Chriſt ſaith,</hi> Suffer little Children to come unto me, and
forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God; and he took
them in his Arms and bleſſed them.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer: It does not follow that they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the leſſer, tho it be granted that they are capable of
the greater. The Supper of the Lord may be called the
leſſer, as well as Baptiſm: but Children that are capable of
the Kingdom of God, and the Bleſſing of Chriſt, which is
the greater, are not capable of the Supper of the Lord, which
is the leſſer; and yet there is no more required as a Prequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to the Supper of the Lord than there is to Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 8. Children are as capable now of Baptiſm, as
they were formerly of Circumciſion; and why then ſhould
they be denied?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:150284:84"/>
To this I anſwer: I do not diſpute their Capacity, but
the Authority thereof; there was a Command for that, <hi>Gen.</hi>
17. 10, 11. ſhew me the like Command for this, and I will
yield the point. <hi>Abraham</hi> did not circumciſe his <hi>Iſhmael</hi> at
eight days old, becauſe there was no Command for it: nor
would he have circumciſed his <hi>Iſaac</hi> at eight days old if
he had not had a Command ſo to do. Either Believers are
commanded to baptize their Children, or they are not; if
they are, produce it; if they are not, then there is no
ſuch thing as Infant-Baptiſm of Divine Inſtitution. If the
Duty of baptizing Children in an Infant-ſtate do not lie
on the believing Parent, then I would fain know on
whom it doth lie: I can't think that it lies on the Child
while in an Infant-ſtate; the Child in an Infant-ſtate is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
capable of knowing what is matter of Duty, nor yet of
doing: Nor doth it lie on the Miniſter; for, firſt, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
hath no Power to baptize the Child if the Parent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to have it done. Secondly, He hath no Commiſſion ſo
to do in caſe the Parent do conſent to it. They are Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
only that are put into his Commiſſion; but the Children
of Believers are not diſcipled in an Infant-ſtate, therefore
they are not put into his Commiſſion. Where ſhall we find
on whom the Duty of Infant-Baptiſm is incumbent, if there
be any ſuch thing? Precepts do not leave us at a loſs who
it is they bind to that Duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 9. We read of whole Houſes that were baptized,
and it's probable that there were Children in ſome or all of
them.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer: 1. If it be probable, yet it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and therefore no Argument can be drawn from it:
could it be proved that there had been Children there, then
there would have been ſome room for an Argument; but
that can't be done.</p>
                  <p>2. It's more probable that there were no Children there,
in that there are but four Houſholds mentioned among ſo
many thouſands that were baptized, and were all known to
be Believers. This affords a ſtrong Preſumption, that the
Apoſtle did not baptize the Houſhold upon the Faith of
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Parent; if he had, there would have been multitudes
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:150284:85"/>
of Houſholds that would have been baptized, if it had been
common to baptize whole Houſholds: I ſee no reaſon why
theſe four ſhould be mentioned more than others.</p>
                  <p>3. The Jailor believ'd in God with all his Houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.
34. and <hi>Criſpus,</hi> the chief Ruler of the Synagogue, believ'd
in God with all his Houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 8. Here are two of the

and Baptiſm under the Goſpel, that were admitted to
Church-memberſhip and Circumciſion under the Law; then
Children are loſers by the coming of Chriſt in reſpect of

were Children in thoſe Houſes where the Paſſover was eaten.
Why do ye not plead for the Supper for your Children in the
room of the Paſſover, as well as for Baptiſm in the room of
Circumciſion? you have as much ground to plead for the one
as for the other. And what have we in the room of the
Feaſt of Firſt-fruits, and of the Feaſt of Ingatherings?
ſhall we ſay that we are loſers by the coming of Chriſt in
reſpect of outward Privileges, becauſe we have nothing in
the room of theſe Feaſts?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 11. But we are to teach all Nations, and to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
them; Children are a part of a Nation, therefore they
muſt be baptized.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer: 1. Turk and Pope are parts of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tho not both of the ſame Nation, and ſo are all the
Pagans and Heathens in the World; muſt all theſe be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
becauſe they are part of a Nation?</p>
                  <p>2. Tho Children are part of a Nation, yet they are not
part of a diſcipled Nation, they themſelves being not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
to Chriſt; the word <hi>them</hi> is relative to all Nations
ſo and ſo modified and qualified; it is not all Nations conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as ſuch, but all Nations diſcipled to Chriſt that ought
to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>III. I ſhall give one Reaſon of the Point, why Believers,
or ſuch as are diſcipled to Chriſt by the Word, are the only
Subjects of Baptiſm according to Chriſt's Commiſſion, and
that is, becauſe ſuch only are put into the Commiſſion; theſe
are to be found there, and there are none but theſe to be
found there. Miniſters muſt keep cloſe to their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and if they do, they will find that there are no more to
be baptized by them than are diſcipled unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>IV. I ſhall make ſome Application of the Point.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, By way of Information: Is it ſo that Believers,
or ſuch as are diſcipled to Chriſt by the Word, are the only
Subjects of Baptiſm according to Chriſt's Commiſſion?</p>
                  <p>Then, <hi>1ſt.</hi> It may inform us, that Miniſters have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Authority to diſciple to Chriſt by the Word, and to
baptize ſuch as are diſcipled: That if the Queſtion be, By
what Authority they do theſe things, and who gave them
this Authority? they have their Anſwer ready at hand, they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:150284:86"/>
have it from Chriſt; they have it not of Man, nor from
Man; they have it not from the Magiſtrate, nor from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
that were before them; nor yet from any Church
or Churches, but from Chriſt. That they have ſufficient
Authority for what they do of this kind, will appear in a
few Particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. They have a Commiſſion from Chriſt for what they do,
and that under the broad Seal of Heaven: Chriſt came and
ſpake unto them, and ſaid, <hi>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing
them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghoſt.</hi> They are ſent by Chriſt, and have their Work
aſſign'd them by Chriſt; they have their Commiſſion to
ſhow for what they do. The Baptiſm of Diſciples is not
of Men, but of God, their Commiſſion is from him who
is God as well as Man.</p>
                  <p>2. Jeſus Chriſt had Authority to give them this Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and he declared his Authority before he gave it, <hi>Mat.</hi>
28. 18. <hi>All Power is given unto me both in Heaven and in
Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Chriſt had his Authority from the Father, who is the
Lord of the whole Earth, in whom all Power is originally
veſted by right of Creation. John 5. 22, 23. <hi>The Father
judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Power unto the Son:
That all Men might honour the Son, even as they honour the
Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> It may inform us what the uſe and benefit of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is that a Believer may expect in taking up of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1.</hi> It is an obliging Ordinance; it binds the Soul to die
to Sin, and live unto Holineſs: <hi>Rom. 6. 2, 3, 4, 5. How
ſhall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein? Know
you not, that as many of us as were baptized into Chriſt, were
baptized into his Death? Therefore we are buried with him by
Baptiſm into Death; that even as Chriſt was raiſed by the Glory
of the Father, we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of Life. We are
buried with him by Baptiſm into Death;</hi> that as the Body that
is buried in the Grave lies rotting and conſuming away, ſo
the body of Sin ſhould waſte and conſume away.</p>
                  <p>2. It's a confirming Ordinance, it's of uſe to confirm our
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:150284:86"/>
Faith in the remiſſion of Sin by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.
Acts 2. 38. <hi>Repent, and be baptized for the remiſſion of Sin,</hi> &amp;c.
Baptiſm doth not remit Sin, but it's a figure of that Blood
by which the guilt of Sin is waſh'd away: it's an Evidence
together with Faith of our Title to Salvation. <hi>Mark 16. 16.
He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> It's no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
by it ſelf, but together with Faith it is, as it's taken
up in Obedience to the Will of God; without Faith it's of
no uſe at all, and therefore there is no reaſon to contend for
it for ſuch as do not believe; but together with Faith it's of
great uſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I would make uſe of it by way of Caution;
firſt to Miniſters, and ſecondly to People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To Miniſters, and that in two Branches:</p>
                  <p>1. To beware they do not miſtake the Subject of Baptiſm,
and ſo adminiſter the Ordinance to thoſe that have no
right to it. I ſhall here propoſe a few things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                  <p>(1.) There are a great many Miniſters that are miſtaken
(I mean ſuch as are for Infant-Baptiſm) I do not lay down
this upon a bare Conjecture, but upon certain knowledg:
Miniſters are divided into four Parties about the Subjects;
tho they are all for baptizing of Children, yet not for the
baptizing of all Children; and three of theſe Parties are
miſtaken, which is ground enough to put the fourth upon a
further ſearch and inquiry: for tho they ſeem to be all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that Children are the Subjects according to the Rule, yet
they are greatly divided whoſe Children they are that are
the right Subjects according to the Rule; ſome will baptize
all Children whoſe Parents make a verbal Profeſſion of
Chriſt, tho their Converſation do utterly deſtroy their
Profeſſion; a ſecond ſort will baptize all except Baſtards:
A third ſort will baptize none but ſuch whoſe Parents are
true Believers in the Judgment of Charity: A fourth ſort
will baptize none but ſuch whoſe Parents, one or both, are
in Communion with themſelves. Here are four Opinions,
and there is but one Truth, therefore three of theſe muſt
needs err, either they are too large, or too ſhort in their
Judgment; and I do not in the leaſt queſtion but the fourth
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:150284:87"/>
is in an Error alſo; he that is moſt ſtrict in the Point of
Infant-Baptiſm is too large, there being neither Precept nor
Precedent for his Practice.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Conſider, if you baptize a wrong Subject, you do
it in your own Name, not in the Name of Chriſt; my
meaning is, you do it by your own Authority, not by the
Authority of Chriſt, having no Commiſſion from him for
what you do.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Conſider, it's a bold attempt for Miniſters to ſay,
I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghoſt, if the Subject be not a Diſciple of
Chriſt: This is like ſetting the broad Seal of Heaven to a
Patent of their own drawing up.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Miniſters muſt give an account of their Stewardſhip
another day: <hi>The Books ſhall be opened, and every Man ſhall
be judged out of the things that are written in the Books,
according as his Works have been;</hi> Rev. 20. 11. Then the
Commiſſion will be laid open once more, and Miniſters muſt
be tried whether they have obſerved Chriſt's order, firſt
to diſciple, and then to baptize.</p>
                  <p>2. I would caution Miniſters to beware they do not miſtake
the form of Adminiſtration, and make uſe of ſprinkling
inſtead of dipping.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> Conſider there are a great many Miniſters that do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
miſtake, or alter and change the form; ſome there are
that do grant that the word in the Commiſſion ſignifies to
dip, and that it was the Primitive Practice that Chriſt and
<hi>John</hi> did baptize by Dipping, that yet make uſe of Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
inſtead of Dipping, becauſe we are under a cold Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and alledg this for their Practice, That God will have
Mercy and not Sacrifice: and that where moral Precepts
and poſitive Precepts do interfere, there poſitive Precepts
muſt give place; as when <hi>David</hi> eat of the Shew-bread, and
the Diſciples pluck'd the Ears of Corn upon the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer: 1. Such as do think it good to alter
the form of Baptiſm from Dipping to Sprinkling under
this Conſideration, had beſt to conſider whether it were
not neceſſary to alter their form of words too, and ſay, I
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:150284:87"/>
rantize thee, inſtead of I baptize thee; that ſo they may
ſpeak truth in what they ſay, ſeeing they do it in the Name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>2. If the coldneſs of the Climate be ſuch that it will not
admit of dipping, why do you do any thing in the room
thereof? Where is your Authority for that? you are to
baptize if you do any thing, it's not left to your diſcretion
which of theſe ſhall be done by you: this is to rantize in
your own Name.</p>
                  <p>3. I grant that in ſome caſes poſitive Precepts have given
place when they have interfer'd with moral; but this is no
where made a general Rule; for ſometimes moral Precepts
have given place to poſitive, as when God commanded <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
to offer up his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> a Burnt-offering, the moral
Precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> gave place to the poſitive.</p>
                  <p>4. When poſitive Precepts have given place to moral, it
hath been in ſome caſe of exigency that hath ſuddenly fallen
out, where in a little time the Subject might return to his
Duty, unto the poſitive Precept again: but if the poſitive
Precept to Dip muſt give place to the moral, becauſe of
the coldneſs of the Climate, we ſhall never have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to return to our Duty to the poſitive Precept more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our Climate will never alter; it will be always cold, and
ſo the poſitive Precept to Dip, will be of no more uſe to us,
than the Altar that was built on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan</hi>
was to them, which was not built to offer Sacrifice thereon,
but to be a Witneſs of what was formerly done, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22. 28.
ſo the poſitive Precept for Dipping ſhall only ſtand as a
Monument of what was done in the Primitive Time.</p>
                  <p>5. It's but a begging the Queſtion in this caſe, to ſay
that the poſitive Precept doth interfere with the moral. No
inſtance can be given of any one Perſon diſcipled to Chriſt,
that ever ſuſtain'd the leaſt damage, or had his Health im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
by being Dipt, no not in the coldeſt ſeaſon under this
cold Climate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> Conſider, if you miſtake the Form, you miſtake the
Eſſence, for the Eſſence of a thing lies as well in the Form
as in the Matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> If you miſtake the Form you deceive the Subject,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:150284:88"/>
he thinks he is baptized when it's no ſuch matter, he is but
rantized, not baptized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly,</hi> If you miſtake the Form, the Subject loſes the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Ordinance; for it's not Rantiſm, but Baptiſm
that obligeth the Subject to die to Sin, and to live to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. It's Baptiſm, not Rantiſm that doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
together with Faith our Title to Salvation, <hi>Mark</hi>
16. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would caution People, and that in two
Branches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> To beware you do not take up this Ordinance of
Baptiſm till ſuch time as you are diſcipled unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>1. Conſider, there are many that will deſire to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and are ſo, that are not diſcipled in deed but only in
ſhew; <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized, and I ſuppoſe there is no
doubt but <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and many more
were baptized, that were never really diſcipled to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. Conſider, you have no right to the Ordinance till you
believe; <hi>Acts 8. 37. If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou
mayſt:</hi> the contrary that offers it ſelf is this, If thou doſt
not believe with all thy heart, thou mayſt not.</p>
                  <p>3. The Ordinance will ſtand you in no ſtead if you do
not believe, it will be no ways acceptable unto God, nor
profitable to your ſelves; <hi>Without Faith it's impoſſible to pleaſe
God;</hi> and without Faith it will be no Evidence of your Title
to Salvation: it's <hi>not the putting away the filth of the Fleſh,
but the anſwer of a good Conſcience by the Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi>
that will ſtand us in ſtead.</p>
                  <p>4. You will make your ſelves Hypocrites thereby, rank
your ſelves among the number of fooliſh Virgins, and ſo
render your Condition worſe than it was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> I would caution ſuch as are diſcipled to Chriſt, to
beware they do not reſt ſatisfied without taking up the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance:
And here conſider a few things.</p>
                  <p>1. There are many that do give good tokens of their
Love to Chriſt, to his Ways, and to his Saints, that yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unbaptized.</p>
                  <p>2. Conſider you do not only lie ſhort of your Duty here
while you do lie ſhort of the Duty of Baptiſm, but you lie
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:150284:88"/>
ſhort of many other Duties as well as of this; ſhort of the
Duty of Church-Communion, ſhort of the Supper of the
Lord.</p>
                  <p>3. You do not only lie ſhort of Duty, but you debar your
ſelves of your Privileges alſo; you complain of the want of
Aſſurance, and neglect the means of Aſſurance; Baptiſm and
the Supper of the Lord are ſtrengthening and confirming
Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>4. The neglect of Duty when it may be performed is
Sin, as well as the commiſſion of Evil; ſo that you live in
Sin all the while you live in the neglect of Duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> I would make uſe of it by way of Examination;
try then whether you be diſcipled unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>1. Have you that Gift by which you underſtand the
Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven? I call it a Gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Scripture calls it ſo, <hi>Mat. 13. 11. To you it's given
to know the Myſtery of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them
it is not given.</hi> No natural Abilities can reach this; no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Parts can furniſh us with the knowledg thereof, it's
the Gift of Chriſt; <hi>John 17. 2, 3. That I may give eternal
Life to as many as thou haſt given me: And this is Life eternal,
to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou
haſt ſent.</hi> The great Myſtery of Godlineſs, is God in Chriſt,
God manifeſted in the Fleſh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. Do you know
Jeſus Chriſt? do you know him in his Natures, God-man,
two Natures united in one; Man, that he might do and
ſuffer the Will of God; and God, that he might merit by
doing and ſuffering? Do you know him in his Offices, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
Prieſt and King? He that hath truly learned Jeſus
Chriſt, is diſcipled unto Chriſt. I ſhall now lay you down a
few Marks of a Perſon that hath truly learned, or is diſcipled
unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>(1.) It's a ſign that a Perſon is diſcipled unto Chriſt, or
that he hath truly learned Jeſus Chriſt, if the Will doth
follow the Underſtanding, cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt; where
the Soul makes a Reſignation of himſelf to Chriſt, to be
taught by him, and ſaved by him, and ruled and governed
by him, and him alone; where he goes out of his own
Righteouſneſs, and applys the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150284:89"/>
in point of Juſtification; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. when the Soul is
willing to <hi>be found in him, not having his own Righteouſneſs,
which is of the Law, but the Righteouſneſs of God, which
is by Faith:</hi> I ſay, this is a ſign of a Diſciple of Chriſt.
Pſal. 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their Truſt in
thee.</hi> John 6. 45. <hi>Every one that hath heard, and learned of
the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> It's a ſign that the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is truly inlightened where the Will follows the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>(2.) It's a ſign that a Soul hath truly learned Jeſus Chriſt,
and is indeed diſcipled unto Chriſt, if he hath ſo learned
Chriſt as to deny himſelf for Chriſt: Luke 14. 26. <hi>Except a
Man hate Father and Mother, yea and his own Life, he cannot
be my Diſciple.</hi> There is a threefold Self-denial.</p>
                  <p>1. A denial of ſinful ſelf, this muſt be in all caſes, in all
places, at all times. <hi>He that nameth the Name of Chriſt,
let him depart from all Iniquity;</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>2. A denial of religious ſelf; but this is only in the point
of Juſtification; <hi>Phil. 3. 9. I would not be found in my own
Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but in the Righteouſneſs of
God, which is by Faith.</hi> We muſt go out of every thing of
our own, Duty and Qualifications, lay all at the feet of
Chriſt, and reſt ſolely on his Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>3. There is a denial of natural ſelf; ſelf-Riches, Honour,
Pleaſure, Liberty, Life and all; but this muſt be only when
any, or all of theſe come in competition with Chriſt, then
we muſt take up our Croſs and follow him, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 27.</p>
                  <p>(3.) It's a ſign of a Diſciple of Chriſt, where there is
true Love to thoſe that are diſcipled unto Chriſt: <hi>John</hi> 13.
35. <hi>By this ſhall all men know that you are my Diſciples, if
you have love one to another:</hi> Love to Saints, as Saints, purely
upon the account of the Image of God that appears in them,
is a Mark by which a Man may be known to himſelf, and
others too, to be a Diſciple of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly.</hi> I would make uſe of it by way of Exhortation
to ſuch as are diſcipled to Chriſt, and not yet baptized, that
you would now take up the Ordinance: And here I ſhall
lay down a few Motives to inforce the Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:150284:89"/>
1. Conſider it's your Duty; as ſoon as a Perſon is diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
unto Chriſt, he is bound to be baptized: my Text
injoins the Subject as well as the Adminiſtrator, <hi>Go diſciple to
me,</hi> i. e. <hi>baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 2. 38. <hi>Repent, and be
baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Conſider you are meet Subjects for Baptiſm; you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
therefore you may: you are put into the Commiſſion
as having a right to the Ordinance; you are capable to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God in Spirit and in Truth; and they are ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
that the Lord himſelf ſeeks for, <hi>John</hi> 4. 23.</p>
                  <p>3. Conſider it was not the Practice of the Primitive
Chriſtians to delay in this matter; however it's now become
too much a Practice: Three thouſand converted and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
the ſame day, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. The Jaylor and his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
converted and baptized the ſame hour of the night,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. 33.</p>
                  <p>4. Conſider, a little delay in this matter hath met with a
Reprehenſion; <hi>Why tarrieſt thou? ariſe, and be baptized:</hi>
Acts 22. 16.</p>
                  <p>5. Conſider, it's your Privilege as well as your Duty; this
is one ſtep towards Church-Communion; this prepares you
to join Communion regularly: Acts 2. 41. <hi>Then they that
gladly received the Word, were baptized; and the ſame day
there were added unto them about three thouſand Souls.</hi> Firſt,
diſcipled; ſecondly, baptized; and thirdly, added to the
Church. Here is the Apoſtolical Order; and being added,
they are admitted to all the Ordinances: <hi>They continued in the
Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and breaking of Bread, and
Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, they have not that aſſurance
of their being diſcipled unto Chriſt as they deſire to have.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer: Should we ſtay from taking up the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
till we have that aſſurance as we deſire to have, we
may ſtay till it be too late; I know none that hath that
aſſurance as they deſire to have; their aſſurance is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <p>2. The way to attain aſſurance is to take up the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
<hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved:</hi>
Mark 16. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:150284:90"/>
3. It's not the Faith of Aſſurance, but the Faith of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combance,
or Reliance, that gives a right to the Ordinance:
<hi>Acts 8. 37. If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayſt:</hi>
and this a Perſon may do that yet is in the dark, whether
he do believe or no, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10.</p>
                  <p>4. If you can take up the Ordinance purely in obedience
to the Command of God, ſubmitting your ſelves to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory
Authority of the Lord Jeſus, you may go on with
Comfort, it's a true ſign that your Natures are changed:
<hi>For the carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject
unto the Law of God, neither indeed can be;</hi> Rom. 8. 7. And
if your Natures are changed, there is a Light infuſed, by
which you are inſtantly diſcipled unto Chriſt: 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6.
God who commanded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined
in our Hearts, to give the light of the knowledg of the Glory of
God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

<hi>An Impartial Account of the</hi> Portſmouth <hi>Diſputation,</hi>
—by <hi>Samuel Chandler, William Leigh, Benjamin Robinſon.</hi>
Wherein I find ſuch unchriſtian Reflections and Wrong done
you, as ſutes not with the Profeſſion they make of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but greatly demonſtrates the badneſs of their Cauſe.
And I wonder at their Impudence in putting ſo plain a Cheat
upon the World, as I find in <hi>pag.</hi> 79. in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
Whether he might not have ſpared all his <hi>Dutch?</hi> ſeeing
<hi>Doop</hi> in that Language ſignifies only to waſh, and is uſed
when they only pour on Water. That this account of the
word <hi>Doop</hi> is notoriouſly falſe appears from the common uſe
of the word, and the account which is given of it in their
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:150284:90"/>
Dictionaries. One I have by me, which I believe is the
largeſt and beſt in that Tongue, it being a double Dictionary of
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> with Grammars to
each of them: by <hi>Hendrick Hexham</hi> and <hi>Daniel Manly,</hi> and
printed at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> 1675, and 1678. wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
word Dip is render'd <hi>Doop:</hi> as, to dip in a Sauce, <hi>Doopen in een
ſanſſe;</hi> to dip to the bottom, <hi>Doopen tot den grondt toe:</hi> Dipped
<hi>Gedoopt;</hi> a dipping, <hi>een doopinge;</hi> and <hi>Doop, Doopſel</hi> Baptiſm;
<hi>Doopen</hi> to baptize, <hi>Dooper</hi> Baptizer, <hi>Doop dagh</hi> the day of
Baptiſm; <hi>Doopen onder her water,</hi> to duck or dive under
Water. I alſo find, that to waſh or rince is in <hi>Dutch
Waſſchen ofte Spoelen;</hi> to ſprinkle, <hi>Stroyen ſpreyden ſprenckelen;</hi>
and alſo <hi>Beſprengen</hi> is to ſprinkle, beſprinkle or to ſtrow:
to pour is in <hi>Dutch Gieten</hi> or <hi>ſtorten;</hi> poured upon, <hi>Opgegoten
ofte op Geſtort.</hi> Now ſeeing there is nothing of truth in what
they ſay in contradiction to you of the word <hi>Doop,</hi> but that
it undeniably appears from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Dictionary to ſignify to
dip, to duck or dive, and that it has nothing in its ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
either to ſprinkle or waſh by pouring Water, which
things are render'd by other <hi>Dutch</hi> words: I know not how
they can clear themſelves from the guilt of a wilful Lie to
cheat the People of the true form of Goſpel-Baptiſm, which,
in my opinion, is a greater Sin than to cheat them of their
Mony. And it's greatly to be lamented that any profeſſing
Godlineſs, ſhould ſo groſly ſtain their Religion for the ſake of
Infant-ſprinkling, a meer human Tradition, which has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Command nor Example for it in the holy Scriptures.</p>

                  <p>I have examined this Letter, and find it to agree exactly
with <hi>Hexam's Dutch</hi> Dictionary; and theſe Presbyters have
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:150284:91"/>
moſt baſely betray'd their Ignorance in that Language, and
have made their Reflections to conſiſt of the moſt ſhameful
Forgeries and Falſhoods they could well have invented, both
in this and the reſt of their Accuſations againſt me and
others, as appears by thoſe many authentick and undeniable
Teſtimonies given under the Hands of ſo many Eye and Ear-Witneſſes,
who have alſo (ſome of them) prov'd Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>
to be a moſt notorious Liar to his very face, before divers of
his Hearers, and others then preſent. And had not the Book
ſwell'd too big, there had been printed a large Letter from
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Son, directed to thoſe three Presbyters, wherein
he hath not only juſtified his Father, but my ſelf alſo, from
thoſe vile Reflections they have unjuſtly caſt both upon the
Living and the Dead: But if they offer to perſevere in their
lying Vanities, and groſs Abuſes, they may be furniſhed with
that, and much more, not only from both his Sons, but from
an eminent Perſon living in <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> who hath written
largely upon that Subject, and alſo in Vindication of me and
my True Narrative; who will neither be afraid nor aſham'd
to own what they have written, having given it under their
Hands: And therefore both Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> and my ſelf do beg
their Pardon, that we have omitted to make it publick for
the Reaſon above-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>There are many things which they have aſſerted that are
utterly falſe, which I have not took notice of; but I cannot
omit what they have aſſerted in <hi>p.</hi> 64. of their Partial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,

charge it upon them as a Forgery and Invention of their own,
for I neither ſaid ſo, neither was it poſſible for me to think
ſo. But why ſhould I think it ſtrange for them to belie me,
when Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> hath been ſo bold to belie the Lord Jeſus?
For, after they have mentioned <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 4. in their Printed

And when Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> was examin'd, he declares the
direct contrary: For he aſſerteth, That a certain <hi>Evening</hi> as
he was walking <hi>all alone,</hi> he happen'd to go in at Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi>'s
Houſe, where there was a young Man that told him that he
was ſuſpended, and ask'd his Advice.</p>
                  <p>And now I leave the World to judg of Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> and

                     </gap>ut he ſaith it was in the <hi>Evening;</hi> he alſo ſaith he was <hi>all
alone,</hi> but ſhe ſaith his Wife was with him. But at length
Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> hath confeſt Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> was not there when
the words were ſpoken: This ſhe declar'd to one <hi>Thomas
Whitewood,</hi> which he will make Oath of if call'd thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding they were thus detected, he hath had the
Confidence to publiſh a Poſtſcript to their ſecond falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Diſputation, which is ſtuff'd full of horrid For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries;
wherein he aſſerteth, that I have confeſt to ſeveral,
and ſome of our own Friends (Members of our Communion)
have acknowledg'd, how that I was check'd at our Monthly
Meeting for hearing of Mr. <hi>Webber:</hi> And that when I went to
ſit down at the Sacrament, ſome roſe up and ſaid, If I ſat
down they would not; on which I withdrew as virtually
ſuſpended.</p>
                  <p>I do now utterly deny all that he hath there written; and
I do hereby challenge Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> to produce any Members
of our Communion, that either have ſaid, or will ſay what
he hath written in his lying Pamphlet, and I will give him
the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>But let not Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> think that the preſumptious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of his blundering Poſtſcript is a ſufficient Teſtimony to
prove his invented Lies, by ſaying as <hi>Pilate</hi> did, <hi>What I have
written, I have written.</hi> For, notwithſtanding he would fain
put it off with his ſurly Anſwer, It ſhall not ſerve his turn, I
do here once more charge them upon him as invented Lies;
and therefore let him clear himſelf, or confeſs his Sin, or for
ever bear that Shame, which is the juſt deſert of all ſuch (as
he is) that love and make Lies.</p>
                  <p>He is pleaſed to pray that God would give me Repentance:
To which I ſhall anſwer in the Language of my Saviour to
thoſe of old, <hi>Weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves:</hi> ſo ſay

                  <p>But alas! what will not this Man ſay, whoſe Piety conſiſtet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

more in Eating and exceſſive Drinking, than in Prayer and
Faſting; and his Works more in envious Lying and Slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than in Truth and Charity: For tho none preaches
Charity more than he, there are none uſes leſs than himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor none that have more need of it than he, becauſe he lives
by Charity, and cannot live without it. He is alſo one of the
greateſt pretenders to Learning that ever I knew, altho none
are more unlearned than he; for he hath not yet learned to
ſpeak the Truth of his Neighbours; yet he hath too much
Learning for his Brain, and too little Judgment for his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and his too great opinion of both ſpoils all.</p>
                  <p>He is ſo frequent in the ſpeculation of his own Parts and
Abilities, that he is not at leiſure to take a view of his own
Deformities: His Eyes, like a Drunkard, ſee all things double;
and his Fancy, like an old Man's Spectacles, makes a great Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in a ſmall Print. And as he never fixes his Eyes on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
without Admiration, ſo he never removes them to his
Neighbours without Reflection, calling them Blockheads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
His Diſcourſe is all Poſitions; thus it is, and thus it muſt be;
and as I have written, I have written. But he will not ſo
much degrade his own Authority, as to ſubmit what he ſaith
to Proof and Trial, but you muſt take his bare word for it;
and tho the matter be never ſo falſe, he is preſently in a rage
with all that will not believe his Lies to be true, without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him into queſtion about them. I fear he is one that hath
loſt all good in himſelf, and is unwilling to find it in his
Neighbours: For he and his wicked Avoucher hath bely'd
the Truth, and enviouſly ſlander'd the Innocent: He is an
everlaſting Argument, but I am weary of him, whoſe Religion
is a queſtion, and his Salvation a greater, which Death only
will conclude, and Judgment reſolve; and then all his Lying

And therefore I bid him farewel, till I catch him again (as I
have already done) in his belying of me.</p>
