         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Vpid</hi> hauing taught me what
restlesse passions are in loue,
what continual perturbations
Fancy affoordes to such as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
beauty the principal end
of their affects: hauing recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the wound, I sought where
to find a salue fit for the easing
of my malady: Experience
willing that I should not tye
my thoughts on delay, told me that such as were enueno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the Scorpion, must be healed by the Scorpion,
that the Tarantals sting could not be pulde out without
Musick, that he which was pierced with <hi>Achilles</hi> Launce
must be healed by his Speare, and they which were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with Loue, must seeke to loue, or els lacke remedy:
Wherupon doubtfull what I should doo, I was willed to
sue to <hi>Venus</hi> as soueraigne Goddesse and patronesse of
such perplexed patients. I left my home and sayled to
<hi>Cipres,</hi> there found I men vnknowne, but not her whom
I lookt for: there might I sée <hi>Venus</hi> Pallace like the gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Tower built by <hi>Semeramus.</hi> Sloth being Porter,
sléepy, and suffering frée passage to all, the gate of entrance
was not the way to returne: for at the other side was a
doore to depart, where Beggery stoode and threatned all,
but strooke some with his whip of repentance: within I
found Princes, great Lords and men of meane calling, al
prisoners, some fettered by the eyes, others by the eares,
some by the tong, as hauing more lust in their mouth then
loue in their mindes, none or fewe cheyned by the harts,
and such as were set inthroned in a secret Cell: those <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
shrinde vp as wonders of the worlde, well: missing
what I came for, I past spéedily from thence to <hi>Paphos,</hi>
where <hi>Venus</hi> had onely a Temple, thither came multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
on Pilgrimage, making vowes, vttering oathes,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3564:5"/>
and protesting promises: if they might enioy the fruition
of their Ladyes, to be sworne votaries to the Goddesse:
Some were fauoured, others disgraced: some dispaired,
some hoped, but all found the ende of theyr pilgrimage
was to buy smoake with many perrills and daungers:
But all these instances were no arguments to diswade
me from my iourney: But as <hi>Medea</hi> though I saw the
best and allowed of it, yet I followed the néerest &amp; smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for it, for such as be in loue are like the Déere which
one while strike at the Tamarisk trée with their hornes,
and then gréedily burst on it with their mouthes, others
the people of <hi>Mamaca,</hi> that surfet on Dates, and yet dye
with them in their mawes. Louers exclaime agaynst
<hi>Cupid,</hi> and yet they goe on pylgrimage to <hi>Paphos,</hi> they
call <hi>Venus</hi> vniust, and yet offer her incense and sacrifice,
they fore-sée misery, and yet run headlong on their owne
misfortune. So fared it with mee, for seeing these men
thus deepely passionate, and yet so slenderly rewarded, as
who carried away the greatest trophe, had his ensigne
stamped with repentance: yet their mishaps could not
make me learne to beware, but from <hi>Paphos</hi> I went to
the fountaine of <hi>Alcidalion,</hi> where I heard <hi>Venus</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
the heate of Sommer, was kept close Prisoner by
<hi>Mars</hi> in a Pauillion, but I found the rumour false, yet
did I not repent mee of my arriuall, for there I sawe sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
about the bancks, infinite troupes of faire and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Ladyes, all votaries vnto <hi>Venus,</hi> smyling at the
fondnesse of men, and laughing at the passions of theyr
Louers, making true loue knots of rushes, that broke ere
they could be twisted: some séemed lyke Saintes, those
were subtill and peruerse: others fawned, and those were
flatterers: some wept, and they let fall teares of deceite:
some séemde to haue many eyes, and those had many fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
some two harts, and yet they were very chast: for
some had twenty measuring their Loues by their lookes:
gazing still vpon their countenance and gesture, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3564:5"/>
hard by seperate from the rest a fewe Ladyes sitting
passing solitarie, their names were ingrauen in the trées,
but so long since as hardly I could read them, yet I found
out <hi>Hero, Penelope, Thisbe, Artemesia,</hi> alas a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and disdained by the rest, these had their eyes shut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
beauty, and their eares open to vertue, their harts
subiect to loue, but onely stamped with one Carracter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
the Emeraulde, that neuer looseth the first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
nor admitteth any other: well here I could ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
finde <hi>Venus,</hi> nor heare of her, but scoffinglie those
girles told me, she was either in <hi>Ida</hi> or in <hi>Erecinus,</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to loose no time, I hasted from <hi>Alcydalion</hi> to <hi>Ida,</hi>
where I could see no steps of a Goddesse, but only the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
monument of <hi>Troy</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed to cinders, there I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the end of loue, the reward of lust, the trophes of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
the follies of women in <hi>Helena,</hi> that brought <hi>Priamus</hi>
his sonnes, and so famous a Cittie to confusion. From
thence I posted to <hi>Erecinus,</hi> the Mountaine was greene
and pleasant to the eye, the stones that appeared higher
then the grasse séemed like Iacinthes, the mosse was flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
the very rubbish below pearles, so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature seemd
to haue conquered art, and art nature, and a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
glory both in musing at the gorgeous scituation of
this deuine Mount, looking if eyther there were Palace
or Temple dedicate to <hi>Venus,</hi> I sawe none, but casting
mine eye into the bordring vale, I saw a Shepheard gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of his flockes. Desirous to learne of the man any
newes of the Goddesse, pacing downe from the Hyll, I
went and saluted him in this manner.</p>
            <p>Shepheard, so I name thee for thy flockes, more maist
thou be, for <hi>Apollo</hi> kept <hi>Midas</hi> sheepe, and <hi>Mercury</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the shape of a Heardman: but measuring thy degrée
as present thou seemest, I craue so much fauour at thy
hands, as to tell mee whether <hi>Venus</hi> is resident about
this mount of <hi>Erecinus,</hi> or no, I haue beene at all her pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of abode, and this is the last of all her earthly mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3564:6"/>
This Shephearde hearing me salute him so curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie,
laying downe his pipe and his hooke aunswered
thus bluntly.</p>
            <p>Friend, what I am it little reckes thée, thou seest my
fouldes, and then why standest thou vpon higher titles:
In calling me shepheard or Swaine, thou giuest me my
due, if my degrée be greater, my sheepe may serue for thy
excuse, to thy question: as it sauours of folly, so I thinke
best to aunswer it with silence, yet for I see thy thoughts
to be full of passions, and thy face the map of sorrowes, the
two notes of a Louer, if I knew my counsaile might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
thee, or my experience warne thee, I would bestow a
little wast time while my Sheepe grase so hard, to holde
thee chat.</p>
            <p>Hearing the Shepheard beginning so roughly, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
so gently, willing to be auditor to his Country pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
I aunswered him thus.</p>
            <p>Shepheard, if thou be no better, (for thy talke makes
me suspect higher, Know that I haue tolde many cares,
numbred many passions, felt many sorrowes, vttred ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sighes, shed many teares since <hi>Venus</hi> entertained me,
with Roses at the first, &amp; afterwarde beate me with Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
I haue found loue to be a Laborinth, a fury, a hell,
wherein men aliue féele worse paines then those ghostes
that pay <hi>Charon</hi> hier for his ferriboat: gréeued thus, yet
as one in a lunacie: I neuer fore-sawe my miseries. I
heard many counsailes, and read many preceps, but al in
vaine, yet for that time hath many chaunces, the Fates
their Canons tied to opportunitie. Fortune her decrées

suing to <hi>Venus</hi> for releefe of their passions, but
how she vsed these fond and perplexed patients, as it pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
mee to rehearse, so it wil grieue thee to heare. Those
youthes whose yeeres more then their mindes, are fryed
with a small flame of ordinarie fancie, rather inserted by
nature then inferred by loue, such she entertaineth most
sumptuously, as fittest obiects for her to worke vpon, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
oyle in the flame, fire to flax, and beautie as the bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
obiect to youth, for she knowing the olde verse to bee

excellent by nature, yet far more gorgious by arte:
faire faces, smiling lookes, alluring gestures swéet spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
these are the baites that she layes to intrap, &amp; youth
is so fond that he cannot but taste, resembling the poore
Mouse, that feedeth soonest on the most infectious Rosal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
respecting the colour, not the confection, after once
shée hath gotten youth limed fast on her twigges, then
<hi>Cupid</hi> vseth them as marks, and at euery shoote galleth
to the quicke, that the woundes cannot be cured, till ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we finde remedie by repentance, which oft co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
too late, or haue a quittance by death, which they thinke
commeth too soone. Others, that haue beene stale stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in her Court, spending their time in sighes, teares,
and many dispayring passions, such shée feedeth on with
delayes, giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one day an incarnatiue to heale, and
the next day a contrary medicine to fester, choking theyr
sences with perfumes, and straight stifling them with
Hemlock, suffering theyr Ladies in the morning to wash
their temples with Rose-water, and at night to quaffe to
them gall and vinegar, shadowing smiles with frownes,
sower lookes with wanton actions, fettering them with
the wings of hope, but hanging dispaire at their heeles,
least soaring too hie, they should seaze &amp; catch their pray:

I mean, as shee bestowed vpon <hi>Paris,</hi> yet shalt thou finde,
that she fetcheth all her virgins from the fountain of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydalion,</hi>
(beleeue me Pilgrim I will not warrant theyr
maidenheads) because thou seest they haue many eyes,
and many harts, which haue many fancies, and many

bring out some effects: But leauing these doubts as may
not once haue entrance into Louers thoughts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that all are virgins that come from <hi>Venus,</hi> for
<hi>Diana</hi> hath so few in her traine, that she marries not one

for, he findes not the fairest Christall but hath his staine,
the brightest topar but hath his spot, the richest Gold, but
hath his ore, and the purest creature feminine I meane:
but hath her common imperfection, either proud without
profite, and thats a purgation for the Purse, or fayre
without wit, and that is to marry a woodden picture
with a golden creast, full of fauour but flattering, and
so he may reape many kisses and little loue, shrewish, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull,
wilfull, fond, new fangle, and what not: nay,
perhaps proue so light in the braines, that she make him
swell in the browes, that as he hath beene in his youth a
votary to <hi>Venus,</hi> so in his age he may proue a companion
to <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and Pilgrim quoth the Shepheard, this is to
sitte on the toppe of <hi>Venus</hi> wheele, these bitter sauces be
her cheefest delicates, and these painted Sepulchers her
richest trophies. Thou seest I sit neere <hi>Erecinus,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore

            <p>Hearing the cunning experienced swaine to discourse
so roundly of the matter, I imagined either he had beene
in loue, or an enemie to <hi>Venus,</hi> so that I demaunded of
him if he would not haue men loue at all?</p>
            <p>Yes quoth he, so they count <hi>Dianas</hi> virgins not <hi>Venus</hi>
wantons: I replied she had very few or none, hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
had shée more suters, shee woulde prouide more
maydes, but <hi>Venus</hi> spying them passe towards her Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
layeth such snares to intangle, such traps to intice,
such charmes to bewitch, such dangers to preiudice, that
none or very few ariue at <hi>Dianas</hi> mantion, and such as
doo: come thither halfe maimed.</p>
            <p>Then quoth I, you conclude peremptorily against <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

and with that sitting downe he tooke his pipe in his hand,
and plaid so sweetly, that like <hi>Argus</hi> at <hi>Mercuries</hi> melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

mighty Gods but smile to thinke that when my wife and
her blind Sonne, the one with her boxe of beauties, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his quiuer of Arrowes, passe abroade to shewe
their Deities: what number of poore perplexed men as
Patients come to haue cure of their hurts, some in their

bright a Sunne, and such are blind; some that with <hi>Vlis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
haue not stopped their eares, but haue listened the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi>
and they complaine of their hearing: some in their

none comes without gréefe, nor returne throughly cured,
so that I suppose either the wounds are very perilous, or
my wife a bad Surgion. Truth (quoth <hi>Iupiter</hi>) but what
number of women come hether: Multitudes (quoth <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>)
<hi>Apollo</hi> smoothly and yet with a smile, demaunded

for be the wound neuer so déepe, tis perfectly cured in

or their sores more easie to salue. No (quoth <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>)
it is because their loues are like a mans breath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
bright stéele, which scarse lighteth on before it
leapeth off, or like wood wet in Allom water, which lieth
in the fire and waxeth hot, but neuer burneth: their harts
resemble a Pumice stone, light: &amp; which way soeuer you
turne it: full of starting holes, that if fancy steale in at the
one, he can step out at the other: or els quoth <hi>Iupiter,</hi> their
harts haue no holes at all, but as firme as flint, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fancy nor loue can enter, for <hi>Venus</hi> teacheth them
extremities, eyther to fawne &amp; be too fond, or to be too coy
and too stubborne, which causeth so many to put vp inuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
against her. Least of all (quoth the Goddesse,) in a
great chafe hath <hi>Iupiter</hi> cause to accuse women of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if not, I appeale to <hi>Iuno,</hi> at this all the company smiled
and <hi>Ioue</hi> was silent, well (quoth <hi>Apollo,</hi>) leauing these

not to let so faire a ball fall to the grounde: tooke
opportunitie thus by the hand.</p>
            <p>This present Dittie of <hi>Orpheus</hi> tendeth to our forepas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
discourse, as though the Fates had forepointed our
talke, and this arriuall consequence of their infallible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees:
sith then the vnkindnes of <hi>Euridicae</hi> discouers the
inconstancie of women, &amp; that <hi>Orpheus</hi> hath by his sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
passions made an Anatomy of loue: let vs heare hys
opinion howe hee censures of beautie. <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Iupiters</hi>
motion commaunded <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who not amased (as a
Ghost come from hell) began thus. The Question right
mighty Gods is easie, for that commonly all gaze at
beauty as at the fairest obiect that flattereth the eye, yet
a thing perilous, howsoeuer it seemes precious: seeing
the fairest Lawnes soonest take the déepest staines, the
brightest Beralles the greatest flawes, and oftentimes
the fairest faces with intollerable faults: <hi>Greece</hi> vaunted
not so much of her beautifull paragon, as <hi>Troy</hi> lamented
of their incestuous strumpet, men came to Rome to sée
<hi>Messalines</hi> beauty, but Rome sorrowed that shee was
counted a Harlot: <hi>Thessaly</hi> rung of <hi>Euridites</hi> proportion,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3564:9"/>
but <hi>Thessaly</hi> shamed and <hi>Orpheus</hi> grieued at her bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and yet forsooth though we find beauty thus preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall,
yet we must leape at it, though to our vtter ruine
we light in the ditch: But as the fish Ramera listning to
the sound of the trumpet, is caught of the Fishers: as the
Porcupine standeth staring at the glimmering of the
Starres, and is ouertaken with dogges: as the Leopard
looking at the Panthers painted skinne, is caught as a
pray: so he which taketh too much delight to gaze vppon
beautie, is oft times galled with greefe and misery: yea,
his pleasure shall inferre such profite, and his good will
such gaines, as if hee reapt the beautifull Apples of <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus,</hi>
which are no sooner toucht, but they turne to ashes.</p>
            <p>Beautie no sooner flourisheth but it fadeth, and it is not
fully ripe, but it beginneth to rotte: it no sooner blossom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
but it withereth: and scarcely being toucht, it stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
like the Guiacum leafe, that hath the one halpe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
before the other halfe be perfect, to the Birde <hi>Acau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this,</hi>
which hatched white, yet turneth blacke at the first
storme: Or like to the stone <hi>Astites,</hi> that changeth cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
with the onely breath of a man: this (right mightie
Gods) is my censure of beautie, that vnlesse ioyned with
vertue, it is like the feathers of the Phenix, placed in the
carkasse of a Crow, but where faith and feature are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiues,
that beauty I call diuine and metaphisica, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>gratior est pulchro veniens è corpore virtus.</hi> Thys
discourse of <hi>Orpheus</hi> all the Gods applauded except <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Iuno</hi> brookt it as hauing lost the Ball, and <hi>Venus</hi>
thought it was best to pocket vp whatsoeuer a Ghost out
of hell did tattle, and so I would haue all faire Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to take it: well, so well did the Gods like and allow
of his talke, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> questioned him what hee thought
generally of women: <hi>Orpheus</hi> neither forcing <hi>Iuno</hi> nor
<hi>Venus,</hi> as one that could but goe to hell, boldly made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that their generall sex stood vpon two extreames, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too curteous or too cruell, and that he had made expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3564:10"/>
of both, and which quoth <hi>Iupiter</hi> are the worst? I
note (quoth <hi>Orpheus</hi>) if your question tendes towardes
men, because my particuler instance may be no generall
Example, but this well I wot, crueltie hath the greatest
punishment appointed for it in hell, which may it please
you and the rest of the Gods to be attentiue, I will proue
with a knowne history. The Gods setling themselues in
their seates, shewed by their silence how they lik'd of his
motion, whereupon <hi>Orpheus</hi> began thus.</p>

he wronged me of my wife, that I had frée liberty to passe
into euery seuerall mancion: wherupon one day with my

complaints, but at the last I came to a thicke fogge,
the smoake and stench so deadly and pestilent, as all the

pittifull shrikes, hauing remorse of her passions, I
toucht my Harpe, and plaid, thinking while my musicke
lasted, to make her forget her torments, as I had done the

               <p>I am <hi>Lidia</hi> that renowned Princesse, whose neuer

too bright for the day: rung so strongly out of the
trumpe of Fame, as it filled euery eare with wonder:
Daughter to <hi>Astolpho,</hi> the King of <hi>Lydia:</hi> who thought
himselfe not so fortunate for his Diadem, sith other Kings
could boast of Crownes: nor for his great possessions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
indued with large territories, as happy that hee
had a Daughter whose excellencie in fauour stained <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
whose austere chastitie set <hi>Diana</hi> to silence with a

the Corall highest in his pride vppon the Affricke
shoares, might well be graced to resemble my teeth and

thus the mirrour of the Worlde, and natures
strangest miracle: there arriued in our Court a <hi>Thracian</hi>
Knight, of personage tall, proportioned in most exquisite
forme, his face but too faire for his qualities, for hee was
a braue and resolute Souldiour. This Caualier com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
amongst diuers others to sée the roiallie of the state

downe his staffe, resoluing either to perrish in so sweet a
Laborinth, or in time happily to stumble out with <hi>These<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
He had not staide long in my Fathers Court, but hee
shewed such Knightly deeds of chiualrie amongst the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
lightned with the extraordinary sparkes of a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
minde, that not onely hee was liked and loued of
all the chéefe Péeres of the Realmes, but the report of his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3564:11"/>
valoure comming to my Fathers eares, hee was highly
honored of him, &amp; placed in short time as Generall of his
warlike forces by Land: resting in this estimation with
the King, preferment was no meanes to quiet his minde,
for loue had wounded so deepe, as honour by no meanes
might remedy, that as the Elephants can hardly bee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

allure the wauering eyes of this <hi>Thracian</hi> called <hi>Acestes,</hi>
as the surpassing beautie of the Princesse <hi>Lydia,</hi> yea, so
déepely he doted, that as the Camelion gorgeth herselfe

on the heauenly face of his Goddesse, so long dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the flame, that he scorcht his wings, &amp; in time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
his whole body. Beeing thus passionate, hauing
none so familiar as he durst make, hee fell thus to debate
with himselfe.</p>
               <p>Is it <hi>Alcestes</hi> loue that troubles thee? why thou art a
Souldiour, sworne to armes, not to Armour: to incounter

with <hi>Mars,</hi> but thou seekest to be priuate friend to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi>
away fond foole, to thy Speare and Shielde, manage
thy horse, though héere in a peaceable Countrey: let not
Bées hiue in thy Helmet, rust inblaze the figure of sloath
on thy Armour, or loue call thee her milksoppe, by whom
warre it selfe hath approoued martiall: hast thou forgotte
that which thou suckest out of thy Nurses teate, that to
loue is to loose, and fancie bee it neuer so charie, is meere
folly: for loue how soeuer it bee, is but a Chaos of cares:
and fancie though neuer so fortunate, hath her crosses: for
if thou inioy the beauty of <hi>Venus,</hi> thou shalt finde it small
vantage: if thou get one as nice as <hi>Minerua,</hi> thou mayst
put thy winnings in thine eye: if as gorgious as <hi>Iuno,</hi>
thy account being cast, thy sums will be rated with losse:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3564:11"/>
yea, be shée chast, be shée vertuous, be shée curteous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
rich, renowned, honest, honourable, yet if thou be
wedded to a woman, thinke thou shalt finde in her suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
vanity to counteruaile her vertue: assure thy selfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to liue lesse without disquiet, nor die before thou haue
cause to repent: which <hi>Craterus</hi> the Emperour noted,
when wishing that some sinister misfortune might befall
his foe: he prayed vnto the Gods he might be married in
his youth, and dye without issue in his age: accounting
mariage by this wish, farre more full of preiudice, then of
pleasure. This, yea all this <hi>Acestes</hi> thou knowest to be
true: but suppose it were not, is there not sufficient to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade?
beside, seest thou not? or hath fancy cast such a
maske before thine eyes, that thou wilt not sée? that her
beauty as it is excellent, so it is high seated: both in the
dignity of her parentage, &amp; the selfe conceite of her mind,
to be gazed at, and so honored: not to be reacht at and so
enioyed, thou séest she is little liberall of her lookes, much
lesse prodigall of her loue: she couets rather a God, then
a man: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongst men think she wil aime at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
or sit still as she is: Pride in her greatest pompe sits
inthrond in her eyes, and disdaine in her lookes: that if
she glaunce to so low as <hi>Acestes,</hi> it is rather to grace him
with a smile then to shew him any fauour: beside, fortune
hath opposed her selfe to thy aspiring thoughts, in that
thy good will hath not yet deserued any such guerdon: thy
desire, is farre aboue thy desert: and the poore stay of a
wandring Knight, farre vnfitte for the Princely state of
worthy <hi>Lidia:</hi> But suppose she were pricked in the same
veine, and that <hi>Venus</hi> would friendly instill some drops
of her inchaunted water to mollifie her hart, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke
her Father will neither condiscend to her mind, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to my motion: nay if he should but heare of such reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
folly, as he hath wrought my promotion, so hee would
worke my confusion: and in troth <hi>Acestes,</hi> not without
cause: for art thou so voyde of vertue, or vowde to vice, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3564:12"/>
to requite his liberality with such disloyalty: to returne
the trust which hee reposeth in thée with such treachery:
Tush, Loue is aboue Lord or law, friend or faith, where
Loue buddeth, no Maister is made account off, no King
cared for, no friend feared of, no duty respected: but all
things done according to the quality that is predominant.
Hast thou béene a Souldiour, and dreamest thou of such
doubts? are the courtings of <hi>Venus,</hi> more perrillous then
the incounters of <hi>Mars?</hi> or the deniall of a Lady, worse
then the daunt of a foe: no <hi>Acestes,</hi> be not faint harted as
the North Ilands, where the people <hi>Iberi</hi> dwell foster no
venemous beast, nor the Sea called <hi>Mare mortuum</hi> fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no Fish, so are there no Cowards suffered to arriue
at <hi>Paphos,</hi> she is but a woman, and therefore to be wone:
Then sound on the march, aske not of what degrée she is,
but where she is: these words <hi>Acestes</hi> (carry emphasis)
and are more fit for a Souldier then for a Louer: for loue
is quesie, and if it be ouer-strained, cracketh at the first
wrest: enduring in this doubt, he sat downe déepely ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with melancholy passions; that as he which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of the Goord Nutte, loseth his memory: and as the
Elephant féeding on the Helytropian becommeth sleepy:
so <hi>Acestes</hi> fell into a drowsie kind of contemplature, that
to auoide such cogitations as combred his minde, hee got
him selfe into a Gallery which was built betweene the
Turrets of the house, and there sette himselfe downe as
halfe in a traunce: Loue, that tooke pitty of this patient,
so fauourd him, that he had not sat long in his dumps but
that <hi>Lidia</hi> came thither all alone to be solitary, who séeing
<hi>Acestes</hi> sitting thus sadly slumbring, determined for her
owne recreation to be a little plesant with him, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
awakened him thus.</p>
               <p>Why how now <hi>Acestes,</hi> is it your custome in <hi>Thracia</hi>
to vse slumbers after meat for Phisick? or is it some me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
impression that thus amateth your sences? trust
me at the first I called to remembrance the picture that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3564:12"/>
                  <hi>Zerxsis</hi> drew of <hi>Endimion,</hi> lying vpon the mount of <hi>Ereci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
who leaning his head on his hand, his eyes shutte as
one in a dreame: yet had his face so bedued with distilling
teares, as his outward plaints did sufficiently bewray his
inward passions: and so <hi>Acestes,</hi> in this thy solitary dump?
didst thou resemble <hi>Endimion,</hi> both in countenance and
colour, that had teares fallen from thine eyes as thou
wert in a traunce? I had happily demaunded how <hi>Phebe</hi>
had vsed thee: So apalde was <hi>Acestes</hi> at this sodaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of <hi>Lidia,</hi> that hee sat still as a man depriued of his
sences: till at the last gathering of his wittes together
he start vp, and his due reuerence done, he made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</p>
               <p>I think Madam that melancholy is not particuler ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to person or place, but that being a complexion, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
oft-times the quality of the affection: so that the
mind any way distrest, the body must yéeld in effect to the
most precious part: I confesse therefore, that being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
at my hart, I felt mine eyes heauy, as they which
were the chéefest procurers of my malady: but when I
awoke and sawe your excellency, both your presence and
curtesie greatly daunted my mind: your presence, in daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
mine eyes so suddenly with so solemne an obiect:
your curtesie, in that your Ladyshippe without curiositie
would vouchsafe to talke with so mean a Gentleman: but
I sée the best fruite hath the brauest blossomes: the most
precious stone, is chosen by the most glistering hue, and
the best conditions, by the swéetest countenance: so that
where beauty raigneth, there vertue remaineth: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a faire face resteth a faithfull hart: But whereas you
say you had taken mee for <hi>Endimion</hi> by my penitrature
&amp; countenance, but that I wanted teares to decipher my
sorrow: I answer, that the hottest thunders are not euer
quenched with raine, nor the déepest gréefes euer discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by teares: the stone Garatides fryeth without and
is cold within, the Germander least when it is most full
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3564:13"/>
of moisture, looketh then most dry: where the sea is most
déepe, there it is most calme: &amp; where is the smallest shew
of teares, there oft are the greatest effect of sorrow: For
trust me Madam, I thinke <hi>Endimion</hi> sighing for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his Lady <hi>Luna,</hi> neuer felt more bitter passions
on the mount <hi>Erecinus,</hi> then I suffered in this halfe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
slumber: why (quoth <hi>Lidia</hi>) are you in loue? <hi>Acestes</hi>
at this question fetcht a déepe sigh, as it séemed his heart
strings should haue crackt in sunder, he stood as one in an
extasie, doubting whether nowe hee should take time by
the fore-head, or to defer it till afterward: well, séeing op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
so fit, he boldly tooke hart at grace, and began to
giue this encunter.</p>
               <p>They (Madame) that séeke to stop the swift running
<hi>Volgo,</hi> a Riuer that leadeth into <hi>Persia,</hi> by staying the
streame, maketh the flood flow more fiercely: to represse
the fier, is to encrease the flame: and to conceale loue, is
to smother smoake in the nosethrill, which either wil out,
or els stifleth: wounds fed of with delayes fester, and oft
prooue incurable: fancy long held in the grasse, seldome
prooues a timely Haruest: which makes me to set my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
on the Dice, and either presently to heare the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sentence of my life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the cruell doome of my death.
Since most excellent Princesse, I arriued at the Court
of <hi>Lidia,</hi> so hath mine eyes fed on the beauty of your face,
mine eares wrapt in admiration of your deuine wit, my
mind inchaunted with the consideration of your vertues,
and my hart as the receptacle of all these excellencies, so
deuoted to the substance that contriues such supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
qualities, that the exceeding pleasure, which so long
luld mee in delight, at length suncke so déepe, that they
grew to gréeuous passions: to say all (what I could at
large discourse) in on worde, so long did I gaze at your
beauty, that I was snared, and so long did I admire your
vertue, that now I rest your Captiue: so farre Madame
entred the Laborinth, that either I must perrish with the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3564:13"/>
Minotaure, or els humbly craue your ayde, that the clue
of your mercy may hale me forth of such an intricate dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lidia,</hi> who swelled in choller at these spéeches, coulde
not brooke to heare vp the ende of his discourse, but faring
like angry <hi>Ioue,</hi> who in his rage couereth the beautifull
Skye with a world of stormes, so she incensed with dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
filled her sweet countenaunce with a shaddowe of
bitter frownes, knitting her browes she beganne thus to
reply.</p>
               <p>Why gentle maister Knight, hath too much familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
bredde contempt? are you such a good Phisiognomer,
that you haue insight into my wrincle in the browe and
dimple in the cheekes? I see well if <hi>Apelles</hi> that cunning
Painter, suffer the greasie Sowter to take a view of his
curious worke, hee will growe so malapart as to meddle
with his picture, that he must be thrust into his shop with
<hi>Nae sutor vltra crepidum,</hi> if the proude Centaur <hi>Ixion</hi> bee
bidden to the feast of the Gods, no lesse then <hi>Iuno</hi> herselfe
will suffice him for his choyce.</p>
               <p>Set a Begger on horsebacke, and they say he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
light: extoll one of base stock to any degree of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and who so proud and hautie: I speake this <hi>Acestes</hi> to
thy reproofe, for that my Father hath made thée generall
of his forces, seekest thou to maister him in fortune: will
no dyet downe but my Fathers owne Dish? no meaner
mate suffise vnlesse thou marry with a Prince? Dyd my
Father preferre thee, and now wilt thou presume to bee
his better? haue my lookes beene so louing, my glaunces
so full of good will, as to promise so much as thou doost pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume?
no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the least countenaunce of familiaritie to a
seruile minde, procureth great incouragement: hast thou
euer noted any of my actions so base, that thou mightest
think I would match with a man of thy calling? Haue I
wantond it so euer in thy sight, as thou mightst think mee
fit for <hi>Venus?</hi> But suppose my minde were so fonde, as I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3564:14"/>
would (soring so hie as euer I haue doone) stoope nowe so
low? thinkest thou my Father coulde affoorde thee hys
Daughter <hi>Lidia,</hi> whom he farre priseth aboue his crown?
hopest thou to compasse his consent? No, but if he knewe
of thy daring presumtion, he would repay thy follie with
such punishments, as thy aspiring thoughts doe merrit:
hée woulde vnplume thée of all thy feathers: and like <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops</hi>
Crowe turne thee naked to the worlde: that they
which grudged at thy hastie promotion, might laugh at
thy sudaine fall: if therfore thou loue thine own welfare,
kéepe thy selfe within thy bounds: least in soaring with
the Hobby, to fall to the geound with the Larke: and in
daring with <hi>Phaeton,</hi> thou fal headlong into such infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as thou shalt neuer be able to créepe out of: and with
that she flung away in a great rage, and left <hi>Acestes</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
passionate: so that hee sate him downe againe more
melancholie then he was before: musing aud meditating
vppon the cruell resolution of <hi>Lidia,</hi> slumbring thus on
his harde fortune, vppon a suddaine hee fell into these
tearmes.</p>
               <p>But by the swéete, how should wee know the sower:
the white séemeth most siluer hued when it is adioyned to
blacke: and prosperitie is most sweetest when it hath
beene fore-crossed with aduersity. This principle perhaps
<hi>Lidia</hi> meanes to make me try by experience, thinking to
féede mee first with bitter broathes, that after, dainty fare
may more delight me: for the childing colde of Winter,
makes the Sommers Sun more pleasant: and the frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
lookes of <hi>Lidia,</hi> will cause her smiles to séeme more
cheerefull. Then <hi>Acestes</hi> cease not to pursue thy sute, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
thou finde her more curteous, or resolutely vowed to
remaine obstinate.</p>
               <p>Thus like a valiant Champion, <hi>Acestes</hi> neuer feared
that mislike hung in Womens browes, and into theyr
harts hee could not pry: but hoped the best, and sought for
opportunitie to iterate his sute in this distresse. But For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fortune
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3564:14"/>
meaning plesantly to sport with this young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
would not minister such fitte occasion that hee might
haue sole and solitary accesse to his Goddesse: for <hi>Lidia</hi>
vpon pretended purpose, so warily auoided his companie:
and with such disdainfull lookes rewarded his proffered
dutie, that <hi>Acestes</hi> was faine to aime his course by a new
compasse, and therefore getting into his Chamber, step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to his standish, he wrote her a Letter to this effect.</p>

the passengers that perrish on their shelues, whom they

that you are stung with the <hi>Phalanga,</hi> and so are in loue:
take it the more patiently, for no doubt the serpent was

But alas, your malady cannot be cured but by my

cunning is too small to enterprise the composition of any
secret simples, and my calling too great to become a
Phisition to such a paltring Patient: so that I neyther
can nor will cure any other mans disease by being preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall

cruell: for it is the influence of the starres, &amp; the effectes
of nature that maketh these contrarieties, as hauing op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posde

Panther cannot abide the company of the Ownce, as
the Uulture is mortall enemy to the Eagle, and the blood
of a Lyon &amp; a Woolfe can neuer be mixed in one bowle, so
as impossible it is by requests, be they neuer so ruthfull to
become thy friend, which by the destinies and instinct of
nature am thy mortall foe. Cease then to accuse mee of
cruelty, and leaue off to appeale to my curtesie, for thou
shalt alwayes be sure to finde the one, and neuer to feele
the other: yet least thou should condemne <hi>Lidia</hi> of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
who euer was bountifull to her greatest foes,
though I cannot inwardly mittigate thy misery, yet I
wil outwardly teach thée to apply such playsters, as if

vertue thereof is of no value. He that weareth the fethers
of the bird <hi>Ezalon</hi> about him, shal euer be fortunate in
his loue, but if they be not puld when the Sunne is eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
they are of no force, and to be briefe there is nothing
that sooner driueth away amorous conceits, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to rub the
temples of thy head with the sweate of an Asse, which if
you can performe, as no doubt you may put in practise,
feare not but you shall count my Phisicke authenticall.

noting in his face some extraordinary sparkes of Chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:

Princesse <hi>Lidia,</hi> with all the honour I won in the fielde,
euer vowing to deuote all my thoughts, my actions, and
my Sword and life, as prest to execute her commaunde
and seruice: with that, rising vp, he led the Kinges to the
Princesse, and deliuered them her as her Captiues, shee
coulde not for shame in such a presence, but faine a good
countenaunce, and accept them gratefully: whom shee
forthwith presented to her Father, who entertaind them
as belonged to such Kingly prisoners: all the Nobles ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
their eyes on <hi>Acestes,</hi> as honouring the man for his

I little make account of such pelfe: but rather
make choise of that which I prefer before honour, life, and
land, or all the world, if it should be presented to me: and
that is, the faire and vertuous Princesse <hi>Lidia.</hi> Scarce
had <hi>Acestes</hi> vttered this worde <hi>Lidia,</hi> but the King start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from his seat, turned to his daughter, and asked what
loue was passed betwixt her &amp; <hi>Acestes.</hi> Such (quoth shee)
with a frowning countenaunce, as past betwixt <hi>Iuno</hi> and
the Centaure <hi>Ixion:</hi> I not deny, but before his iourney to

letters, but howe I disdained the motion of so base a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
let the aunswers of his Letters manifest: And

<hi>Acestes</hi> were featurde like <hi>Narcissus,</hi> as couragious as
<hi>Hercules,</hi> hauing as many heroicall vertues as euer had
any, and could present me euery day two Kings for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
till he made me Empresse of the World, yet woulde
I disdaine him, as one vnworthy the Princesse <hi>Lidia.</hi> At
this aunswere, all the assembly abashed, as counting the
Princesse discourteous and ingrate: the King as a man
inflamed with furie, began to prosecute his Daughters
speech in this manner: Presumptuous <hi>Thracian,</hi> vnfitte
with these late conquests, rather obtained by the ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of these Kings, then thy prowesse: for thou hast done
mee seruice, I graunt thee life, but for thyne aspyring

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
thee vpon paine of death, within ten dayes to
depart out of all my dominions, and neuer to approch my
Confines or land. This saide, the King in great choller
rose vp ready to depart, the Nobles were amazed and
greeued, yea, aud grudged secretly at <hi>Acestes</hi> wrong, but
for feare of the King were silent: <hi>Acestes</hi> howsoeuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
vexed, yet shewed no discontent in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3564:18"/>
but with a Souldiers courage pulling of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
said: I am not dismaied at this doome, for that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
greeued at the ouerthwarts of Fortune: what I haue
got in thy Court, I leaue, as disdaining ought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is thine:
the honour I haue wonne, is mine owne, and that thou
canst not depriue me off, and so committing my fortunes
to my deserts, I leaue thee and thy Court: and so soone as
may be thy Country: where if euer I arriue, I dare thee
to doo thy worst: and with that <hi>Acestes</hi> went away, and
the King with the two Kings and the Lords, passed in to
dinner.</p>
               <p>No sooner was <hi>Acestes</hi> alone, but the ingratitude of
the King, the disdaine of his Daughter, the disgrace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by both, so pierst him to the hart, that as such as drink
of <hi>Lethe</hi> become obliuious: so he forgetting the beauty of
<hi>Lidia,</hi> fell to such déepe thoughts of hate and reuenge, that
he enioyned himselfe for a great space to be solitary, that
<hi>Nemesis</hi> and he might consult together how to bring both

and <hi>Cylicia,</hi> was come disguised, and as a stranger into
his Court: the King hearing this, tooke one or two of hys
chéefe Lords, and went to salute <hi>Acestes,</hi> and to giue him
honourable entertainement, such as belonged to so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querer: <hi>Acestes</hi> perceiuing himselfe to be known,
after due reuerence doone to the King, began at large to
discourse to him what seruice he had doone to the King of
<hi>Lidia,</hi> and how hee was rewarded, crauing succour and
supply of his Maiestie, that hee might reuenge with hys
Sworde. The King amazed at such monstrous ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
wondring how such base resolutions coulde harbour
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3564:18"/>
in the hart of Prince, he promised <hi>Acestes</hi> not onely to
ayde him with an army of approoued Souldiers, but in
person to hazard him selfe, both to requite olde iniuries:
and to reprooue in iustice such an abuse offred without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.
This answer of <hi>Sertorius</hi> so contented <hi>Acestes,</hi> that
after great thanks, hee rested in the Court, passing fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
til the forces were furnishing: which no sooner were
ready, but without delay <hi>Sertorius</hi> and <hi>Acestes</hi> marched
merrily forwarde towardes the confines of <hi>Lidia,</hi> as soone
as <hi>Acestes</hi> had sette his foote within the ground of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
King, drawing his Sword, hee swore not to
sheathe it, till hee had made it drunke with the blood of
<hi>Lidians,</hi> commaunding his Souldiers (for <hi>Sertorius</hi> had
giuen him the ordring of the battailes) that they should
vse all extremeties of martiall, burne, sack, spoile Citties,
Townes, and Castles, to cast all to the ground, to take
none Captiues of whatsoeuer degrée or sex, but to put all
to the Sword: men as they were subiects in <hi>Lidia,</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
as the wormes that he most hated: Children as the
issue of them both: the pillage of all should be theirs, only
the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> should haue the Kingdome, and he
would content him selfe with reuenge: this Oration en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he furiously marched forward, and where hee came,
left the Countrey desolate: The King of <hi>Lidia</hi> hearing
this, was driuen into a great agony, but dissembling his
gréefe for feare of discouraging his Souldiers, he leuied a
mighty army, and hasted forward to buckle with <hi>Acestes</hi>
whom he met halfe at aduantage, as hauing most of his
men at pillage: whereupon the <hi>Lidians</hi> taking oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
set vpon the <hi>Armenians,</hi> but <hi>Acestes</hi> so rangde those
that he had, in such warlike sort: that he not only aboade
the braue of his enemy, but entred his battaile, disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his ranckes, and put them to the flight: many were
slaine in that present place, such as escapt and fled, were
met by the Pillages and haruiers of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and
all put to the sword, so that of forty thousand <hi>Lidians</hi> there
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3564:19"/>
scarse remained thirty with the King, who passing vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Country: insconst him-selfe within a strong Castel
with his Daughter <hi>Lidia,</hi> a few faint harted Souldiers,
and all the treasure hee could get: <hi>Acestes</hi> followed his
Fortunes, and leauing <hi>Sertorius</hi> behind with the mayne
battaile, tooke with him ten thousand Horse, and sixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
foote, and made after the King of <hi>Lidia,</hi> as fast as his
men were able to march: comming at last to the Castell
weere he was insconst, first he intrencht a siege round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
and legard it on euery side, then he damd vp all such
springs, wels, and Conduits, as serued the Castell with
fresh water: this done, hee resolued not to loose a man at
the assault, but to make them yeeld by famine. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<hi>Lidia</hi> looking ouer the walls, séeing how her mortall
enemy had girt the Castell with Souldiers, <hi>Armenians</hi>
men there thirsted after blood, and hated both her and her
Father, she fell from thoughts to passions, from passions
to teares: insomuch that she sat her downe, and wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly:
her Father comming vp the batilments, séeing his
daughter in such perplexed estate, finding want of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
and that of force he must be famished: gréefe stopping
his spéech, he sat him downe and bare her company in her
passions: and after consulted how to preuent ensuing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
many coniectures cast: at last they resolued to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselues to his mercy, whereupon <hi>Lidia</hi> decking
her selfe in most gorgious attire, accompanied onely with
two of her Ladies, passed out of the Castell gate, &amp; went
toward the Legar: the Sentonell no sooner had them in
hold, but they were honourably conueyed to the Pauilion
of <hi>Acestes,</hi> who being certified that the Princesse <hi>Lidia</hi>
was attended to speake with him, leapt from his seate,
and went to entertaine her, <hi>Lidia</hi> no sooner saw him, but
she fell downe at his feete: <hi>Acestes</hi> curteeusly tooke her
vp, and setting her in his seate, demaunded her what she<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>craued:
<hi>Lidia</hi> all blubbered with teares, falling downe
on her knées, began thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:3564:19"/>
Mighty <hi>Acestes,</hi> if repentance were any satisfaction
for offences, or sorrowe any salue to couer ingratitude, if
teares might wipe away disdaine, if a Uirgines blood
would pay raunsome for them which haue done amisse:
I would present all these to pacifie the fury of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Sword: but I know such déepe hate of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ingratitude, such desire to reuenge my rechlesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
and the disgrace proffered by both: hath set a fire
the hart of <hi>Acestes,</hi> as nothing may serue to quench such
an ouer heated flame: Oh yet might I finde so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
that my death might redéeme the old man my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if not for the losse of Kingdome, yet of life: and from
falling into the handes of his ancient enemy <hi>Sertorius,</hi> I
should account <hi>Acestes</hi> as mercifull as he is valiant: if
my treaties may not preuaile, as it little behooueth <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes</hi>
any way to fauour <hi>Lidia,</hi> yet graunt me this, that I
may dye vpon thine owne Sworde, that my blood vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
on thy blade, thou mayst be satisfied, and I slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred:
by the hand of <hi>Acestes</hi> so braue a Souldier, might
dye contented.</p>
               <p>No sooner had shee vttered these words, but shee pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
foorth such streames of teares, as made the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
to take pitty of the distressed Princesse: <hi>Acestes</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her vp againe, called for his Sworde, and vnshea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
falling downe at her feete, began thus to make
reply.</p>
               <p>Such déepe impression of gréefe swéete Goddesse, hath
pierced the heart of <hi>Acestes,</hi> in that hee hath lifted his
Sworde against the Lord that harboreth <hi>Lidia</hi> such sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
such repentance, such remorce, in that I haue doone
any thing that might offend the Princesse <hi>Lidia,</hi> whose
deuine presence hath raced out all intent to reuenge: and
so captiuated againe her <hi>Acestes:</hi> that héere franckly he
offreth his conquering Sworde, (that hath atchiued so
many battailes) into the hand of his mistresse to chastice
eyther with death if she please, that daring Knight that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3564:20"/>
hath so déepely offended, and with that he sat as a man in
a traunce: <hi>Lidia</hi> séeing she had brought the Beare to the
stake, thought now so cunningly to muzzle, as she would
kéepe him heereafter for biting: following therefore her
inchauntment, shee fell about his necke, and wette his
chéekes with her teares in such sort, that at last from wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
they fell to kissing, yea so did <hi>Acestes</hi> comfort <hi>Lidia,</hi>
that from melancholy she grew to be somewhat plesant,
the Knight possessed thus of his Lady (as hee thought) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had banqueted her with such delicates as souldiers
can affoord, taking only her hand for pawne of his fafety,
he went with her to the Castell, where they were no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
entred, but the King of <hi>Lidia</hi> with his Crowne in his
hand met <hi>Acestes,</hi> and submitting him selfe, offered both
his diadem and daughter as due to so victorious a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
<hi>Acestes</hi> refused his dignities, but accepting of his
Daughter, embraced her, and entred into priuate and
familier parle: insomuch that choller past vppon both
sides, they began to treate of the marriage, which was
concluded: when the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> returned out of his
Kingdome: wherupon without delay (so feruent was the
loue of <hi>Acestes,</hi>) hee tooke leaue of <hi>Lidia</hi> and her Father,
and going downe to the Legar, raysed the siege, to the
great admiration of all his Souldiers, and from thence
marched to the Campe where <hi>Sertorius</hi> lay: to whom
<hi>Acestes</hi> reueled what had past, and craued that he would
depart out of <hi>Lidia</hi> with sufficient coyne answerable for
his costs: <hi>Sertorius</hi> with a frowning looke tolde him that
in battaile he neuer plaid in iest, and what he had wonne
with the blood of his Souldiers and danger of his owne
person, he would not deliuer vp but by battaile: <hi>Acestes</hi>
whose minde was too haughty to intreat, said nothing, but
secretly stole from the Campe, and trauersing through
<hi>Lidia,</hi> got vp of Horse and Footemen, the number of <hi>sixe</hi>
and thirty thousand, with whome trusting to his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
hee marched closely and secretly to the Campe,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3564:20"/>
of <hi>Sertorius,</hi> where he arriued about midnight, vsing now
pollicy, that before had conquered with prowesse: so that
killing the watch and Sentonell, he past the Courte of
garde, and set vpon the Souldiers, making a great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of such men as were sleepie and amaz'd: yet <hi>Sertorius</hi>
escaped, but <hi>Acestes</hi> passed forward and followed him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Armenia,</hi> where his fortunes so serued him, that hee
conquered <hi>Armenia,</hi> and brought the King himselfe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
to <hi>Lidia:</hi> comming thus in tryumph to my Fathers
court, seating him in greater pompe and possessions then
euer he had, he began to vse his late familiarity towards
me, but I as a woman changed in calling and condition,
shooke him off with more disdaine then before: hee chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
my Fathers promise, who presently commaunded
he should be apprehended and put in close prison: wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thus cauhgt the Lyon in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> snare, my Father questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
mee how I would haue him vsed. I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
on any lesse penaltie then death, my reason least in
letting him abroad, he should fal to his fortunes: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his martirdome I deuised to be famine, as hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to vs by his leager: my Father yeelding him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
into my hands: I prosecuted the matter, causing
euery day for his greater torment, a course or two of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
viands to be carried before the window that looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Chamber, and my selfe to agrauate his sorrowes,
would passe often by his lodging in most pleasant humor.
<hi>Acestes</hi> séeing himselfe thus ouertaken in his own follie,
by trusting too much the teares of a woman, would not
exclaime against the sexe, but séeing no way but death, no
kinde but famine, he resolued to shew an honorable mind
in great patience, &amp; so remained their foure dayes, when,
pinched with extreame hunger almost euen to death: as
<hi>Lidia</hi> passed by, he fell into these passions.</p>
               <p>Meate, meate, oh for want of meate I perrish: Ah
hunger, hunger, the extreamest of all extremeties: were
I amongst men, men would pittie me: amongst beastes,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3564:21"/>
beastes should feede me or feede vpon me. Amidst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pikes
would I venterously escape, or valiantly perrish: on the
land, I could shift: in the Sea, I could swimme: no place
so barren, no people so barberous that woulde not releeue
me or soone ridde mée: euery where more help, no where
lesse, hope, ah hunger, hunger, the extreamest of all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
Thrice cruell <hi>Lidia,</hi> no worse I will tearme thée
for that once I loued thee: not suffering mee to liue, nor
simply to dye: my head is giddy, mine eyes dazell, fallen
are my cheekes, and my tonge die my words, my sinewes
shrinke, my blood consumeth, all my limmes fainte, and
my hart failes me: euery minute I die, and I with I dyd
but die: too long am I out of the way, to bee well out of
the way: Ah hunger, hunger, the extreamest of all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Liuia,</hi> haue I deserued thus to bee doone vnto, I
gaue thee Crownes, and thou wilt not giue mee a crum:
I bestowed Kingdoms on thy Father, aud hee presents
me with famine: thus Loue wrought the traine, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
nay mine owne folly performed the treason: yet
this hope I haue, that he hath found me, is hee that
hath fashioned mée, who though he scourge mee, will yet
saue me, how be it my God I cannot but cry, ah hunger,
hunger, the extreamest of all extremeties.</p>
               <p>What is it I would not rather be, then thus bee? then
thus, ah then thus in pined walles to attende so bitter a
death? I faint, alas I faint, my harts anguish commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
my tongues silence: then <hi>Acestes</hi> silently be patient,
patiently be penitent, penitently perrish, and that last
martirdome will be thy least miserie, because longer thou
shalt not cry: ah hunger, hunger, the extreamest of all
extremeties.</p>
               <p>This complaint highly contented <hi>Lidia,</hi> so that shee
departed and tolde it to her Father, reioycing that her
deuised fourme of death sorted to so bitter euents: well
another day past, so hungry grew <hi>Acestes,</hi> that he greede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3564:21"/>
fed on the flesh on his armes, spilling that bloode with
his own teeth, which before he had so prisde in many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes:
which when hée had done, readie to giue vp the
ghost, seeing the bare bones of his armes, he fell into this
last complaint: Miserable wretch euen in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée,
miserably with my teeth haue I tyred on mine own

hardly giues passage to a few, and my farewell wordes,
<hi>Lidia,</hi> ah <hi>Lidia,</hi> wherof is thy hard hart formed? that the
sting of such diresse cannot peirce it, hast thou the eares of
a woman to heare my cries, and not the hart of a woman
to pitty my case? Ah <hi>Lidia,</hi> he that loued thee, for that hee
loued thee must die: he that sounded thy praises in sundry
Prouinces, him hast thou pinned and pined vp, till those
armes are bare from flesh, that in many battailes bruted
thy fame: I will not curse; thou art <hi>Lidia,</hi> nor exclaime
at my last date thou wert my loue: nor pray for reuenge,
sith at my death my patience shall giue my soule the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
passage. But fondly, how short a time haue I to speak
and yet how foolishly I speake, to name my earthly God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
when I shoulde pray to my heauenly God: the one
hath consumed me, the other must saue mée: now comes
the touch, my hart yeeldes to him that framed it, now the
last bitter sweete pang of death endes what the malice of
man hath inflicted, and so falling downe, he died.</p>
               <p>As soone as I perceiued hee was dead, not yet content
with reuenge, I caused his body to be hang'd in chaynes,
that the world might see the trophée of my crueltie: The
manner of his death beeing knowne, the Nobles and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Commans began to murmure that so braue a
warriour who had made foure Kingdoms tributories to
<hi>Lidia,</hi> shoulde so ingratefully perrish through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> malicious
disdaine of a woman, yea, so farre it pierced into the hart
of <hi>Selidon</hi> great Duke of our realme, that suddainly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a mutiny, he summond most of the Nobles, &amp; told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
such a tirant was too heauy for them to beare, to be short,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3564:22"/>
the Nobles agréed, the Commons of their free will came
in flocks to reuenge, so that he had quickly leauied an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of an hundred thousand men, and entred into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
tooke mée and my Father prisoners, whom hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to be famished in the same place where <hi>Acestes</hi>
ended his life, there without remorse we dyed, they tooke
downe the body of <hi>Acestes,</hi> and buried him with princelie
funerals, and ouer his tomb, for that he attempted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge:
they crowned <hi>Solydor</hi> King of <hi>Lidia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS soone as she had ended her tale, she fell to her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
cryes and shrikes, not answering to any question,
so that I left the place and returned backe with my Harp:
<hi>Orpheus</hi> hauing thus discoursed, <hi>Iupiter</hi> asked <hi>Venus</hi>
how the liked of the tale: marry quoth shée, as of one that
<hi>Orpheus</hi> tells, comming out of Hell: nothing preiudicial
to my Dietie, sith shee was enemy to loue, and of so au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere
chastitie: it rather toucheth <hi>Iuno</hi> or <hi>Diana,</hi> the one
stately in her lookes, the other too chary in her thoughts:
for my part so I dislike of her disdainfull crueltie, as if I
might haue censured, if possible it might haue béene, shee
shoulde haue had a more bitter death vppon earth, and a
more pinching paine in hell: Truth quoth <hi>Mercurie,</hi> for
perhaps the paine is not so great to remaine in the fogge,
as the remembrance how faire once shee was, and nowe
to haue all smeared with the smoake: I think when <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
was a maid, she was more charie of her face then her
maidenhead: and more warie of her beauty then her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie.
These quippes quoth <hi>Mars</hi> are digressions, but
leaue <hi>Venus</hi> and talke of <hi>Lidia,</hi> whose life was so strickt,
whose hart so opposde to loue, whose thoughtes so full of
pride and disdaine, as her instance serueth rather to bée
produced for a wonder, then for example to condemne
women, sith the world I thinke containes not one so bad:
<hi>Apollo</hi> smiling said, Well taken <hi>Mars</hi> for you owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
women must be pleasde, and <hi>Venus</hi> will frowne
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3564:22"/>
if she be not flattered: <hi>Vulcan</hi> sits fast a sléepe, or else I
would not haue spoake so broad before, but to drink down
all the frumps, <hi>Ganimede</hi> (quoth he) fill in Nectar, so the

                  <hi>Arion</hi> standeth in his song as well to defend, as he to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
accounting women the wealth of nature, and farre

commaunded him to shewe his opinion, where-vpon
<hi>Arion</hi> began thus.</p>
               <p>No sooner right mighty Gods, had nature in her curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
moulde formed the counterfeite of Beauty, but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vpon her workmanship, shee fell in loue with that
metaphysicall excellency, as <hi>Pigmalion</hi> did with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of his owne Art: which may assure vs, that it is
most exquisite, wherein curious nature taketh such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
delight: this glorious <hi>Idea</hi> drawne out from the
secret temper of the graces nature, bestowed more prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
vpon women then men, as creatures more worthy
and excellent: the richest gold hath the rarest colour, the
purest stones are most cleare, the sweetest Flowers most
pleasing to the eye: and women as the purest quintissence
circolated from all other liuing things, are therefore the
most beautifull and faire: yea in their own sex, beauty is
the touchstone of vertue, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fairer a woman is, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of good conditions: for such as nature hath either slipt
ouer with negligence, or made in her melancholy, so that
they are ill fauoured and deformed eyther in face or body:
such I holde as a principle to be counted stigmaticall, as
noted by nature to be of a bad constitution: then must we
confesse that beauty is excellent, as the pride of nature:
deuine, as fetcht from the Gods: glorious, as the delight
of the eye: pleasing, as the content of the hart: and to be
estéemed aboue all things, as the very couer and superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
vnder which vertue lyes hid: if then men séeing such
heauenly obiects, such swéet Saints, haue their eyes fixed,
their minds fettered, their thoughts inchanted with their
loues, are they to be blamed or not? rather to be thought
of Heroicall conceite: that place their liking on the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3564:23"/>
of beauty, and to be counted men of great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that in their desires séeke to covnite themselues to
such an excellency: for may not he which enioyeth a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Lady, boast that he possesseth at command? by spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a few yéeres in wooing, some part of his liuing in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
his dayes quiet in sighs, his nights sléep in teares,
by these toyes and a few other passions, he possesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
of that creature which the graces and nature had
studied many ages to make excellent: yet there be some
such satiricall copes-mates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that spare not to raile against
them, calling them the imperfection of nature, saying
beauty is vanity, and the signe of little honesty, noting
women as waspish, froward, deceitful, toyish, light, sullen,
proud, inconstant, discurteous, cruell, and what not: such
as can afford them no better spéeches, I would haue either
made Euenuches or <hi>Esseni</hi> or plaine Asses, neuer to be
fauoured of women, but to be accounted as stoicall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
vnfit to attend on such beautifull and vertuous
creatures: for in my opinion swéete and simple soules:
they be pleasant, open harted, far from deceit God wote,
as bearing all their owne secrets both graue, and yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
many mad and merry tricks to pleasure men, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
&amp; lowly, submitting themselues to what their friends
will lay vpon them: constant, as neuer to be turnd from
their opinions: kind enough, and to be short, as full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
qualities, as the precious stone Silex is full of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
vertue, and this right mighty Gods is my opinion of
women: The Gods smiled at this censure of <hi>Arion,</hi> and
wished him if he could to proue it with an instance as <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi>

the most perfect musition in <hi>Thece,</hi> and musing at

but vpon commaund, that all Dukes, Earles,
Barrons, Knights, and other Gentlemen, should with
their wiues and children, for the more magnificence be
present: which strickt Edict, was so straightly obeyed of
all, that at the day appoynted, none failed to be present:
there appeard in the Kings Pallace such troups of Lords

me clad in my rich robe, with mine instrument euen

of my fortunes: wherat they were all driuen into a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
admiration, after long gazing on me, as at a man
reserued to some higher or more hatefull destiny, they
sate downe in the great Hall to dinner: beeing placed by
the King him selfe and his Sonne, who then playde the
Marshall of the Hall: the yong Prince, whose name was
<hi>Philomenes,</hi> giuing greatest attendance where hee sawe
the fairest Ladies: as hauing his eye drawn rather with
beauty then chiualry, at last he espied a lampe that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all the rest, or rather disgraced them: as <hi>Phebe</hi> dooth
the little fixed Starres: for so farre she surpast the other
Ladies in excellency, as she did in dignity: and by birth

him with: feeding thus his eye, his fancy &amp; his thoughtes
with contemplation, hee lost his stomacke to gorge with
the Camelion on the ayre: sure was that messe where
<hi>Argentina</hi> sat, to haue what attendance the Prince could
grace them with: but their seruice was so broken and so
ill sewed, that either they must coniecture the Prince to
bee no cunning seruitor, or els that his hart was on his

almost forgotte the time of the measure: but calling his
wits together, he led formost till the musick ceast, &amp; then
wringing her by the hand, he whisperd to her thus. I see
Madam that all these Lords and Ladies present, frolicke
themselues as fitting the time, and feeding my Fathers
delightful humor: my silly selfe onely excepted, who thys
day giuing mine eyes leaue to banquet on your beautie,
commanded my stomacke to fast and pray, that my heart

the simplest plaine song, that your descant might séeme the

of a Prince, &amp; to take them for fauours, for Kings wordes
may not offend, if in wrath, much lesse in iest: might your
handmaide dare to reply, in my opinion howsoeuer your

they the more satisfied: for your harts surfeite I will bee

               <p>Beléeue me Lady, if you take my talk for a iest, you haue

<hi>Argentina</hi> then it becommeth thee to tread a degrée farre
aboue thy fortunes, a star to high for thée to gaze at. Kings
as they are men before the gods, so are they gods before
men: such high personages as wee must honor with our
lookes, not attempt with our loues: Why but <hi>Argentina</hi>
he loues thee, he is inamored of thy beauty, hee sues with
wordes, and intreates with his eyes: What then: can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
such great Princes be sooner pensick then passionate:
weare fauour in their mouthes, when they haue flatterie
in theyr harts: Dooth not loue hang in their eye-lyddes,
which as it is taken in with euery looke, so tis shaken off
with euery winke: is not their fancies like the Somers
dew, which scarce wetteth the grasse before it bee dryed
vp with the Sunne? take heed <hi>Aagentina,</hi> Princes haue
liberties and priuiledges, they can laugh out faultes,
which wee must pay with pennalties: Wee hold <hi>Venus</hi>
for a Goddesse, they neuer offer her incense nor sacrifice:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3564:26"/>
and yet they no sooner craue, but she is ready to graunt:
yea but hath sworne ah fond foole, <hi>Periuria ridet Amantum
Iupiter:</hi> Louers oaths are like fetters made of glasse that
glister faire, but couple in restraint: if swearing had made
loue perfect, <hi>Carthage</hi> had possest <hi>Eneas</hi> for their King:
<hi>Phillis</hi> had not hangd her selfe, nor <hi>Medea</hi> said <hi>Deteriora
sequor,</hi> yet men must be credited, els shall loue be a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow:
talkt of, but not put in execution: all are not Sons
to <hi>Anchisis,</hi> nor brothers to <hi>Iason,</hi> nor traitors like <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon:
Philomenes</hi> face bewraies his faith, &amp; me thinkes
his looks containe loyalty: Thus poore wench doo I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my selfe to the best, whereas perhaps he meanes
but to sport with me to make triall of my wit, well if it be
so, I wil endeuor to loue him lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I doo, but if he mean
truth, I will labour to loue him more then I haue done:
and with this she rested content, &amp; went abroad to find out
the rest of the Ladies. <hi>Argentina</hi> had not serued her selfe
thus in secret, but <hi>Philomenes</hi> was as solitary: for getting
himselfe vp into his Study, then setting down his head on
his hand, &amp; his elbow on his book, he began thus to debate
with himselfe. <hi>Philomenes</hi> thou hast read much &amp; reapt
litle, that at one look hast learnd more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in seauen yeres
study thou couldst discouer: <hi>Hermes</hi> told thée that beauty
was a star, whose influence had sundry effects, this was
Allegorical, &amp; thou didst only passe it ouer for a principle.
<hi>Auicen</hi> said that loue was a fury, how didst thou estéeme
of this but as an axiome: <hi>Epictetus</hi> called <hi>Venus</hi> the rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
planet, thou tookest this for a dart: &amp; Amphibological
Aphorisme comments thou hadst none, and conceiue thou
couldst not: but now if <hi>Hermes, Auicen,</hi> or <hi>Epictetus</hi> want
interpreters, let amorous Schollers be auditours to my
precepts: for I haue found beauty a star, and haue gazd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it: Loue is a fury for it is full of passions, &amp; <hi>Venus</hi>
a restlesse starre, for since the Goddesse distilled into my
thoughts her precious Balms, the opperation hath béen so
mighty, as my greatest rest hath béene restlesse disquiet,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3564:27"/>
what néed these ambigues, this schollerisme, this foolery,
thou art in loue with <hi>Argentina,</hi> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders daughter
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> a Duke, but thy Subiect: why then doost thou
vse preambles &amp; protestations? canst thou not say flatly I
am in loue, <hi>Venus</hi> Cofers when they haue the greatest
found, are alwaies most empty: &amp; louers when they prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
most, are thought either great talkers, or déepe flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:
then <hi>Philomenes</hi> discouer thy mind, <hi>Argentina</hi> is a
woman, &amp; therfore to be wooed, &amp; so to be won: Kings may
command, where poore men cannot intreat: tis better to
name a crowne then to write a Letter: an ounce of giue
me, is worth a pound of heare me: the name of Quéen is a
great argument, &amp; therfore feare not: thou hast as much to
be liked, as she to be loued. Thus far wel <hi>Philomenes,</hi> but
suppose she hath already setled her affection, &amp; hath made
choise of some other: séeke not to diuert her, for she that is
faithles to one, will be constant to none, if thou loue her,
wish her not to be disloyall, but rather paune thy life, then
disparage her honor, &amp; wrastle with Loue, whom if thou
subdue: thou extéemst a glorious conquest. In this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he flung out of his chamber, and passing into the priuy
Garden, there he found all the Ladies sparfeled abroad in
sundry borders, som gathering flowers, others in discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the excellency of the place, some in prattle with the
birds, all busie, none idle: taking thus a superficial view of
them all, as hauing his eye wandring for a fairer obiect:
he passed forward to finde out if it might be the Lody <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentina,</hi>
whom he spied with her mother in a shady walke
of the Garden: seeing non but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two, thither went <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
&amp; saluted them in this maner: Honorable Dutches,
well accompanied with your faire daughter, the Mother
happy for bearing so swéete a creature, &amp; <hi>Argentina</hi> fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from such a parent: your walking in this
shady Arbour resembles <hi>Latona,</hi> tripping with her train,
<hi>Diana</hi> in the Lamns, where hauing her self tried the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes
of <hi>Esculapius</hi> her husband: she schoold her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3564:27"/>
so that <hi>Diana</hi> vowed perpetual chastity: I hope Lady
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke <hi>Pelopidus,</hi> brooks not company with <hi>Escula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
&amp; therfore you néede not nusle vp your daughter in such
heresie: The Dutches hearing the yong Prince so plesant
being her selfe a Lady of merry disposition, made him this
answer. Lord <hi>Pilomenes,</hi> were I <hi>Latona</hi> indéed &amp; as was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
in minde, as ready as she to reuenge: I would cause
<hi>Phebus</hi> to chastice your frumps as he did the sons of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bae,</hi>
in loding my back with such reuerence, &amp; my daughter
with such beauty, to your strange supposition, as far as
<hi>Pelopides</hi> differs from <hi>Esculapius:</hi> so far was mine from
<hi>Latonas</hi> perswasion, so beléeue me sir, if Roses be not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in the bud, they either wither or proue windfalls:
Maids must be married, least they be marred: if they be
coy &amp; sweare chastity, they oft wish and wil with secrecy,
youth is the subiect of loue, &amp; Siens that are grafted yong,
haue the surest ioynts, therefore so far am I from that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere
peruersnes of some mothers, that as yong as <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
is, if there were a man whom she could loue &amp; we like
of, they should neuer break off for yeeres. <hi>Philomenes</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
how the Dutches desembled not, began thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:
&amp; what manner of man should he be that might both
content you &amp; please your daughter? the one measuring by
age, the other be youth: I would haue him, quoth the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
to be of age answerable to my daughters yéeres, and
his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage proportioned to his parentage, least inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of time or birth might bréed mischeefe, his personage
such as might féed her eye, his vertues such as might plese
vs both, his liuing answearable to all these, &amp; him would
I count a fit husband for <hi>Argentina.</hi> A right conclusion
quoth <hi>Philomenes,</hi> for there is no match y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is right made if
pelfe conclude not the premises: if he had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> age of <hi>Adon,</hi>
the honors of <hi>Hercules,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Theseus,</hi> the vertues
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>boy, yet <hi>si nil attuleris ibis Homere foras,</hi> if he haue not
liuing, al his loue is laid in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dust: but what say you <hi>Arge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,</hi>
in faith let me as your gostly father, haue you at shrift
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3564:28"/>
before your mother, tel me were you neuer in loue: <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentina</hi>
blusht &amp; was silent, as one that durst not be bold
before her mother: whereupon <hi>Philomenes</hi> said, see Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
tis your presence makes your daughter so squemish,
I pray you pratle with some other of the Ladies, &amp; giue vs
leaue a litle to be secret héere in this walk, perhaps I wil
be a suter to your daughter, what say you Madam, shal I
haue your good wil? I, &amp; my good word my Lord quoth she,
if you meant earnestly: &amp; with that smiling she went her
way &amp; left them to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: <hi>Philomenes</hi> seeing himselfe
thus alone with his Goddesse, thought to take hold of her
mothers last words &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to driue his insinuation thus.</p>
               <p>You heare swéet Saint how fauourably your Mother
speakes, now Madam what censure shall I haue at your
hands? I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not paint out many passions, not tel tales with
such large periods as many vse to doo, but I wil court thée
and woo thée in one word, &amp; that is <hi>Argentina</hi> I loue thée,
more I cannot promise, and so much I will performe by
the faith of a Prince: <hi>Argentina</hi> séeing <hi>Philomenes</hi> speak
so plainly, &amp; therfore as she thought so faithfully made this
answer: my Lord, you take the antecedent of my mothers
answer for a fouor, but you leaue out the consequent: and
that is if you meane in earnest, for I cannot thinke youe
grace would look so low as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Argentina,</hi> but rather gaze
at some glorious princesse, whose Maiesty might match
<hi>Iuno,</hi> whose worthines <hi>Pallas,</hi> whose beauty <hi>venus,</hi> &amp; with
these might bring for her dowry a Diadem: but? &amp; with
that <hi>Argentina</hi> staid &amp; blusht: which <hi>Philomenes</hi> espied,
&amp; therfore wringing her by the hand said: but, what Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
nay forward with the rest or you proffer me great
wrong: why then my Lord, quoth she, and with that shee
gald him with a glance: but if your honor would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to fauor such a simple maid, as from a meane Lady to
make her a Quéene: for other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mariage I dare sweare
your Lordship dooth not intend: your Father gracing our
loues with his Kingly consent, though I could not with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3564:28"/>
loue sufficient request loue: as in person &amp; parentage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for your highnes, yet would I with obedience and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
make supply of these defects which otherwise were
wanting. This answer of <hi>Argentina</hi> so contented <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
as that hee stoode as a man in a trance, at last hee
tooke her hand in his, and swore, that before the feast were
ended he wold make her princesse of <hi>Corinth,</hi> let this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fise
<hi>Argentina,</hi> qd. he, &amp; with that he sealed vp the bargain
with a kisse, and walked towardes her Mother, to whom
he deliuered <hi>Argentina</hi> thus: Madam here I deliuer your
daughter as safe as I receiued in outwarde appearance,
but how I haue schoold her, time will make trial, perhaps
we haue strooke the match, and therfore let the Lorde <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidus</hi>
prouide a good dowrie, and with that he went his
way: when the matter comes to that effect my Lord, you
shall haue a dukedome with her: at that the Prince turnd
back and said, thats mine already, and her Father is like
to bee my subiect, and so to holde his liuing in cheefe: the
Dutchesse smilde, &amp; thus they parted. But leauing <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
to the King his Father, who hauing noted as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
as his sonne, the beauty of <hi>Argentina,</hi> had great ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Lady, so that he made inquirie of those which
were <hi>Pelopidus</hi> neerest neighbours, what disposition the
virgin was of, they all affirmed to the King that shee was
so vertuous, humble, curteous, and adorned with such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
qualities, as the fourme of her life was a methode
wherby other Gentlewomen did direct their actions. The
King hearing this, resolued in his minde there coulde not
be a fitter match for his Sonne, whervpon determining to
break with the yong Prince, as he was in this humor, hée
met <hi>Philomenes</hi> whom he tooke aside, and began to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him as concerning <hi>Argentina,</hi> whether hee could fancy
the Lady or no. <hi>Philomenes</hi> afraide the King had espyed
their loues, made answer, that he neuer tooke such narrow
view of her that he could yéeld his iudgement with affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
then doo qd. the King, and giue me within two daies
an answer, and so he departed. <hi>Philomenes</hi> ioyfull of this,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3564:29"/>
no sooner met <hi>Argentina,</hi> but he told what motion his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had made, but to make a smal haruest of a little crop:
<hi>Philomenes</hi> at the two daies end so answered his Father,
that the King breaking with the Duke, it was concluded
that the end of the feast should be the beginning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
which was such a ioy to the nobles to see their yong
Prince allied in his owne Land, that they deuised newe
Iustes and pastimes, continuing the feast many dayes to
their great ioy, and the Louers most happy content: The
mariage and the feast thus finished, the Nobles departed,
<hi>Pelopidus</hi> leauing his daughter thus honorably espoused,
took this leaue, the maried couple staying still with the old
King in his Court, who being of great age, liued not long
after, but paide his debt vnto nature, so that <hi>Philomenes</hi>
was crowned King of <hi>Corinth:</hi> Liuing thus happily with
his wife <hi>Argentina,</hi> thinking his degrée too high for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to preiudice, it so fell out, that <hi>Marcion</hi> the King of
<hi>Sycilia,</hi> hearing that his ancient enemy <hi>Philomenes</hi> father
was dead, thought to try what mettall was in the sonne,
to proue if he were as valiant and fortunate as his father,
therfore he leauied a great Army &amp; prouided a great fléete
to saile to <hi>Corinth,</hi> which was no sooner rigged but he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
his men, and as soone as wind &amp; weather woulde
permit, sailed towards <hi>Corinth,</hi> where arriuing in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
place, as politick to land without any great resista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
he vnshipt his men, and all his furniture for war: and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Nauie ride in the road, hee marched forward into
the maine land, vsing as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> intended a conquest, fire &amp;
sword, <hi>Philomenes</hi> hearing by Postes how <hi>Marcion</hi> was
landed with a mighty Hoast, and had spoiled many of his
prouinces, started vp, &amp; summoning his Lords about him,
raised a mighty hoast, such as neuer King of <hi>Corinth</hi> dyd
before him, and with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marched to meet with <hi>Marcion,</hi>
whom he incountred by the Riuer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> runneth by the great
plaines called the <hi>Corinth</hi> downes: then pitching his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilion,
he intrenched his Army, and so had <hi>Marcion</hi> forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his: lying thus a while, at last by Heralts they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3564:29"/>
vpon a day of battaile, which once come &amp; both the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
rangd: they ioynd battaile so furiously, the one to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
the other to defend: <hi>Philomenes</hi> hart made one with
equitie, the other with dispaire, that a long while y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fight
was doubtfull, till at last fortune allotted the best to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
in such sort that the fielde was his, the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
most slaine, some fledde, the King valiantly fighting, taken
prisoner: <hi>Marcion</hi> triumphing in the victory, marched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
to the Citty leading <hi>Philomenes</hi> as his Captiue:
comming to the gates, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cittizens yéelded vp the keyes, &amp;
he as a valiant conquerour entred, &amp; passing into the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
found there the Queene all blubbred with feares, as
a woman almost sencelesse, whom he comforted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> custodie of one of his Duke: seated thus vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
in <hi>Corinth,</hi> he not onely disgraded the King from
all dignitie, but disrobing him, commanded that he should
be turnd out of the pallace, and that he should not be relée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vpon paine of death, but if he would haue any thing to
satis-fie his thirst, he should gette it with his handythrift:
<hi>Philomenes</hi> not abashed at this doome, intreated the King
to be good to his wife, and so went and became a labourer
for day wages, contented with this fortune: <hi>Marcion</hi> the
next day sent for the Queene, who although forlorne with
teares, yet nothing her narrowly, hee found her the fayrest
creature that euer yet in his life he had viewed, so that hée
fell extreamly in loue with her, and offered her what ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
or pleasure shee would haue, courting her with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
faire promises and amorous conceits, but all in vaine,
for shee was resolued whatsoeuer fell, life or death, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none
to her but her loue <hi>Philomenes: Marcion</hi> captiuated in her
beauty, was restlesse, féeling such strange &amp; vncouth passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that at last he fell into these termes.</p>
               <p>What fond motions <hi>Marcion</hi> are these that disturbe thy
mind? what childish thoughts vnfit for a king, a souldier,
nay for one that hath conquered both a Crowne and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
thou camst from <hi>Sycilia</hi> to be victor, &amp; heere thou art
arriued &amp; not vanquished, thou hast beaten <hi>Philomenes</hi> in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3564:30"/>
battaile, &amp; art brought vnder by his wife in loue, thy reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
was to terrifie thy foes with thy sword, so thou hast
don, but faine to please a woman with thy tongue: by this
fond foolery I may note, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Venus</hi> frowne is of more force
then the weapons of <hi>Mars,</hi> that affections are harder to be
supprest then enemies to subdue: that loue is aboue King
and keiser, where <hi>Cupid</hi> commaunds, there dignity hath
no priuiledge to withstand: then <hi>Marcion</hi> yéelde, sue and
intreat, but whom, the wife of <hi>Philomenes</hi> thy captiue, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commaund her, and what shee will not yeelde by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
take by constraint: in so dooing should I reape in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
and forced loue is neuer swéete: no <hi>Marcion</hi> allure
her with wealth, promise she shal be thy paramore, to seat
her next thy selfe in thy kingdome, women are won with
fauors, and there is none so chast but time and gifts may
intice. In this resolution he sent for <hi>Argentina,</hi> &amp; beganne
thus to deliuer his minde vnto her. Thus seest <hi>Argentina,</hi>
how I haue fauourd thée, no like a Princesse that were
captiue, but euen as a Quéene that is sole mistres and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
of my affections, thy beauty hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered that
hart which had made conquest of thy Country, &amp; subdued
him who before, womans feature neuer vanquished: then
<hi>Argentina</hi> take pitty of him that for thy loue is so passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
consent that I may enjoy thée as my paramour, and
thou shalt be honourd as shée that is best loued of the King
of <hi>Sycilia,</hi> I could <hi>Argentina</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> seest obtaine by force what
I sue for by intreatie: but I couet rather to possesse my
selfe of thy louely consent, then by constraint: yéeld there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what I request, and héere before the Lords of <hi>Sycilia,</hi>
I promise to grant whatsoeuer thou shall commaund, so it
touch not my Crowne nor thy Husbande, though to the
danger of my person, fréely without exception: <hi>Argentina</hi>
as one nothing dismaid, returnd him this answere: I not
deny <hi>Marcion</hi> thou hast subdued <hi>Corinth,</hi> and deposed the
King, which I attribute rather to his bad fortunes, then
thy prowesse or chiualrie, but in all thy conquest thou shalt
neuer boast thou hast conquered either <hi>Philomenes</hi> or hys
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3564:30"/>
wife <hi>Argentina,</hi> séeing we are only ouercom, not vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
in that both of vs remaine contented, and kéepe our
minds vntoucht: thou art inchaunted with my loue, no
<hi>Marcion,</hi> but perhaps thou art fed with lust, &amp; neuer hope
that <hi>Argentina</hi> will minister any meanes to appease the
flame: although thou shouldst inforce her to consent by the
most extreame torments: <hi>Philomenes</hi> liues, &amp; so long wil
&amp; loue: not thée, but him whom I vowed to be true vnto
for euer: yet thy last condition hath somwhat perswaded
me, that if thou graunt what I request, I will consent not
only to be thy paramour but thine for euer: the king was
so glad of this, that he iterated with an oath to performe
her demauud: then this it is quoth <hi>Argentina:</hi> Tomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
morning thou shalt shut thy selfe into a secret place,
wherof my selfe wil kéepe the key, &amp; there for thrée dayes
thou shalt fast, without tasting any thing so aslake hunger
or thirst: this time thou shalt pray to the Gods for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of our sinns which we shal offend in by breach of
matrimony, then at the terme of thrée days thou shalt frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take the vse of my body before thou eat any meat, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if thou faile but as much as <hi>Proserpina</hi> to taste a
graine of the pomgranet, thou shalt neuer after question
me of loue: thus doo, and I grant to like thée, or els here is
my head, let that pay my raunsom: <hi>Marcion</hi> was so setted
in her beauty, that he thought it nothing to vndertake this
taske, and therfore promised before his Lords to fast three
daies, and then to lye with her before he eat any meat, or
els neuer to motion her any more of loue: whereupon the
next day the Princesse shut him vp till the date was expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
in which thrée dayes he felt such torments, such pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
hunger and extreme thirst, that he cursed loue, and
exclaimed against beauty as a charme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> made men sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
willing to giue for one crum the Diadem of <hi>Corinth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
well the terme expired, all the Nobles were assembled &amp;
sat in the great hall, expecting what euent shold fall either
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings fast, or of <hi>Argentinas</hi> request: at last <hi>Argentina</hi>
sent the key to one of the Lords, that the king might come
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3564:31"/>
into the Hall whether she presently would repaire: the
Lord went to the chamber doore and no sooner put the key
to the lock, but <hi>Marcion</hi> started vp and cryed for meat, the
Lord vnlockt and saw the king glance at him with such a
fierce looke, that he was afraid and started back: villaine
quoth <hi>Marcion,</hi> hast thou brought me any meat, and with
that running as a mad man into the hall, flinging in fury
among the Lords: Why Gentiles (quoth he) sit you héere
without meat? why are not the tables spread? doo I allow
such niggardly allowance, or wil you famish him that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stereth
you all? At this he was in a rage, <hi>Argentina</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parailed
in her richest robes, came pacing, that she looked
more like an Angell, then a mortall creature, insomuch
that euery eye directed their glaunces at so heauenly an
obiect, except <hi>Marcion,</hi> who at her sight sat as a man great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amated: hauing her mayde followe her with a dish of
meat crumd: <hi>Argentina</hi> with a smiling countenance ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him by the hand, sayd thus.</p>
               <p>Redoubted Conquerour, according to promise I am
come in the presence of these Lords to offer my self subiect
to your highnes plesure, ready to goe whither your grace
shal conduct me: <hi>Marcion</hi> at this cried out, &amp; thinkst thou
<hi>Argentina</hi> that famisht men haue minde on beauty, or is
hunger to be satisfied with loue? no, no, tis true <hi>Marcion,
Sine Cerere &amp; baco friget Venus,</hi> reason could not subdue
lust, but fasting hath set it on a non plus: but what is that
the mayde carries? meat my Lord quoth she for your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
after, and with that she blusht: <hi>Marcion</hi> no sooner
heard her name meate, but he leapt to the mayde, puld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the dish, saying: farwel fond loue, and welcome that
wherof one morsel is worth a monarchy, <hi>Argentina</hi> giue
me leaue to eate, for thou hast conquered <hi>Marcion</hi> in his
own folly, and with that he fell to his meat, wherwith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had somewhat appeased his hunger, sitting him in
his seat royal, he began to parle with his Lords of <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinas</hi>
pollicy, highly extolling the constancy of so true a
wife, and so far entred into consideration of the chaunce of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3564:31"/>
fortune, and fall of Princes, that rising from his throne,
he went and embraced and kist <hi>Argentina,</hi> not only prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
her for her redy inuention to perswade him from his
vanity, but for her sake sent for her husband, and yéelded
him his Crowne and his Kingdome, and liuing his sworn
friend, returned home into <hi>Sycilia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NO sooner had <hi>Arion</hi> ended his tale, but <hi>Mars</hi> taking
opportunity, said: we sée by this euent, that as women
haue their vanities whereby to be checked, so they haue
their vertues redounding greatly to their praise: beeing
both affable and constant, although that single instance of
<hi>Orpheus</hi> his <hi>Lidia</hi> did inferre the contrary: And so quoth
<hi>Apollo</hi> would <hi>Venus</hi> serue for an instance if you mean of
constancy, for no doubt if you may be iudge, al beauty shal
be vertue, &amp; all women shal be Saints: &amp; now quoth <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,
Apollo</hi> by your leaue to take <hi>Mars</hi> his part, we oft
rightly to think of women, seeing so oft we seeke their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors,
&amp; speak to them by intreaties for their loues, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we should proue our selues very ingrate: to beat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with rods, that feast vs with banquets, to proffer them
Scorpions that giues vs no worse then their own selues:
Liuely spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quoth <hi>Mercury,</hi> but <hi>Iuno</hi> likes you neuer the
better for this flattery, as supposing you haue sued to more
then contented her, or becommed you: but in my opinion,
<hi>Arions</hi> tale paints out a paragon, a matchles mirrour, as
wel for constancy, as the other for cruelty: these extremes
therfore infer no certain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusions, for they leaue a mean
betwéene both, wherein I think the nature of women doo
consist, neither so cruel but they wil grant, nor so constant
but they will yeeld, &amp; rather oft-times proue too curteous
then too vnkind: Sée quoth <hi>Mars</hi> how péeuishly you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
to taunt them still of vnconstancy: well <hi>Mercury,</hi>
quoth he, thou art subtill, &amp; canst by thy fallacions prooue
what thou wilt: but yet this I set down for mine own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that women the more beautiful they are, the more
curteous, the more constant, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fuller of excelent qualities:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3564:32"/>
and rather vertues, and by the Riuer of <hi>Stycks</hi> I swere,
and with that he rose in a choller, this I will approoue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him that dare maintaine the contrary: though not
with my pen, yet my sword: at this the Gods smild, and
<hi>Mars</hi> in such a rage clapt his hand on the boord: that I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woke,
not knowing what became of the Gods or of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
soule, only I remembred their tales.</p>
               <p>BEing thus awakt, I lookt about mee, and still sate my
Shepheard: how now good fellow, quoth I, haue I not
taken a lusty nap? thy Pipe sounded so swéetly, and there
I had such a dreame as I would not haue lost for much,
for I hope it wil after more profit me then all my iourny,
I haue past to <hi>Erecinus:</hi> I am glad quoth the Shepheard,
my pipe did thée so much pleasure, and if thy slumber hath
presented thée any visions, note them, for al dreames that
men sée in <hi>Erecinus,</hi> prooue true: and with that standing
vp, me thought he had wings on his head, shoulders, and
féete: he bad me farwell, &amp; tooke his flight: then I knewe
it was <hi>Mercury.</hi> Whereupon, calling to mind the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of my iourney: I found that either I had lost loue, or
loue lost me: for my passions were eased, I left <hi>Erecinus</hi>
and hasted away as fast as I could, glad that one dreame
had rid me of fancy, which so long had fettred me,
yet could I not hie so fast, but ere I could
get home, I was ouertaken
with repentance.</p>
