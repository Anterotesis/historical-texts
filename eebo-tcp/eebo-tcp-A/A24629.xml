         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Richard Hubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn,</hi>
after the delivery of <hi>George
Fox</hi> his <hi>Letter</hi> to the King.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>SInce the Lord hath called and
gathered us to be a people to
walke in his feare, and in his truth, we
have alwaies suffered, and been persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the powers that have ruled; and
been made a prey of for departing from
iniquity. And when the breach of no
Law could be charged against us, then
they made Laws on purpose to ensnare
us, and so our sufferings were unjustly
continued.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, those that have ruled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you have been cruell, and have profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31282:3"/>
much which they have not done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>And likewise the same sufferings
doe now abound in more cruelty against
us in many parts of this Nation, as for
instance, one at <hi>Thetford</hi> in <hi>Norfolke,</hi>
where <hi>Henry Fell</hi> ministring unto the
people, was taken out from the meeting
and whipt, and sent out of that Towne
from Parish to Parish, towards <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
the chiefe ground of his accusation
in his passe which was shewn to the King
was because he denied to take the Oath
of Allegience and Supremacy; and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
for conscience sake we cannot
sweare, but have learned obedience to
the doctrine of Christ, who saith, <hi>Sweare
not at all;</hi> hereby an occasion is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, to persecute us; and as it is
well known we have not sworn for any
nor against any, but have kept to the
truth, and our <hi>yea</hi> hath been <hi>yea,</hi> and our
<hi>nay</hi> nay, in all things, which is more then
the Oath of those who are out of the
truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:31282:3"/>
               <speaker>R.</speaker>
               <p>But why can you not swear? for an
Oath is a common thing among men to any
engagement.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>It is manifest, and we have seen
it by experience, that it is so common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men to swear and engage either
for or against things, that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
taken of them, nor fear of an Oath:
that therefore which we speak from the
bottom of our hearts is more then they
swear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>But can you not promise as before the
Lord, which is the substance of the Oath?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, what we doe affirm we can
promise before the Lord, and take him
to our witnesse in it; but our so promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
hath not been accepted; but the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie
of an Oath they have stood for,
without which all other things were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of none effect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>But how may we know from the words
that you will perform?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>By proving of us, for they who
Swear are not known to be faithfull but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31282:4"/>
by proving of them, and so we by those
who have tryed us are found to be truer
in our promise then others by their oaths,
and to those that do yet prove us, we
shall yet do the same.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>Pray what is your principle?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>Our principle is that Jesus Christ
is the true light which enlightens every
one that cometh into the world, that all
men through him might believe, and that
they are to obey and follow this light as
they have received it, whereby they may
be lead unto God and unto righteousness
and the knowledge of the truth that they
may be saved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>This do all Christians confesse to be
truth, and he is not a Christian that will
deny it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>But many have denyed it both
in words and writings and opposed us in
it, and above a 100. Books are put forth
in opposition to this principle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lords,</speaker>
               <p>Then some of the Lords standing
by the K. said that none would deny that,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31282:4"/>
one of the Lords asked how long we had been
called Quakers, or did we own that Name?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>That name was given us in scorn
and dirision about twelve years since, but
there was some who lived in this truth
before we had that Name given us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>How long is it since you owned this
Judgement and way?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>It is near 12 years since I owned
this truth according to the manifestation
of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>What is your Name?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>Richard Hubberthorn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>Do you own the Sacraments?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>As for the word Sacrament I do
not read of it in the Scripture, but as for
the Body and blood of Christ I own, and
there is no remission without Blood.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>Well that is it, but do you not believe
that every own is commanded to receive it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>This we believe that according
as it is written in the Scripture, that
Christ at his last supper took bread and
brake it, and gave it to his Disciples, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31282:5"/>
also took the Cup and blessed it, and said
unto them, as often as ye do this, that is,
as often as you break bread you shew forth
the Lords death till he come, and this we
believe they did, and they eat their bread
in singleness of heart from house to house,
and Christ did come again unto them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his promise, after which they
said, we being many are one bread, for we
are all pertakers of this own Bread.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K. Friends.</speaker>
               <p>Then one of the K. Friends
said, that is truth, for as many Grains make
one bread of they being many Members are
one Body, Another of them said, if they be
bread they must be broken?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>There is difference between the
bread he brake at his last Supper, wherein
they were to shew forth his death as in a
sign till he came, and this whereof he spake
they being many are one bread, for herein
they were come more in the substance, and
to speak more mistically as they know in
the Spirit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K. Friends</speaker>
               <p>Then they said it was truth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31282:5"/>
and he had spoken nothing but the truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>How know you that you are inspired
by the Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>According as we read in the
Scriptures that the inspiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
gives understanding, for by its
inspiration is an understanding given us
of the things of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lords</hi> Then one of the Lords said how
do you know you are led by the true Spirit?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>This we know because the spirit
of truth it reproves the world of sin, and
by it we were reproved of sin, and also are
led from sin unto righteousnesse and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of truth, by which effects we know
it is the true spirit, for the spirit of the
wicked o doth not lead unto such things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K. and L.</speaker>
               <p>Then the King and Lords said
it was truth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>Well of this you may be assured that
you shall none of you suffer for your Opinions

            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>How do you own Magistrates or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>Thus we own Magistrates
whomsoever is set up by God, either K.
or Supream, or any set in Authority by
him, who are for the punishment of Evil
doers, and the praise of them that do well
such we shall submit unto &amp; assist in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
and civil things both by body
and estate, and if any man do that which
is unrighteous we must declare against it,
only submit under it by a patient suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and not rebell against any by Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
Plots, and Contrivances.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>Then the K. said it is enough.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lords,</speaker>
               <p>Then one of the Lords asked why
do you meet together seeing every one of you
have the Church in your selves?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>According as it is written in the
Scriptures the Church is in God, <hi>Thes. 1. 1.</hi>
and they who feared the Lord did meet
often together and speak one to another
and were edyfied and comforted one in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31282:6"/>
another, and so is our meeting together
in the fear of the Lord, and to us it is
profitable and herein we are edyfied and
strengthned in the Life of Truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>How did you first come to believe the
Scriptures were Truth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>I have believed the Scriptures
from a Child to be a declaration of truth,
when I had but a Litteral knowledge, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
education and tradition, but now I
know the Scriptures to be true by the
manifestation and operation of the spirit
of God fulfilling them in me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>In what manner doe you meet, and
what is the order in your meetings?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>We do meet in the same order
as the people of God did, waiting upon
him, and if any have an Exhortation
from the Lord he may speak it, or if any
have a word of reproof or admonition,
and as every one hath received the gift, so
they Minister one unto another, and
may be edyfied one by another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> One of the Lords said, then you know
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31282:7"/>
not so much as you may know but there is a
growth then to be admitted of?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, we do grow daily into the
knowledge of the truth in our exercise
and obedience to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>Are any of your friends gone to Rome?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>Yes there is one in prison at Rome.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p>Why did you send him thither?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. H.</speaker>
               <p>We did not send him thither
but he found something upon his Spirit
from the Lord whereby he was called to
go to declare against superstition &amp; Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
wich is contrary to the will of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K. F.</speaker>
               <p>The Kings Friends said there were
two at Rome but one of them was dead.</p>

               <p>Some of our Friends have been
in that Countrey.</p>
