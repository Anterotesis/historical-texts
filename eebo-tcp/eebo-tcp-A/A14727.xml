            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and doth as it were, of its owne accord offer it selfe to be discerned.</p>
               <p>The next and middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most is that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by him that lookes into things more fully, who layeth the object naked before his eyes, and uncovers it, as if a man should unbarke a Tree.</p>
               <p>The best and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent use which should be of highest esteeme, is that which is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest with labour, by him that doth consideratively weigh all businesses, and piercing through the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry marrow of the matter, brings all things to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination deliberately, yet frequently, when hee

diseases. Divines having the, Spirit of God for their guide, and Christ for their Teacher, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Gods providence in a lively manner by the example of Lilies, I say, Divines make use of them, to informe mens understandings, and to instruct them in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things; this very thing is more clearely seene in the holy Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of although there be but one sense, yet hath it a threefold use; the first is literall, which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the outside of the History, the second <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologicall,</hi> which serves for information of manners, the third, <hi>Anagogicall,</hi>

which doth elevate, the mind to spirituall and heavenly things, but above all, this is most clearely seene in the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> the lesse considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble use of it, is knowne to common people of the meanest capacity: It was first found out by one <hi>Nicander</hi> a Heardsman of <hi>Magnesia,</hi>

Yet I see no impediment, but that I may liken the one to the other in some respects: Especially, because the Lord himselfe doth not disdaine to denominate himselfe a Corner-stone, and those that are his, the living Stones of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Now that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to Heroicall spirits, and men that are famous for vertuous Acts, that they obtaine diverse titles for increase of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;

because of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Dignities, and for their excellent sayings and deeds, the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens unto the <hi>Load-stone,</hi> because of its many and notable vertues and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous effects, that so it might be honoured and adorn'd with divers names, of which there is none, that may not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Christ by a kind of excellency, and more aptly, then to the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> it selfe.

Christ is a <hi>Load stone</hi> to such as disagree, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-stone to such as be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder or at variance; So to his enemies or those that wrestle against him, He is an unconquerable Adamant (both which we read in the Encomiums, or prayses of <hi>Athanasius</hi>) I say he is an unconquered Adamant: No force and assaults of enemies, no not the raging fury of Satan, that roaring Lion and red Dragon, nor the gates of Hell can be able to prevaile against him.

               <p>AS all other heavie things, so Iron of its owne Nature goes downe-wards.

So that without violence or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, it never ascends

to the Aire, nor mounts to places above. Yet not withstanding, such is the marvelous Vertue of this wonder working Stone, that giving to the Iron but a light touch, and having once affected it, with its love, It present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsake its common Mother, hastens to the <hi>Load-stone</hi> with a Swift violent course, and with all possible endeavour, being ready to imbrace it, in the most loving manner that may be. But if it be detayn'd by force of hands or held backe by a string that it cannot touch it; then as it were most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently longing to come

               <p>AMong the least flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and precious Stones, there is none al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, which hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived some excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment from God, the bestower of all good things; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it hath received, with this limitation and condition, to reserve it, and to have it inherent in it selfe alone, but can very
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20110:38"/>
hardly communicate it, and transfuse it to other things of the same nature. If you put. Mallowes to Roses, they take none of the Rosie colour, or smell therefrom: If you put aflint or pumice stone to a Saphire or Emerald, they borrow no bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereby. The Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone only inricht by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with a special pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, triumphs in this, that it can endow the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, which is plac't by it, with its vertue and power to turne, and which you may more admire, it so endowes an Iron ring with this vertue, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next another, it shall impart the same vertue to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20110:38"/>
that, a second shall do it to a third, and so forward in a long rowe, and as yet, which goes almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all belief, it doth not onely these things by apposition or the lightest touch, but also by passing over to it, as it were by a certaine Divine inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, onely with this difference, that in a quick passage, the Iron is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest with Vertue, more weakly, and slightly, and is endewed with a lesse power to turne, but if it stay for some longer time, it receives a greater Vertue, even such as it may draw more strongly, abide in it the longer, and be more hardly lost?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20110:39"/>
therefore this one, this onely stone, among all other created things, is found worthy, not onely to shadow out, but also to represent to the life, the efficacy of the grace of Christ, and of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit: Though skill in Arts, and Sciences, and Languages, is not attained unto without hard labour, and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time, yet Christ did in abundant manner, give his holy Spirit, and his manifold gifts unto the Apostles, onely by breathing upon them which they also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed over to their Brethren, as Philip to Nathanael, Paul to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20110:39"/>
in a continued course to the end of the World; and surely with lesse labour, not onely by imposition of hands, but also by the shadow of a Body, passing by, and by the Handkerchiefes of the absent. Saul falling by the way into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Prophets, was toucht a little for a while, with a Propheticall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, But Elisha adhering diligently, and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the side of Elias, untill his ascent, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with a more plentifull abundance of the Spirit, even to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle? Those suddaine prayers also, which we call Ejaculations, never
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20110:40"/>
returne from heaven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, but draw downe from thence some small portion of grace at the least: But if one with Moses, and Elias, should for many daies together watch, and continue, all night in fastings, and prayer, he should be moistned, and refreshed with a more copious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of grace, as it were with a great shower.</p>

               <p>Our Saviour was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious indeed, by the conversion of so many, and by drawing such a multitude of people unto him: but at this time, by his drawing of the Wisemen, and their adoring of him, He is become more glorious then himselfe at other times: Oh my good Iesu, draw me also unto thy selfe; Convert me, and I
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20110:45"/>
shall be Converted, o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therwise no man comes unto thee, unles thou, and the Father draw him.</p>
               <p>The drawing of the Wisemen is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, then the rest, in regard of the Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or place where Christ was, and of his age, when he drew them unto him, and in respect of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, Dignity, and multitude of those that were drawne. First this drawing of the Wisemen is more excellent in regard of the Scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or place where Christ was, for indeed upon the Crosse he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20110:45"/>
drew but one, one that was neere him, one that hang'd by him, one almost fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his side, sixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him: But now in his very Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, He drew the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and in them whole Nations, dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame parts of the East; He drew them by one Starre, as it were with some trifle, to play withall, as if they had beene inticed to come, as Children are, by those things wherein they delight.</p>
               <p>After his ascention into heaven, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that from the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20110:46"/>
Throne of his glory, and the Right-hand of his Father, he drew so many, and draweth to this day: But now, that he should draw from the Stable; how full of astonishment is it?</p>
               <p>Secondly this drawing of the Wisemen, is more excellent in respect of his Age: At another time, when he was come to Maturity, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient age; He drew to him Fishermen: But now being but an Infant, and as it were, but of one day upon the Earth: He drew unto him Priests, Philosophers, and Kings: This was foretold long
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20110:46"/>
agoe;<note place="margin">Esay 8, 4.</note> that before the Child should know his Father, or Mother, the riches of <hi>Damascus,</hi> and the spoyle of <hi>Samaria,</hi> should be taken away before the King of <hi>Assyria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As when Hercules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Cradle kil'd (as they say) two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, he was paradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a more glorious Conqueror then he was, when being come to riper yeares, he vanquisht in the <hi>Nemaean</hi> Forrest, a Lyon of huge bignesse: Or when in <hi>Erimanthus</hi> a Mountaine of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> he tooke a live, a terrible Boare, that wasted that Border: So Christ was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20110:47"/>
more illustrious, when he drew to him Kings to adore him at his Cradle, where he was yet a little Child, Then when raining in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, He drew first such as Paul, and afterward such as Constantine was.</p>
               <p>Thirdly this draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wisemen is more excellent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his Maiesty; He drew other persons when he had shewed many Miracles, and was still adding to the number of them, as the Earthquake, the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Rocks, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse throughout the whole World &amp;c. Now
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20110:47"/>
He hath done a most wondrous work, being but an Infant, very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and not able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any hardinesse, crying as yet in his Cradle, and should not have been known, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Angells had made him manifest to the Sheepheards; the Starr to the Gentiles, and his crying to Strangers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here those Peeres, and great Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> which otherwise would not confesse themselves to be men, are constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to stand before him in a Stable, as it were in a Court: They are forc'd to appeare as upon a day appointed, by the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20110:48"/>
Summons of a Star as it were an Apparitor, that they should as it were pleade their cause, and become Suppliants in a black mourning habit: He drawes, he constraines them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no: O Loadstone, O thou that drawest, I confesse thou art at this day truly to be admired.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wisemen was more excellent in respect of their dignity that were drawne, at another time he drew but one Thiefe, or a murderer, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion and some few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Then after that, the common people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20110:48"/>
But now he drawes persons of the highest quality, <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> of the East, they were none of the lowest ranke, they were at least the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Kings, or Kings in their Embassadors, if so be we believe not that they were Kings in their owne persons.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the drawing of the Wisemen was more excellent in respect of the multitude that was drawne together with them; at other times he drew but a few, one, or two this day, to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morow a thousand. But now out of his very Cradle he drew three
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20110:49"/>
Kingdoms together of the <hi>Chaldaeans, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Sabaeans.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:20110:49"/>The common people with equall paces for the most part follow their Kings, Whether they be converted, averted, or perverted: what manner of Child think yee, shall this be? Assuredly, Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, there is more then <hi>Solomon</hi> here. They came indeed from <hi>Sheba</hi> to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and brought him gifts, but when he was something aged, and such a one as was well spoken of, for the Fame of his Wisedome. But it was a woman, that came, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Queene (and one of the <hi>Sibills</hi> in the opinion of some) yet a woman. But now when Christ was but a Little

Child; lying hid in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and compassed about with Straw, in the midst of two beasts, very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men Kings and Chiefe Rulers of sacred things, and Philosophers came with hast, from the furthest parts of the East; as it is probable, that they might know him.</p>
               <p>This Child is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater then <hi>Solomo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THere is a great and manifest difference betweene the first moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Iron to the Magnetick Poles, and all the latter that arise from the first. For at the first touching and drawing, the Iron is rather a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent than an Agent; the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20110:62"/>
Iron indeed is drawne, being untoucht, but approacheth softly and slowly, unwillingly, as it were by violence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the contract, either no friendship at all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth betweene the Iron and the Loadstone, no respective verticity, or pronenesse to turne to the Poles, or it is so weake, and as it were so soundly asleepe, that it can scarce be perceived by the senses; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once stirred up and awakened by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones, coupling with it, and breathing upon it, runs of its owne accord, and very speedily, at the command, and as it were
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20110:62"/>
at the least call of the Loadstone. A greater and more manifest diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is, betweene those Arts and motions which go before, and accompany our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and those which follow it, as the fruits and effects thereof; for in those precedent Arts, our will behaves it selfe in an hostile and passive manner: all familiarity with God is not only laid asleepe in us, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so quite dead; neither were we only estranged from him, but also alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether averse, and his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, hatefull, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God; but in these slips and sins which are
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20110:63"/>
committed after our conversion, some like things happens to us, as doth to the dust of Iron, long burnt in the fire, or defiled with filth, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with rust; for the clammy inward moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the Iron is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by these, and the strength of it diminished, which as in a sicke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is with more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty raised up by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone; such Iron is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawne by it, neither can it be done in such a distance, nor with such a speedy pace: Now the very same thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to Apostata's, those that sin unto death, and against the holy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20110:63"/>
Ghost, as to the same I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron dust strongly and vehemently burnt in a close Furnace of rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, where the flame is beaten backe, and so is turn'd into <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Martis,</hi> as some call it, or calcin'd in red powder, whose inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to turne, is renewed by no power of the Loadstone, nor can be revoked by any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, as being wholly and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; So it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and have
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20110:64"/>
tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them againe to repentance.</p>

For if there be but the least gap or space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, it is endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much lesse ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and drawes the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den more unsuccessive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, weakly, and slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishly; neither will it lift up half that weight, which it would most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily lift up, if it were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exactly, without the least cleft betweene it, and that which is tied to it.

some are Gyants, some Dwarffs: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there are some stones, great in quantity, but weake in strength; such as scarcely, &amp; verie hardly lift up a weight that is but equall to themselves: Some again are small and little, not exceeding the quantitie of a Filberd, that lift up their weight threescore times, nay, an hundred times multiplyed. God useth to be of greater power in small, than in great things. It is said there is greater life in Emmets than in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, in Dwarffs than in Gyants. If there were some great Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,

that could lift up its owne weight fiftie times multiplyed; there were some danger lest it should be adored as an Idoll: Among poore people that have but slender possessions, and small abilities, you may see many that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their vertue to an object more remote and and distant; There are likewise just as many signes, whereby noble and heroical Christians are discerned from those that are luke-warme and vulgar. They are more quick spirited and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to performe good works, they goe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout holy duties, groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and lamenting, with an ill will, like those kine that drew the Ark, which lowed on the way as they went. Secondly, they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the crosse more couragiously, and beare those temptations that are more grievous than
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:20110:98"/>
ordinary, like <hi>Samson,</hi> who without much ado took up the brazen gates on his shoulders. Lastly, they do endevor to win and draw, not one, or two, or a few; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny soules unto Christ: for so it is mentioned of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that hee was a good man, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were converted unto God by his meanes.</p>

               <head>Chap. 38. Of the small estimation and scarcenesse of Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones &amp; Christians, and of their native places.</head>
               <p>THere are now abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Loadstones in severall places so that their too much familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or frequencie, hath brought them into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt among the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, with whom nothing is counted pretious, but that which is scarce. There is no Region al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, no Iron-mine,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:20110:120"/>
wherin Loadstones may not be found; that is to say, common Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones of no note, of no vertue; there are few very excellent, notable, and strong. In like sort there are abundance of men in every place; but few noble, learned, and wise: Of Christians, in name and title, there is no small store, and they are very cheap: But of such as are truly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as worthy of so great a title; there is a great deale of scarsitie and dearth in all places. If any enquire of the place &amp; Region, where the best kind of Load-stones
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20110:121"/>
are bred? In times past <hi>Magnesia</hi> did yeeld the most famous, from whence it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their name is derived: But now in that place, there are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none at all, or such as are very barren in vertue; the ordinarie sort are brought from <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it pleaseth the God of nature, he doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blesse one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, sometimes another with this condition. In like manner at Antioch, in those ancient times, the first Christians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained both their name and Seat; but in Beraea were the most Noble: England is reputed of late, a most plentifull Island, and most happy Mother of holy and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing God hath his freedome, to honour at his pleasure any other Church with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Praerogative.</p>
