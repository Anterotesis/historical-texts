            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>DIvine Providence having
suffered these Kingdoms
to destroy one another for
many Ages, in divided Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies;
reserv'd their happy Union
for the Merciful Royal Family, of
which <hi>Your Majesty</hi> is now the
<hi>Head:</hi> and mingl'd lawfully in
their Veins,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> The last four pages of the Book.</note> all those many and
different Bloods-Royal, which
pretended to any Soveraignty in
these your Dominions: designing
thereby at once to reward the
Vertue of Your <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
and to endear that Union
to us, in preventing future De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.
In King <hi>Iames,</hi> Your Royal
Grand-Father, these Nations got
<pb facs="tcp:59981:3"/>
a Monarch, who was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to be the <hi>Solomon</hi> of His
Age: who excell'd all His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
Princes in<note n="*" place="margin">His own word.</note> King-Craft;
all his Ministers in Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and all His Doctors in
Learning. None of his Subjects
understood the Law better, or
observ'd it more: and who
knew as well all that was done
at Council-Tables abroad, as
they who sat at them. To Him
succeeded <hi>Your Majesty's Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
whose Life was the best
Law a King could make: who
knew no use of Power, save to
do good by it: who was less
careful of His own Blood, than
of that of his Subjects: And I
may justly say, that Heaven only
was govern'd by a better King.
After we had shown our selves
unworthy of such Monarchs, the
Divine Goodness, to try us once
<pb facs="tcp:59981:3"/>
more, gave us <hi>Your Gracious Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
whose Clemency (after so
many and so great Injuries) was
as great a Miracle as His Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
who knew every thing
save to be severe; and could
bear every thing, save to see His
People in trouble: who after
the abuse of His Goodness, had
made his Enemies so insolent,
that His Servants concluded all
was lost; did, by His extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
parts, with a gentle easiness,
peculiar to Himself, dissipate those
execrable Combinations, to our
great satisfaction and amazement.
But, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Conscience of His
Enemies, will far exceed in His
Praises, the Eloquence of His
Servants; and so my trembling
Hand leaves this Melancholy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59981:4"/>
His Throne is now fill'd with
<hi>Your Sacred Majesty,</hi> whose Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
Your Royal Brother esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so much, that He shar'd with
You the Exercise of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
before His Death gave
you the Possession of the Crown.
In You, <hi>Sir,</hi> Your People have
a <hi>General</hi> to their <hi>Armies,</hi> an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral</hi>
to their <hi>Fleet,</hi> a <hi>Treasurer</hi>
to their <hi>Mony:</hi> whose Courage
can lead them as far as theirs can
follow; and raise the Glory of
these Kingdoms as high as they
can wish: So that if they be not
happy, they will have this Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their Misfortunes, that
the World will see, that they
themselves are only to be blam'd
for it.</p>
            <p>Our Country, <hi>Sir,</hi> does not
boast of a rich Soil, or a hot Sun:
but it may, that it has given these
<pb facs="tcp:59981:4"/>
happy Islands those Gracious and
Glorious Kings. In return where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
we might have expected
kinder Rewards, than that any
of their Natives should debate
its Antiquity, and the Veracity
of those Histories wherein the
great Actions of Your Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
were recorded. And
since the Honour of the Ancient
and Royal Race of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
is the chief thing wherein
we Glory; it is hard to deny us a
Favour, so just on our part, and
so easy on theirs. However, <hi>Sir,</hi>
since I presume, that those of
Your other Subjects, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert
this, do so, rather from
want of information, than from
unkindness; I, who am resolv'd
to make the defence of Your
meanest Priviledges my greatest
Honour, have thought it incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
to me, as <hi>Your Advocate,</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:59981:5"/>
undertake the defence of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
which makes <hi>Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi>
the most Ancient Monarch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth. Which Argument, I
hope, I have manag'd with that
Candour, which becomes an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Man, and that Zeal which
is the Duty of,</p>

            <head>A LETTER to the
EARL of PERTH,
Lord High Chancellor of
SCOTLAND,
Upon his having sent to the Author
the Bishop of St. Asaph's Book.
With some Reflections upon the
Design of that Book.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have read the <hi>Book</hi> you sent me,
with that delight I did of old a
<hi>Play;</hi> which one may think it
resembles more, than our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
do a Romance: For what is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related, is so disguised and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
as may best suit with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Design; and with a Rhetorick
so Polite and Comical, that if the
Reasons do not convince, yet the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59981:6"/>
and Stile may charm, and please,
even some of those against whom it
is design'd. This made me unwilling
at first to undertake to answer a
Book, which I suppose might have
more Admirers than Proselytes: but
finding, upon a second perusal,
that the Author had not fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the Grounds upon which our
Historians proceeded, or had suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself to be byass'd by Zeal for
his Order, or Partiality to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
And that this whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
take it as an Injury done, not
only to the Antiquity of the <hi>Royal
Family,</hi> but to this our Nation in
general; I was at last prevailed with
to enter the Lists, with a kind De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
by a sober and candid Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
rather to convince and
satisfy the Author, and those he
may have misled, than to acquire
the vain glory of such a Victory,
especially over one who bears the
Character of a Bishop, for which I
have so great a Veneration: Altho,
for the Reasons following, I cannot
but dislike his unnecessary Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
and unseasonable and partial
Management of a National Debate,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59981:6"/>
which<note n="*" place="margin">Ja. 6. Par. 20. c. 9.</note> we are prohibited to enter
upon under pain of a Sedition.</p>
            <p>1. I am sorry, that while these
Kingdoms are unhappily divided, not
in Nations, but Opinions; the old
Animosities amongst Scots, English,
and Irish, being forgot and buried,
and the modern Differences between
the <hi>Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Fanatick,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi>
and <hi>Republican,</hi> or, as some
term it, <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> are so violent
and turbulent; the Author should
have diverted our just and dutiful
Zeal, by imploying it in defence of
an important right of <hi>State,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly,
as well as unnecessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded:
so as the other, of near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to the Church, may in some
measure come to be neglected.</p>
            <p>2. The pretext for writing this
Book, wherein the Antiquity of our
Kings and Nation is so much dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd,
being, that the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
and particularly <hi>Blondel,</hi> urg'd from
our Historians, that we had a Church
for some Years without Bishops: it
seem'd neither just nor fit, that any
Episcopal Author should have mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd
so highly the meanest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that ever was us'd by a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian;</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59981:7"/>
as for it, to cut off 44 <hi>Kings</hi>
(all preceding <hi>Coranus,</hi> who began
his Reign <hi>anno</hi> 501) and to expose
on a <hi>Pillory</hi> as <hi>Forgers,</hi> our many
and grave <hi>Historians.</hi> And that it
is a weak Argument, appears from
this, that I have met with very few
<hi>Laicks</hi> in all our Country, who had
heard of it; nor with one, even of
these few, who had valu'd it: and
so this Author may be said, rather
to have suggested a new Argument,
than to have answered an old One:
For they urge now nothing to us,
save places of Scripture; resolving
to have their <hi>Presbytery, Iuris Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vini:</hi>
knowing that nothing less can
secure them, in opposing the Laws
of the Kingdom. And what can
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> think of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arguments, which they value
much. Since this, which they valu'd
so little, is thought of such force, by
a learned Bishop, as to deserve a
whole Book, the cutting off of 44
<hi>Kings,</hi> and the offending a <hi>Nation
of Friends.</hi> It is also very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that the learn'd Doctor
<hi>Hammond,</hi> a great Champion of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi>
owns the Antiquity of our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59981:7"/>
               <hi>Nation;</hi> and answers fully that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
without overturning the
truth of our History, or wronging the
Antiquity of <hi>our Royal-Line:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Baxter</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> urges this
Citation, and yet agrees with this
Author in opposing the Antiquity of
our History; approving what is said
by <hi>Cambden</hi> and <hi>Vsher;</hi> and in a
Letter to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi>
asserting the lateness of our settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
here. Which shews, that
there is no necessity lying upon
such as own <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> to wrong
the Antiquity of our <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
But how the necessity of a
private corner of a remote Country
in <hi>Ecclesi√¢ constituend√¢,</hi> could wrong
the general practice of the <hi>Church;</hi> is
as little to be understood, as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable,
that many thousands in
<hi>Iapan,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> were converted
by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> before <hi>Bishops</hi> were
sent thither. And since it cannot be
deny'd, but that those who ordain'd
our <hi>Presbyters</hi> were <hi>Bishops;</hi> it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follows, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was
settl'd in the <hi>Christian Church</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we had <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Culdees:</hi>
or else, if these who ordain'd our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59981:8"/>
               <hi>Presbyters</hi> were not <hi>Bishops,</hi> the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of that <hi>Church,</hi> whereby our
<hi>Presbyters</hi> were ordain'd, should
have been impugn'd, and not the
<hi>Authority</hi> of our <hi>Histories,</hi> and the
<hi>Antiquity</hi> of <hi>our Royal-Line</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd.
And though this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
and Learn'd <hi>Author</hi> could
prove, that we were not setled here,
before the Year 503, yet that could
not answer the Argument: for the
<hi>Culdees</hi> might have been settled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time in this Country, where
we now live, though amongst the
<hi>Picts;</hi> for it cannot be deny'd but
the <hi>Picts</hi> were setled in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
before that time. And when
our Historians say that the <hi>Abbots</hi>
of <hi>Icolm-kill</hi> had Jurisdiction over
all the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Province;</hi> that
is to be understood, as <hi>Beda</hi> observes,
<hi>more inusitato;</hi> and my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
himself well remarks these words,
and gives a full and clear vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the passages of <hi>Beda</hi> in the
173, and following <hi>Pages;</hi> and might
have rested therein, and needed not
to have been driven to seek a new
Answer in overturning the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Nation. Many examples
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59981:8"/>
can be given of Jurisdiction of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi>
and even of <hi>Deacons</hi> over
<hi>Bishops</hi> in the <hi>Canon Law</hi> and <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
So that this instance from our
Historians makes nothing against
<hi>Episcopacy.</hi> And latter <hi>Historians</hi>
meeting with these ambiguous
words in our <hi>Annals, De signatus,
Electus, Ordinatus,</hi> were by a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
induc'd to appropriate these
words to the formal Ceremony of
<hi>Ordination and Imposition of Hands.</hi>
And I find, by the Bishop's Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 169, 170. 171.</note>
that the <hi>Abbess Hilda</hi> did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and send forth such of her
Monks, as she thought fit to be
ordain'd: which is all that our
<hi>Guldees,</hi> and ancient Monks did.
Thus a King may be said to make
one a Bishop, or a Mother to have
made one of her Sons a Church-man;
which answer, the learned <hi>Nicol,</hi> a
zealous friend to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> thought
sufficient to elide <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from our Historians, without
denying the Antiquity of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or troubling himself with our
<note n="*" place="margin">See his late Book, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Les preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus reformees convanious du Schism,</hi> p. 547. 548, 549, 550.</note>
               <hi>Culdees.</hi> And if <hi>Beda</hi> had heard
that the Presbyters did ordain Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
he had remark'd it as a most
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59981:9"/>
unusal thing, having marked that
the Abbots had jurisdiction over Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
they being but Presbyters;
such an Ordination being much more
extraordinary, than such a Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And might not my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
as well have inveigh'd against <hi>Gildas</hi>
and the British Historians, because
he says<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 89.</note> that Church-men were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
by the consent of the Bishops
and the rest of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> from
which <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same, <hi>Blondel</hi>
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Pag. 72, 73.</note> infers a parity
betwixt Bishops and Presbyters.
And from which it appears, that
dangerous Consequences should not
be drawn from the dubious and
heedless expressions of old Authors,
living in rude Times and Places: and
from all which we might have been
secure, that my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi> would
have concur'd with the wise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
which <hi>Spotswood,</hi> Arch-Bishop
of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> (with whom the
learn'd <hi>Hammond</hi> agrees) gave to
that silly Argument, without affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him as a betrayer of the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Cause; and caressing our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks</hi>
by that unwarrantable and
dangerous assertion; <hi>that in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59981:9"/>
thereof they might reasonably
conclude, that when they covenanted
against</hi> Episcopacy, <hi>they had only
us'd their own right; and thrown out
that, which was a confess'd innovation;
in order to the restoring of that, which
was their primitive Government.</hi> For
it does not follow, that because our
Church in its infancy and necessity
was without Bishops for some Years;
that therefore it was reasonable for
Subjects, to enter into a <hi>Solemn
League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> without, and
against the consent of their <hi>Monarch;</hi>
and to extirpate Episcopacy settled
then by Law, and by an old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of 1200 Years at least.</p>
            <p>3. Precedency being one of the
Jewels of the Crown and one of
the chief Glories of Princes; and
all who treat on that Subject confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
that the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi>
as King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Monarch in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Line
of other Kingdoms having been
often interrupted, whereas ours ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was; it seems a great injury to
our Kings, to have their Line
shortened, so as thereby to postpone
them, to many others; and if this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59981:10"/>
Author's Arguments prove any thing,
they must prove that our Kings
cannot instruct their Antiquity, till
<hi>Malcolm</hi> the <hi>3d's</hi> Time: and so our
Kings will be amongst the last of
all <hi>Crowned-Heads.</hi> Nor is it one
of the least Arguments, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with us, to hazard all for our
<hi>Royal-Line,</hi> that we have been so
long Subjects to it, and happy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it: and therefore whoever shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
it, lessens (though without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign)
the influence of our Kings,
and endangers the Succession. And
since<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Luddus</hi> owns, that he durst
not deny the British Descent from
<hi>Brutus,</hi> lest he might thereby wrong
the <hi>Majesty</hi> of the English Nation;
I admire, that any of the Subjects
of <hi>Great Britain</hi> did not think it a
degree of <hi>Lese-Majesty,</hi> to injure and
shorten the <hi>Royal-Line</hi> of their
Kings.</p>
            <p>4. If this injury had been done to
Kings, or to a Nation, when they
were Enemies to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> as the
Obligation was, so the fault had been
less. But to inveigh against our
<hi>Royal-Line,</hi> after King <hi>Iames</hi> had
made the settlement of <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59981:10"/>
his business; King <hi>Charles</hi> had died
for it; and our late Soveraign of
Glorious Memory, had been more
disquieted by the Schismatical oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
made to it, than by all his other
concerns, seems very unkind. And
tho this learned and worthy <hi>Author,</hi>
upon design to make us sit down
quietly under these Injuries, seems to
gratifie us, by the Complement,
<q>That we, since the Writing of our
Histories, needed not such helps,
as old and fabulous Romances:
telling us, that we have excell'd
most other Nations, in Arts, and
Arms; and especially in the Purity
of Religion, abating only the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
which we have contracted
by too easie a belief of these Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which he designs to Refute.</q>
Yet, since no Peer in <hi>England,</hi>
though a Subject, would have allow'd
this Author to tell him, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
he be now a brave and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Person; his Predecessors
were lately pilfering barbarous
Robbers and Vagabonds, and the
History of his Family a fabulous Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
How should he have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
that our Kings and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59981:11"/>
(how gentle soever) would have
thought, that the Justice done them
in this Age (and for which we
thank the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>)
should have compens'd the Injuries
done to their Predecessors?</p>
            <p>But it is probable, that my Lord
St. <hi>Asaph</hi> has not, on the one hand,
known the Grounds which we
here urge for our Antiquity, and
that our nice Jealousie for our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
on the other hand, magnifies
too much to us such injuries, of
which we are naturally very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:
and therefore, I hope, by
his Lordship's aquiescence, the result
of the Debate will be, that he
will see that our <hi>Royal-Line</hi> and
<hi>Nation</hi> are more ancient than he
imagined them to have been: and
that we will remain convinc'd,
that his Book was not dictated by
malice, and National Humour.</p>
            <p>My Design is not to convince my
Readers, that I am Learn'd, but
that my Cause is just: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I use no more Citations, even

assertions and positions in that

the remotest Consequence, be urg'd
against that <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> which I so
much reverence; I, as his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties

that in both these Points the <hi>Bishop</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59981:13"/>
has (though I hope without design)
injur'd our <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi> For
proving whereof,</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> thing I shall clear, shall be,
That History requires, nor admits no
Mathematieal, nor Legal Proof, but
is satisfied with such Moral Certainty,
as is infer'd from probable Tradition,
old Manuscripts, credible Historians,
the Testimony of Foreign Authors, and
probable Reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> That our Histories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already acquiesced in, and received
by the generality of Mankind, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by <hi>Criticks, Antiquaries,</hi> and
<hi>Historians,</hi> the best Iudges in such
cases, need no Confirmation, nor fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> That albeit we are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to prove, or confirm our History,
yet we are able to do it by all the
former Grounds, which is all that
needs be done for the Credit of any
History.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly;</hi> I shall answer the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
brought by the Bishop against
our Histories. And I must intreat my
Readers to lay all these together, and
not to judg by parcels, which is not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59981:14"/>
to be done, especially in cases of this
nature.</p>
            <p>For clearing the first of these
Points,<note place="margin">SECT. 1. What Proofs are necessary in History.</note> it is fit to consider, that right
Reason requires only in all cases,
such Proofs, as the nature of the
Subject can allow: and therefore,
though <hi>Mathematicians</hi> rest only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
infallible Demonstrations; and
the <hi>Law</hi> requires strict and solemn
Proofs; Yet the <hi>Law</hi> it self remits
its ordinary Exactness, to comply
with the necessity of Human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
allowing Domestick Witnesses,
where others cannot be had, and
strong presumptive Grounds as equal
to Witnesses, where the Subject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
can admit of no other Proofs:
<hi>Morality</hi> convinces by probable
Reasons, and <hi>History</hi> allows Moral
Certainty for a sufficient Probation
in matters of Fact, because the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
treated of in it, can general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admit no exacter Proofs: Which
Proposition as to History, will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easily appear, if we consider, that
even the Historians of this present
Age, cannot themselves see every
thing they relate; nor can all be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59981:14"/>
prov'd by the Testimony of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
Reason likewise has oblig'd
Men to presume, that a Nation ought
as much to be believ'd in these cases,
as two Witnesses are in any single
one: for even in the case of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
our belief is founded upon
the presumption, that they will not
lie, and damn themselves; and that
both the one, and the other, do at
last resolve in presumptive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Grounds: So that Men satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
themselves in most things, with
the general Belief and Tradition of
those among whom they live, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon probable Reasons. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts
also written by others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
no Mathematical nor Legal Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty:
For the Author of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript
might have been mistaken,
or byass'd; and at best, one Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
proves not. Nor are Strangers
oblig'd to believe the exactest <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>
of those who write in favour
of the Antiquity of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon any other account, than
because <hi>History</hi> is satisfy'd with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Grounds. Domestick Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
infer only a probable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
and tho an Oath were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59981:15"/>
that could creat no more than
a moral Certainty.</p>
            <p>As the former Proposition is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon just Reason, so all <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
have been believ'd, and the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories</hi>
of all Nations have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
upon probable Grounds and
Warrants, though they were not
written by those who saw and heard
what they wrote. Amongst many

had no Historical Warrant for the
first 2000 years, but Tradition, and
after that time, their Transactions
were mention'd in very few Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<hi>Histories:</hi> And the Annals of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59981:15"/>
their own <hi>Priests</hi> were thought good
Historical Foundations, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Appion.</note>
               <hi>Iosephus,</hi> even for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
History. I need not mention
the Histories of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who
could have no Records for many
hundreds of years before they wrote;
and much less those of the <hi>French,</hi>
and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whose Histories might
much more justly be questioned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Grounds that ours are.</p>
            <p>The surest Foundation then of all
Histories, is the common belief and
consent of the Natives: For Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
cannot know but from them,
and this consent and belief may be
founded upon credible Tradition,
Manuscripts, Domestick Witnesses,
but especially when these are forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
by the concurring Testimonies
of Foreign Authors, probable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the acquiescence of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
And tho less accepted for
fortifying an Ancient, than Modern
History, and that even a part of
these would be sufficient to confirm
a Modern one; yet I hope to make
them all concur for supporting ours,
tho very ancient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59981:16"/>
It would appear then by this, that
as the <hi>Bishop</hi> of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to defame our History with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any necessity, so he does it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any shadow of Reason: and
we will at least have the satisfaction
to see our Histories subsist as long as
any Histories can do.</p>
            <p>I conceive also, that in Reason,
Historians already receiv'd in the
World with Applause, need not
show their Warrants whereupon
they proceed; No more than a
Man that is in possession needs prove
or confirm his Right, except the
same be prov'd to be false, or a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
or stronger Right be produced
by him who challenges the former.
Nor are Men curious to preserve old
Manuscripts and Records, after they
have form'd their Histories by them:
for else no Historian could ever be
secure, if the not being able to
show their Warrants, after many
Ages, might discredit their History.
And I desire to know, where are
these few Historians, whom <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,
Livius,</hi> and others do cite in
their Histories? Or, these whom
<hi>Iosephus</hi> did cite to confirm that of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59981:16"/>
the Jews, when it was challeng'd
by <hi>Appion</hi> the <hi>Grammarian,</hi> upon the
same grounds that ours is now quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd
by the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph?</hi>
And albeit the authority of a single

his History is written, and that
then his Warrants might be call'd
for; especially if other Manuscripts
could be found, written in the time
controverted, by which that Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

the History controverted did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
things inconsistent with the

the Principles of common Sense and

this cannot at all be extended to

written by Men of great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all agreeing very well with
one another, and relating things
probable in themselves, and very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to Foreign Histories, and
which they declare, they did draw

which have for many Years, been

those few, and ill-founded Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,

to clear, that our Historians
have proceeded upon sufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
according to the former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertible
Propositions, which
I at first laid down in relation to
History in general. And this I
will endeavour to do, 1. By shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59981:18"/>
that our Tradition is very well
founded. 2. By shewing, that we
had ancient Annals, and that our
Historians were Men of great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and that they founded their
Histories on those ancient Annals.
3. That the best Historians among
the <hi>Britains,</hi> do concur to assert our
Antiquity; and that such as oppose
it, are Men of so little authority, as
that their Testimony should not be
put in the Ballance with those who
stand for us. 4. That our Histories
are confirm'd by the authority of
ancient Foreign Authors. 5. That
our Histories have been believ'd and
applauded by the best of late <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Critiques,</hi> and <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> the
best Judges in such cases. 6. That
the antiquity of our History is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon solid Reason, and great
Probability as well as upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Authors, both within
and without the Isle: Which is all
that can be done, or is requisite for
asserting and proving the Truth of
any History.</p>
            <p>For clearing whereof I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
my Reader, that whilst this

               </note>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> tells us, That
the <hi>Gauls deriv'd their first Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from them.</hi> And all Histories ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
That these us'd to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Histories of their own times
in Verses, which were taught by
them to their Scholars: and it is
probable, that some of these <hi>Druids</hi>
having been converted from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Religion,</hi> whereof they were the
Priests, became our first <hi>Monks;</hi>
being thereto much inclin'd by the
severity of their former Discipline:
as the <hi>Therapeutae</hi> did for the same
Reason become the first <hi>Anchorits</hi>
in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and so it was easie for
them to inform the Monasteries of
what they knew so well. And this
Hint is confirm'd by a very clear
passage in <hi>Leslies</hi> Preface to his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
who being a Bishop himself,
should be believ'd by another of the
same Character in a probable matter
of Fact. Nor can there be a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Confirmation of our having had
the <hi>Druids</hi> amongst us, than that in
several places of the <hi>Irish</hi> Version of
the <hi>New Testament,</hi> the <hi>wise Men,</hi> or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59981:19"/>
               <hi>Priests,</hi> are translated <hi>Druids:</hi> and
so, where the <hi>English</hi> Translation
saith, That <hi>the Wise Men from the
East came to worship our Saviour:</hi> Our
<hi>Irish</hi> Translation has the <hi>Druids,</hi> &amp;c.
Our Predecessors also being descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the <hi>Spanish Gallicks,</hi> or
<hi>Galicians,</hi> as is acknowledg'd by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians;
and they having had the
use of Letters, and of Grammar,
long before this time, as<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 96. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Casaubon.</note> 
               <hi>Strabo</hi>
confesses, it cannot be imagined,
but that we as a Colony of them,
would have likewise a part of their
Art and Learning. Our Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
also had their <hi>Sanachies</hi> and
<hi>Bards;</hi> The first whereof were the
Historians, and the latter the Poets
of their Traditions, as <hi>Luddus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
acknowledges, and by either of
these means, the Memory of our
<hi>Kings</hi> and their Actions, might have
been preserv'd until the 5th Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
at which time we got Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries;
in which (as I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
prove) were written and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the <hi>Annals</hi> of our Nation.
And since nothing but great Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities,
and fundamental Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stencies,
should be allow'd to refute
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59981:19"/>
a History already receiv'd. I shall
offer these Considerations for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that this way of preserving
the Memory of our Kings, is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
a mean as any can be in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
            <p>1. It is probable that our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as all the rest of Mankind, who
are warlike, and in constant action,
would be desirous to preserve the
memory of those Actions, for which
they had hazarded their Lives, and
by which they design'd to preserve
that Fame, which they preferr'd to
Life it self: And that the Kings
likewise, whose Authority and
Right was much reverenc'd for its
Antiquity, would be as careful to
preserve those Marks of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Dominion.</p>
            <p>2. We do not in this serious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
pretend to such ancient Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
and Descents, as might
through Vanity tempt Men to lie,
as those do, who endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
themselves from the <hi>Trojans.</hi>
All that we pretend to in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
being only, that we are a
Colony, who probably came first
from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> but settled
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59981:20"/>
certainly in <hi>Ireland</hi> for some time:
and that we came from them, after
the time, in which <hi>Cambden,</hi> and
<hi>Vsher</hi> acknowledge that the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Scots</hi> (whose Name we
only now bear) were long settled
there. Would not our Accusers
have us trust the <hi>British</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for 2500 years? and the <hi>Irish</hi>
for a longer time than our own,
without any written History, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript
now extant before <hi>Gilda</hi>'s
time? And tho <hi>Lycurgus</hi> would not
suffer his Laws to be written, yet
they were preserv'd in the Memories
of Men, for more than 600 Years,
as <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes; and we and
other Nations have preserv'd some
Laws for much longer time, without
the help of writing. And the only
Points here controverted, being the
first Settlement of our Nation, and
that we continue Subjects to the same
race of Kings; these are matters so
remarkable, that most Nations know
when such Changes happened to one
another. As for instance, tho there
were no History yet extant, we
should easily have known that the
<hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59981:20"/>
the <hi>Britons,</hi> and alter'd the
Race of their Kings. That <hi>Ireland</hi>
had many little Monarchs, till they
were swallow'd up by <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d
of <hi>England.</hi> And that <hi>Edward Bruce,</hi>
Brother to our glorious King <hi>Robert</hi>
the first, was chosen King of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
with universal Consent there, and
might have continued in that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
if from too great a love
to Fame, and to gain a Victory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Brother, he had not lost it,
and himself. And though all these
controverted Points, fell out in a
time after the use of Letters was
known to most Nations, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to the <hi>Druids</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi>
the one whereof were our Priests,
and the other our Neighbours very
long, yet there remains not the least
vestige of a doubt, that our Scepter
was ever sway'd by any other Race.</p>
            <p>3. Though we had wanted the
use of Letters, as most probably we
did not; Yet the Tradition contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
is at most of about 800 years.
For, after that time, it shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that we had Records and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals:
And the things said of our
Kings, during that time, are so few,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59981:21"/>
and so remarkable, that Men might
have taught the same to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in a weeks time: And Men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so long at that time, that ten or
twelve Men might have transmitted
the Tradition to one another. As
also, since private Families do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to this day their Tradition for
as long time as this; it was much
more easy for a Nation, and their
Kings, to preserve theirs. Nor can I
tell why my Lord <hi>St. Asaph,</hi> in his
Preface, can controvert our Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though we could not produce
Writers who lived in those Times,
wherein these Actions are said to be
done: since<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 71.</note> he thinks <hi>it reasonable
to judge that there was the same Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
here in</hi> Britain, <hi>though for
want of Ancient Writings, there could
be produced no plain Instances of it.</hi>
And if this be allowed to <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
in these times, why should he not
have allow'd the same favour to his
Monarch's Predecessors, in the same
and more ancient Ages.</p>
            <p>4. It was much easier for us to
preserve our Traditions, than for the
<hi>English,</hi> we being all descended from
the same Race, and being still the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59981:21"/>
same People, living under the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
succession of the same
<hi>Royal-Line;</hi> Whereas they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to suppress the Traditions and
Memorials of the People whom they
had conquer'd.</p>
            <p>5. As no Man is presum'd to lie,
or cheat, without some great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
so the most glorious things
that are said of us, are true beyond
debate. As our having defended
the Ground in which we setled, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all opposition to this very
day: Our having put the first stop
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness; our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beat the far more numerous
<hi>Britans,</hi> though defended by strong
Walls, and stronger <hi>Romans:</hi> All
which cannot be deny'd to have
been done by us, and are equally
noble, whether we were setled here
or not, when we did them. After
those controverted Times, it cannot
be deny'd, that we carried our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
further into <hi>Britain</hi> than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly:
That we fought long with
success against the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi>
and did at last extirpate the latter:
And when we were alone, we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
and extended our former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59981:22"/>
against the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
which proves also, that in
the Wars which we had against the
<hi>Romans</hi> in conjunction with the
<hi>Picts,</hi> the Victories we then got,
are chiefly to be ascrib'd to us.
And to crown all, we have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
contributed all that was in
our power, to support that Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and Royal Family (so unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd
for its antiquity) by which
we were animated, and instructed to
do all those great Actions, till they
are now become the Monarchs of
the whole Isle; having by a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
way extinguished those Wars
and Animosities, and may he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
who revives them.</p>
            <p>For clearing how this Tradition
might have been, and was preserv'd;
Our History tells us of a probable
way among many others, which
was, That at the Coronation of our
Kings, one appeared and recited
his whole Genealogy. I shall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my Reader only with a proof of
this Custom, which is such as confirms
also the Genealogy of King <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
the <hi>3d,</hi> in the year 1249, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to <hi>Fordon</hi>'s time, or to the view
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59981:22"/>
of any such Debate, and is related
by <hi>Fordon</hi> and <hi>Major</hi> in the Life
of that King; and being so memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Fact, and so near <hi>Fordon</hi>'s
own time, his Relation cannot but
be credited. His words are, That
<hi>the King being plac'd in the Marble-Chair,
the Crown upon his Head, and
the Scepter in his Hand, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
being set below Him, a Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
old High-landed Gentleman stept
out, and bowing the Knee, express'd
himself to the King in the High-land
Language thus; God bless you King</hi>
Alexander, <hi>Son of</hi> Alexander, <hi>Son
of</hi> William, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so carried
up the Genealogy to <hi>Fergus</hi> the
First: Which Custom was most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
us'd at the Coronation of
King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> at which
time their Pictures were expos'd,
and noblest Actions recited.</p>
            <p>As also the reciting of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy
was usual at the Burial of
ours Kings, a written Proof of
which Tradition, is to be seen in a
Manuscript of <hi>Baldredus Abbas Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis;</hi>
(for that which is the Abba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Melros,</hi> was so called before
King <hi>David</hi>'s time, who designs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59981:23"/>
them so in the Foundations of the
Lands of <hi>Melros,</hi> which he gives
to them) and is related <hi>verbatim</hi> by
<hi>Fordon,</hi> consisting of eighteen Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
mentioning the memorable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of King <hi>David,</hi> upon whom
the Lamentation is made, who died
1151; and running up the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of the said St. <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Fergus</hi>
the First, dedicated to <hi>Henry</hi> Prince
of <hi>England,</hi> Grand Nephew to
St. <hi>David,</hi> who came to the Crown
of <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1154, under the
name of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second: In both
which at least <hi>Fordon</hi> is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
having sufficient Vouchers.
This also being ordinary in our
High-land Families to this very day,
not only at Burials, but Baptisms
and Marriages: and in which Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
Men continue still to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
from their Fathers, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
and very many Generations
upwards; as is a sufficient Historical
Proof of Tradition, tho we had no
other Warrant for those few Ages.</p>
            <p>Before I come to clear that we
had Manuscripts and Records,<note place="margin">SECT. 3.</note> it is
fit to consider that is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Proofs from Manuscripts and Records.</note>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59981:23"/>
that as the History of most Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
was preserv'd by their Priests
and Church-men: so ours would
be very ready to oblige the Kings,
under whom, and the People among
whom they liv'd, by writing their
Annals. And therefore we may
reasonably conclude, that since we
were very early Christians, we had
therefore ancient Histories written
by our Church-men, besides those
which we may pretend to have been
transmitted to them by the <hi>Druids.</hi>
And the Bishop himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that the Monastery of <hi>Hy,</hi>
call'd by us <hi>Icolm-kill,</hi> (that is <hi>Hy,</hi>
the Cell of <hi>Columba</hi>) was founded
about the year 560; and it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
that 48 of our old Kings
were buried, and our Records were
kept there since its Foundation,
until the Reign of <hi>Malcolm Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more:</hi>
and it is also certain, that our
Annals were written in our Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
such as <hi>Scoon, Pasley, Plus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardin,</hi>
and <hi>Lindesfern</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Beda passim.</note> govern'd
by three <hi>Scotish-Bishops, Aidan, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi>
and <hi>Colman;</hi> and <hi>Abercorn,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 26.</note>
               <hi>Beda;</hi> and <hi>Melross,</hi> the
Chronicle whereof begins where
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59981:24"/>
               <hi>Beda</hi> ends, as their History now
printed shews: though certainly
that <hi>English</hi> Manuscript is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful,
for most of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to our Nation are omitted,
as particularly about the beginning,
in the year 844. Our Manuscript
observes (which the <hi>English</hi> has not)
<hi>That</hi> Alpin <hi>King of the</hi> Scots <hi>died,
to whom succeeded his Son</hi> Kenneth,
<hi>who beat the Picts, and was declared
first King of all</hi> Scotland, <hi>to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of</hi> Tine; and after it expresses in
his Epitaph,
<q>
                  <l>Primus in Albania fertur Regnasse Kenedhus</l>
                  <l>Filius Alpini, praelia multa gerens.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And it observes that <hi>he was called
the first King of</hi> Albany, <hi>not because
he was the first who made the Scotish
Laws, but because he was the first
King of all</hi> Scotland. And each of
our Monasteries had two Books, the
one call'd their <hi>Register,</hi> or <hi>Chartu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,</hi>
containing the Records rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

an account of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59981:24"/>
things which occur'd in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Year. And as it is strongly
presumable, that our Historians
would have compil'd our Histories
from those: So this being a matter
of Fact, is probable by Witnesses:
and I thus prove it in such a way
and manner as is sufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any History. <hi>Verimundns</hi> a
<hi>Spaniard, Arch-deacon</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1076, (as is remarked by
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 229.</note>
               <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>Ormond</hi>) declares in
the Epistle to his Book of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> dedicated to King
<hi>Malcolm,</hi> call'd <hi>Can-more;</hi> That, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
there are many things in the said
Histories, which may seem to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to be a little difficult to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
because they are not totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Foreign Historians: Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
have they heard how the</hi> Scots <hi>were
setled in the North Part of the Isle of</hi>
Albion, <hi>separated by the Sea from the
firm Land, and so seldom troubled by
Strangers, to whom they give no occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to write their Actions; and also
that they have not been less happy in
having almost always among them
the</hi> Druids, <hi>Religious People, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Chroniclers, before the Reception
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59981:25"/>
of the</hi> Christian Faith, <hi>and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
since</hi> Monks, <hi>faithful Historians
in the Isles of</hi> Man, <hi>and</hi> Icomkill;
<hi>where they kept securely their Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Antiquities, without giving
a sight, or Copy of them to strangers;
they will cease to wonder.</hi> This <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
was a Learned Man, and a Lord
of Session, who wrote <hi>anno</hi> 1572,
and in his<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> Preface, says, That <hi>he had
those principal Authors,</hi> Verimund <hi>a
Spaniard,</hi> Turgot <hi>Bishop of</hi> St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,
John Swenton, John Campbel,
<hi>and Bishop</hi> Elphinstoun, <hi>&amp;c. and
many great Histories of the Abbacies
of</hi> Scoon, <hi>called the Black-book, and
of other like Chronicles of Abbacies, as
that of</hi> Inch-colm, <hi>and</hi> Icolmkill, <hi>the
most part whereof he took pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
as much as was possible for him.</hi> He
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 24.</note>cites <hi>Verimund</hi> for an account of the
<hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> and after he also<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Pag. 94.</note>cites
him for the Miracle of St. <hi>Andrews</hi>
in <hi>Hungus</hi>'s time; and he<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 95, &amp; 96.</note>gives an
account of the tenor of the League
betwixt <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and asserts <hi>that the same was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of the Registers and Books
he mention'd,</hi> and particularly, <hi>out
of the second Book of</hi> Verimund.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59981:25"/>
Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> cites this <hi>Verimund,</hi>
among the Authors out of whom he
compiled his History; and with him
he cites <hi>Ioannes Campbellus,</hi> who
(he says) wrote the History of the
<hi>Scots</hi> from the Origine of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
till the Year 1260, in which he
liv'd: And also <hi>Turgot,</hi> who (he
says) wrote our Annals from the
beginning till the Year 1098, in
which he liv'd, (and him likewise
<hi>Hollinshed</hi> cites); as also <hi>Aluredus
Rivallensis,</hi> who wrote the History
of King <hi>David,</hi> and died <hi>Anno
1166;</hi> and <hi>Bartholomeus Anglicus,</hi>
who wrote a Chronicle of the <hi>Scots,</hi>
and liv'd in the Year 1360. Two
of which three last, we have reason to
think were <hi>Scots-men,</hi> and have been
called <hi>English-men,</hi> only because they
liv'd in the Counties which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to <hi>England,</hi> but then certainly
belong'd to us; and if they be <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
they are yet the more credible
Witnesses for us. And as the worthy
<hi>Baker</hi> says, he compil'd his History
out of these Books, which he neither
would nor could have said, if he had
not seen them: So it is very probable
that he did see them; our Records
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59981:26"/>
and Manuscripts having been indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously
carry'd to <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the First, as shall be hereafter
observ'd: Nor can it be answer'd,
that he cited them at second-hand
from <hi>Boeth,</hi> or <hi>Buchannan,</hi> for else
he had cited the other Authors whom
they cite, such as <hi>Richardus de sancto
victore, Fordon, Major,</hi> &amp;c. All this
doth evidently demonstrate that we
had such Historians as <hi>Verimund,</hi> and
the others above-cited, who asserted
before <hi>Fordon</hi> what he has related:
so that it was most unwarrantable
to say, that these things were dream'd
by <hi>Fordon</hi> and <hi>Boethius,</hi> but that
<hi>Verimund</hi> was seen and consider'd
by others, and cited in a particular
part of his Book, which could not
be copied from <hi>Boethius,</hi> because
he doth not cite <hi>Verimund</hi> for all
those Transactions; and upon this
<note n="*" place="margin">Part Post.</note>
               <hi>Balaeus,</hi> a Learn'd <hi>English-man,</hi>
hath rested. And<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Pag. 100, &amp; pag. 460.</note>
               <hi>Holinshed</hi> says,
that <hi>Verimund</hi> wrote a Book, <hi>De
Regibus Scotorum.</hi> Nor can it be
deny'd that <hi>Gesner</hi> in <hi>verbo Verimund,</hi>
and other famous Strangers, cite him
as one who has written our History
<hi>ab exordio Scoticae gentis, usque ad Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colmi
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59981:26"/>
tempora.</hi> And it is incredible
to think so good and grave a Man as
<hi>Boetius</hi> could have been so impudent
to assert in<note n="*" place="margin">Et Lib. 7.</note>his Dedication to King
<hi>Iames</hi> the 5th, <hi>That these Books were
sent to him by the Earl of</hi> Argile, <hi>and
his Brother the Thesaurer from</hi> Icolm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill,
and that, <hi>he had follow'd them in
writing his History:</hi> Especially since
he is by <hi>Erasmus</hi> that great <hi>Critick,
admir'd as a most Learned Man, they
having studied together at</hi> Paris, <hi>where
he remembers that he was in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem.</hi>
And in a Letter concerning
him, <hi>Anno</hi> 1530, inserted in the Life
of <hi>Erasmuus,</hi> he remarks, that <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius
was a Person who could not lie.</hi>
How can it then be imagined, that
he would have adventur'd to have
printed a whole <hi>Romance,</hi> and have
told his King and the World, that
he had the Manuscripts by him?
Nor is this asserted only by <hi>Boethius,</hi>
and our own Historians, but by
<hi>Paulus Iovius,</hi> a very famous Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Historian, who in his Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> says,<note n="*" place="margin">Asservantur in arcanis templi armariis vetustissimorum Annalium Codices at<expan>

the ancient Annals and Manuscripts
in hidden Presses of the Church, and
large Parchments asigned by the King's
own hands, and seal'd either with
Seals of Gold, or Wax.</hi> By which
also it appears how nice we have
been in securing the Faith of our
History, the Seals of our Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put to what was written by our
devout Church-men. And whereas
the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> to lessen
the Credit of <hi>Boethius</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 38. Pref.</note>, relates,
that <hi>Bishop Gavin Dowglas advised</hi>
Polidor Virgil <hi>not to follow his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Polidor Virgil</hi> himself is appeal'd
to, where there is no mention of
<hi>Boethius</hi> at all, nor could it be; for
<hi>Polidor</hi> regrates that <hi>Gavin Dowglas</hi>
died <hi>Anno</hi> 1520, whereas <hi>Boethius</hi>
was not publish'd till 1526, and
<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Lib. 7.</note>
               <hi>Boethius</hi> himself informs us, That
<hi>the Records from which he form'd his
History, were sent him from</hi> Icolmkill
<hi>Anno 1525, and no sooner;</hi> neither
did he see those Warrants from
which he wrote his History, till
that Year. And it appears by that
passage, that <hi>Gavin Dowglas</hi> believ'd
our account, and produc'd a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59981:27"/>
for it, which I now cite, and
use as an accessory Argument, and
prove it by the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi>
and <hi>Polidor:</hi> and whereas the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> pretends that the
<hi>Relation given by</hi> Gavin Dowglas
<hi>agreed with</hi> Nennius, <hi>but contradicted
Boethius;</hi> the contrary is probable
by <hi>Polidor</hi>'s own Relation of what
<hi>Gavin Dowglas</hi> writ to him, which
agrees with <hi>Boethius</hi> in every thing
relating to our Antiquity. The
Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> is also most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
to <hi>Boethius,</hi> in alledging that
Vossius <hi>considers him as a fabulous
Author:</hi> For <hi>Vossius</hi> commends him
from what <hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Buchannan</hi>
say of him, and in the end taxes
him only a little <hi>for having believ'd
too many Miracles,</hi> a fault incident
to most <hi>Popish Writers</hi> in those times,
but to none more than to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's
own obscure Authors, for
which, among many other Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
I refer my Reader to them
who writ the Preface to the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and
to <hi>the Life of King</hi> Alfred, and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham</hi>'s
History. It can also be
proved by many famous Gentlemen,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59981:28"/>
that the <hi>Black Book of Scoon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
our Histories from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
was among <hi>President Spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s
Books, and was given by
<hi>Lewis Cant</hi> to <hi>Major General Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
and by him to <hi>Collonel Fairfax;</hi>
which Book King <hi>Charles</hi> the first had
ransom'd from <hi>Rome</hi> by a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sum of Money. And it is
certain that <hi>Spotswood</hi> had it, and
the <hi>Black Book</hi> of <hi>Pasley,</hi> signed
by the hands of three Abbots, when
he compil'd his History: Which
Book of <hi>Pasley,</hi> together with the
famous Book of <hi>Pluscardin, Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>
says he had, and frequently cites:
and that there were such Books
is known to the whole Nation.
And I my self have seen in the
Learned Sir <hi>Robert Sibbald</hi>'s Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(to whom this Nation owes
very much) a very old Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Book of <hi>Pasley</hi> (which
Book Bp <hi>Vsher</hi> himself also cites)
agreeing in every thing with our
Histories, and which was extracted
<hi>per venerabilem virum Ioannem Gibson
Canonicum Glasguensem, &amp; Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
de Renfrew, Anno</hi> 1501. And
two other old Manuscripts, the one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59981:28"/>
called, <hi>Excerpta de Chronicis Scotiae,
&amp; Scoti-chronico,</hi> which comes to
the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> and
belong'd to Doctor <hi>Arbuthnot</hi> Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
to King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>5th;</hi> and this
proves that there were <hi>Chronica</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from <hi>Fordon</hi>'s. And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Extracta de Registro priora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Sancti-Andreae,</hi> giving the <hi>Irish</hi>
Names of our Kings. As also I
have seen a Manuscript written by a
Brother of the <hi>minores Observants</hi>
of <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1533, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
an Abridgment of our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
and whereof Doctor <hi>Sibbald</hi>
has another Copy. And there is
another old Manuscript written by
<hi>Ventonius</hi> yet extant, which <hi>Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>
also cites, and follows.</p>
            <p>Since the Writing of these Sheets,
I have seen a very old Manuscript
brought from <hi>Icolmkill,</hi> written by
<hi>Carbre Lifachair,</hi> who liv'd six Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies
before St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
our <hi>Saviours time;</hi> wherein is
given a full account of the <hi>Irish</hi>
Kings: By which I conclude, that
since the <hi>Irish</hi> had Manuscripts then,
certainly we must also be allowed to
have had them, having greater oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59981:29"/>
of learning Sciences, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Histories; because of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and polite
<hi>Britans.</hi> In this Book also there are
many Additions by the <hi>Druids</hi> of
those times: from which I likewise
may confirm that the Priests in our
old Monasteries learn'd our Ancient
History from the <hi>Druids</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
them.</p>
            <p>I have seen also an old Genealogy
of the Kings of the <hi>Albanian Scots,</hi>
agreeing with that mentioned in our
History at the Coronation of King
<hi>Alexander</hi> the 2d, and which has still
been preserv'd as Sacred there.</p>
            <p>I have also seen another old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript,
wherein the <hi>Dalreudini Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banach</hi>
are considered as setled here
six Generations before <hi>Eric,</hi> whom
<hi>Vsher</hi> calls the <hi>Father of our Kings.</hi>
I find also in it, that <hi>Angus Tuerteam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>
reign'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> five Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before our <hi>Fergus</hi> the First; and
that in his time the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Albani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
divided, and separated from one
another. Which agrees with our
Histories, which say, that the <hi>Scots</hi>
were in this Country long before
King <hi>Fergus</hi> and his Race setled here.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59981:29"/>
And these our Irish Manuscripts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in every thing with the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
History of <hi>Corbre',</hi> and are in
effect Additions to his Book by our
old <hi>Sanachies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus cleared, that there
were sufficient Warrants upon which
our Authors might have founded
their Histories; I shall in the next
place say something of our Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and make appear that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the credit and applause they
met with, and that they founded
their History on those good War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
from which <hi>Verimund, Boetius,</hi>
and <hi>Chambers</hi> are formerly prov'd to
have drawn theirs, <hi>viz.</hi> our ancient
Annals and Registers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fordon</hi> was no Monk, as the<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 26. Pref.</note> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
is pleas'd to call him, and we
had no such Monastery as <hi>Fordon:</hi>
but he was <hi>venerabilis vir dominus
Iohannes Fordon Presbyter,</hi> and is
called a <hi>Monk</hi> by the Bishop (who
studies still his own conveniency) to
make the World believe he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to lie, as the <hi>Monks</hi> are said to
have been in that Age; and to shew
him interested for the Independency
of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Culdees</hi> from <hi>Bishops.</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59981:30"/>
This Author began at least to write
before the Year 1341; for, in his
Book he speaks of that as a present
Year. This Book was so esteem'd, that
there were Copies of it in most of
our Monasteries, and one of them
we have in very old, but in fair
Characters, continued by <hi>Arelat;</hi>
another continued by a Reverend
Man, <hi>Walter Bowmaker,</hi> Abbot of
<hi>Icolmkill,</hi> and found in the custody
of one, who had preserv'd several of
the Manuscripts of that Monastery:
And both these Continuations have
drawn out our Histories to the Reign
of King <hi>Iames</hi> the 2d. And it is not
to be imagin'd that the Monasteries
would have esteem'd it so much; or
that the Abbot of that Monastery,
where our chief Annals were kept,
would have continued it, if they and
he had not known it to agree with
their Annals. And <hi>Fordon</hi> cites fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
through his Book <hi>Chronica,
&amp; alia Chronica,</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
him exactly: he cites also <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damnanus,</hi>
who liv'd before the Year
700; and <hi>Turgot</hi> Archbishop of St.
<hi>Andrews,</hi> who lived <hi>anno</hi> 1098, and
<hi>Alvared,</hi> (who dedicated his Book to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59981:30"/>
King <hi>Malcom</hi> the 3d, about the year
1057.) He cites also other foreign
Authors, such as <hi>Sigisbert,</hi> and <hi>Isidor,</hi>
and so has done all that the Bishop
requires, and all that the best Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
can do: Neither does he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Ieffrey,</hi> but contradicts him, even
in the instance of <hi>Bassianus,</hi> as shall
be cleared to conviction, in answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Bishop's Objections. He has
in him also <hi>Baldredus</hi> or <hi>Ethelredus,</hi>
and the Process before the Pope,
containing the Copies of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Letters, Objections, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,
and Answers made and sign'd
by <hi>Edward</hi> 1. and his Parliament,
and the <hi>Scotish Nobility,</hi> produc'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Pope, about the year 1300,
whereof the Copies are not only
extant from <hi>Fordon,</hi> but the Bishop
also insinuates that the Originals
themselves are extant in <hi>England,</hi>
and certainly they were at <hi>Rome.</hi>
And <hi>Fordon</hi> cites many other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
old Records: He writes in
a good Stile, and with good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and the reason why this
Work was not printed, was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it deserv'd not the Press, but
because <hi>Boethius, Buchannan,</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59981:31"/>
               <hi>Lesly</hi> having printed their Histories
in their own time, and there being
no printing in his, it was thought we
had Histories enow; which also oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
the perishing of many of our
excellent Manuscripts. But why
should the Bishop object to us <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
his not being printed, since he
cites against us Manuscripts never
cited by any, and which have been
left unprinted in a Country where
every thing is printed: and I dare
say, after exact perusal of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
Book, and of the Authors
cited by him, that <hi>Fordon</hi> is prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to all those old Legends, and
most of those Authors which he cites
against us, venerable <hi>Beda</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
who is still on our side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioannes Major</hi> was Rector of the
famous Divinity-School of <hi>Paris,</hi>
and was a Man of such Reputation
in that University, as that he is yet
remembred with esteem, and a Man
of too innocent a life, to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a Romance for a History; and he
likewise relates to <hi>Beda,</hi> and our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.

<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 30. Pref.</note>in saying, That <hi>Buchannan</hi> in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59981:32"/>
Life of <hi>Fergus</hi> the First, refers to
our old Annals, but he cites them
not; for there is no such thing in
the Life of that King: And he was
not so much a favourer of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
to have allow'd it the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of so singular an Antiquity, if
he had not found the same due to

beyond all contradiction.</p>
            <p>Bishop <hi>Lesly,</hi> and Arch-bishop
<hi>Spotswood</hi> are Men who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
our History with great judgment
and truth, and it cannot be imagin'd
that they who were indeed banish'd
for Loyalty, and suffer'd the loss of
all for their Perswasion, would have
asserted a whole bundle of Lies, or a
continued Romance, as the Author
calls our History, especially since they
had both seen <hi>Luddus,</hi> and knew
that their History would be enquired
into. And<note n="*" place="margin">Ia quibus scribendis ne Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storia lex viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, illae quae prius scripta sunt, non solum exegimus ad ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem annalium, qui in publico Regni nostri archivo, aliisque antiquissimis codicibus quos majores nostri Pasleti, Sconae, ac in aliis Monasteriis reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giose servarunt, continebantur. <hi>Lesl. paraen. ad nobil. populumque Scot.

               <hi>Lesly</hi> has the confidence
to tell in his Preface to the Nobility,
That <hi>his History had been drawn with
all the exactness that the truth of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59981:32"/>
requires from the ancient Records
of the Kingdom, and the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and he was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were carried. It is also
very pleasant to hear the Bishop of
St. <hi>Asaph</hi> inveigh against <hi>Dempster</hi>
the Jesuit, one of our Antiquaries,
whose Book certainly he had never
seen, else he would never have call'd
him a Jesuit as he<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 153.</note> does. For the
very Title of his Book bears that
he was <hi>Baro de Muiresk,</hi> and a
Lawyer, and he was indeed <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
honorarius</hi> of the Civil Law at
<hi>Bolognia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and died married,
as the History of his Life, writ by
<hi>Peteraces,</hi> bears: and we may know
by the Elogies of the greatest Wits
in <hi>Italy,</hi> how much they esteem'd
him for his extraordinary Learning,
and Parts. I may add to these, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
Camerarius de fortitudine,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Scotorum,</hi> besides <hi>Richardus de sancto
victore,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Hibernicus,</hi>
both which wrote our ancient
Histories, the last of them liv'd
in the year 1140. And they are
both follow'd by <hi>Boethius,</hi> and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Vossius, Baleus, Sixtus Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis,</hi>
and others; and also <hi>Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59981:33"/>
that wrote St. <hi>Columba</hi>'s Life.</p>
            <p>From all which it appears, that
our Historians have been Men of
great credit and esteem, and have
founded their History upon more
authentick Documents, than almost
any other Historians in the World,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Records of many Monasteries
in the time when Monasteries were
very devout, and upon the universal
Tradition of the times, both ancient
and modern; and that before there
was any competition or controversie
concerning our Antiquity; and that
what they have said, has been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
believ'd by all the learned World.
To which I shall add that our Clerk of
Registers, <hi>Skeen,</hi> the great Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
had added from those ancient
Records a Chronology of our Kings,
and which he has inserted amongst
our Acts of Parliament. Is not
then the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> much
to blame, when he would have all
this pass for a Romance, and all
those Authors to be reputed only as
one? Because, as he says, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
one another from <hi>Fordon,</hi>
and he follow'd <hi>Ieffrey;</hi> neither of
which is so. Tho I confess the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59981:33"/>
of this untruth was prety,
but happily disappointed, by their
asserting that they founded their
Histories upon the old Records of
our Monasteries, and on <hi>Turgot, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimund,</hi>
and others; all which they
had seen, and who are elder than
<hi>Fordon.</hi> And it might be as well
objected against Witnesses, that they
came in and depos'd one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
giving for the reason of their
knowledg, that they had seen what
they depos'd.</p>
            <p>If all these Manuscripts, which I
have cited were extant, I doubt
not but the Author himself would
acknowledg our Histories to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
beyond debate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if I can instruct them to have
once been, they must be reputed as
good as extant still. For both Law,
and common Reason having consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
that Papers are very subject
to be lost, and to perish; have
therefore allow'd, that if it can be
prov'd, that there were such Papers,
and that they were lost by accident,
that this probation shall supply the
loss. And I desire to know if the
Warrants of Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s History of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59981:34"/>
the Reformation had been burnt,
would not the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
have been angry, if his Testimony
and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s had not been
sufficient to prove the tenor of
them? And what have we for many
Authors, whom <hi>Livy, Iosephus,</hi> and
<hi>Herodot</hi> cite besides their own Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?
And what probation did
ever Mankind see stronger, than
that which we adduce in this case?
For first, that all our Monasteries
did write our Annals, is beside com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fame, and universal and late
Tradition, which passes over all our
Country, prov'd by the other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
above cited: If then two
ordinary Witnesses be sufficient to
prove a matter of Fact, we must much
more allow, that this matter may be
prov'd by very many Persons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
for their Devotion and
Quality. 2. There are other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts
yet extant, some whereof
I my self have seen, and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
nam'd, all agreeing with the
tenour of our History, and long
prior to <hi>Luddus</hi>'s starting of this
Debate, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. And so
must prove sufficient to support
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59981:34"/>
our Histories, and those Witnesses;
especially seeing they have nothing
in them contrary to Reason, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
credible Histories; but on the
contrary, are supported by both,
and written by Authors of great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
and Knowledg, and have
been receiv'd with great applause in
the World, and are also confirm'd
by the <hi>English</hi> Historians themselves.
And therefore I must conclude with
the Learned <hi>Vossius,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">De Hist. <hi>Lat. pag.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>That albeit the
old Monuments of</hi> Rome <hi>perisht, that
therefore the Faith of their History
should not perish with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lest it might be thought that we
our selves caus'd to destroy those
Records we now cite, to prevent
further inquiry, and to shew how
much harder it is for us than other
Nations, to be call'd to such an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
I shall desire Strangers to be
inform'd as a <hi>casus omissionis,</hi> that
our ancient Records were destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in three remarkable occasions;
1. When <hi>Edward</hi> the First took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all our Records that he could
find, having, as all Historians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
resolv'd to abolish all memory
of our Nation: and of which we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59981:35"/>
accus'd him before the Pope, and
he did not deny it. 2. When our
Monks flying to <hi>Rome</hi> at the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
carry'd with them their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.
3. By <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who carry'd
our Records into <hi>England,</hi> and many
of which were lost at Sea in their
return.</p>
            <p>But if our Historians are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,<note place="margin">SECT. 4.</note>
I hope it must be by the
Authority of far more,<note place="margin">The other Historians of this Isle cited against us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</note> and far more
credible Authors, agreeable to a
Principle of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s, the
Patron of our Bishop's Book, who
<note n="*" place="margin">Orig. Sac. p. 114. Sect. 5.</note>says, <hi>Certainly they who undertake
to contradict that which is received by
common Consent, must bring stronger
and clearer Evidence, than that on
which that Consent is grounded, or else
their Exceptions ought to be rejected
with the highest Indignation.</hi> Which
Principle, as it seems to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by Reason, so it is founded
upon the express Law of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
by which it is acknowledg'd,
that the Testimonies of Witnesses are
not to be reprobated but by others
in a double number, and who are
of far greater Authority. And
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59981:35"/>
from this Principle it is, that if a
Jury of fifteen hath absolv'd a Man
unjustly, though that Jury consisted
of the meanest Men of the Nation,
yet their Verdict cannot be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
for error, otherways than by
twenty five, whereof most part must
be Persons of Quality, who must
proceed upon most infallible grounds
and evidences. By this rule then,
our Historians cannot be redargu'd,
otherways than by the Testimonies
of far more unsuspected Historians,
who agree in what they assert a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, and who are receiv'd with
greater applause in the World than
ours, and proceed upon far stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Evidences. Let us then exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
if these Qualifications can be
found in those Historians, by whom
the faith of ours is to be overturned.
And first, as to the old <hi>British</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
it might be objected by us,
that they are too much interested,
both because the Subject Matter is
an emulation for Antiquity between
the two Nations, and because they
were over-run by our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
at that time to a degree to make
them passionate enough for disabling
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59981:36"/>
a Witness: And as it is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that <hi>Florentius Wigorniensis,
Malmesburiensis, Huntingdonensis,</hi> and
<hi>Hoveden</hi> wrote about the Reign of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Second; and <hi>Tho. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham,</hi>
and <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
in the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; at all
which times there were Wars and
Animosities betwixt the Nations.
So if any Man will read the sad
Lamentations that are in <hi>Gilda</hi>'s, and
the rage with which he cries out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, no Man can allow him to
be an unsuspected Judg or Witness
in what concerns our Honour. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidor
Virgil</hi> suspects,<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that there are
some things supposititious in the History
of Gildas;</hi> and if any thing, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we may suspect most what is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
concerning us; since the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of detracting from our History,
possest too much those who were
Masters of that Manuscript, and
printed the same. And yet <hi>Gildas</hi>
says very little that can be wrested
against us in the Points controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
being, as <hi>Beda</hi> interprets him,
clearly for us, as shall hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
2. As our Writers are not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59981:36"/>
inferiour in number, so most of theirs
deserve no credit, and they agree
not so well against us in the Points
controverted, as our Authors do in
what they assert, <hi>viz. when we setled
here,</hi> and who were <hi>our first Kings:</hi>
For<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 3. as cited by S. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph,</hi> pag. 14. Pref.</note>
               <hi>Nennius Britannus</hi> does posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
say, <hi>that the</hi> Scots <hi>came here
in the time of</hi> Brutus. <hi>Matthew</hi> of
<hi>Westminster</hi> says, that <hi>we setled here
the eleventh year after Christ.</hi> And
<hi>Baker</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> acknowledgeth that <hi>Severus</hi>
built his Wall against the <hi>Scots</hi> and
<hi>Picts,</hi> without mentioning this to be
the first incursion; and this at least
confutes the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi>
who asserts that we were not come
to this Isle even by way of incursion,
till after the year 300. As they thus
differ remarkably as to our Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and most of them follow
<hi>Ieffreys</hi> ridiculous Inventions, as our
Author himself acknowledges: So
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 16.</note>
               <hi>Holinshed,</hi> speaking of those ancient
times, says, <hi>That</hi> Scotland <hi>had in those
days two Kingdoms, the one whereof
consisted of the</hi> Picts, <hi>called</hi> Pictland;
<hi>and the other of the</hi> Irish <hi>Race, call'd</hi>
Scotland: <hi>which I hope</hi> (says he)
<hi>no wise Man will readily deny.</hi> And
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59981:37"/>
               <hi>Caixton</hi> in his old Chronicle of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
tells, that <hi>the King of the</hi> Scots
<hi>assisted</hi> Cassibelan <hi>King of the</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<hi>against</hi> Julius Caesar: which
shews that our Antiquity was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
And <hi>Balaeus,</hi> a most famous
<hi>English</hi> Chronologist, says, that<note n="*" place="margin">Bal. Pref. part post.</note>
               <hi>the</hi>
Scots <hi>wrote,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ex incorrupta annali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
Fide.</hi> 3. That our settlement was
so ancient, as not only to have been
contemporary with their Historians,
but even to be higher than their
Chronology could reach to, appears
from this, that <hi>Gildas</hi> declares<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">De excid. Brit.</note>
               <hi>he
knew nothing of us, but what he was
forc'd to borrow from beyond Sea.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 1. Beda.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
<hi>places us amongst the old Inhabitants
of this Isle,</hi> without condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon the particular time,
which he had given us, if he had
known it himself, as he did in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occasions. <hi>Nennius</hi> their next
Author to <hi>Beda</hi> owns, <hi>that the most
skillful amongst the</hi> Scots, <hi>affirm'd in
his time, that we were descended from</hi>
Scota, as our Authors now do.
<note n="*" place="margin">St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> p. 10.</note>And the eldest after him affirm,
that <hi>we are descended from</hi> Albanactus,
<hi>second Sond to</hi> Brutus. And this is
so far acknowledg'd by succeeding
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59981:37"/>
Ages, that <hi>Edward</hi> the First <hi>did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that account claim the superiority to</hi>
England <hi>over us, as younger Brother
to</hi> Locrinus <hi>the eldest Son of</hi> Brutus.
And we may see in <hi>Hollinshed,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script. Britan. cap. 8. &amp; 9.</note>
               <hi>where he brings in many</hi> Scotish
<hi>Kings doing Homage to the Kings of</hi>
Britain, <hi>long before this year</hi> 502, and
in which several of their Authors
agree with him. And the Bishop
fore-seeing the unanswerable strength
of this Argument, acknowledges <hi>this
Superiority to be a most unjust Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension,</hi>
as indeed it is; especially
seeing it is undeniable, that there
was any such thing known in the
World then, as that <hi>Feudol Homage</hi>
which the <hi>English</hi> Historians contend
for; there being no Vestige thereof
in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> till the 800
year of God, and we having had
no such Kings as some of those
whom they name in that ancient
Homage. But yet even all these
Forgeries prove clearly, that we
were consider'd by those Writers, as
Inhabitants here past all Memory,
and as ancient as themselves.<note n="*" place="margin">Girald. Camb. Distinct. 3. cap. 7.</note>
               <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus
Cambrensis</hi> also considers us <hi>as
descended from</hi> Gathelus <hi>and</hi> Scota,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59981:38"/>
which proves not only that this old
Tradition was believ'd, but that
<hi>Fordon</hi> was not the inventer of it.
For <hi>Girald</hi> liv'd about 200 years
before <hi>Fordon.</hi> But how any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
in this also can controvert
this Antiquity after <hi>Selden</hi> has asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, <hi>Lib. 2. cap.</hi> 8. I understand
not. There is likewise a very full and
well written Manuscript in the hands
of the Lord <hi>Maitland,</hi> which makes
us <hi>to come from</hi> Spain, <hi>about the year
of the World 3242, and to have been
first govern'd by Captains, and thereafter
govern'd by the Kings mention'd in our
History.</hi> 4. There are no positive
Authorities produc'd against us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
expresly when our <hi>Royal
Line</hi> did begin, save three <hi>Legendary
Stories</hi> written with design, in whom
no Protestant Bishop can find any
considerable Passages worthy to be
cited; the easiest thing in them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note n="*" place="margin">Vita St. <hi>Pat.</hi> Cap. 5.</note>
               <hi>That a Child made a Fire of
Ice;</hi>
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Vita Columb. Adamn. lib. 3. c. 16.</note> and that when St. <hi>Columba</hi>
was sick, his Mare wept.</p>
            <p>The first is a nameless Author of
St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Life, cited by<note n="*" place="margin">De Eccl. Brit. primord. p. 587.</note> 
               <hi>Vsher,</hi>
who affirms, that when <hi>Neil Neili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alagh
was King of</hi> Ireland, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59981:38"/>
was Emperor,</hi> Muredus <hi>King
of</hi> Ulster <hi>had six Sons, who possest
themselves of the Northern Parts of</hi>
Britain, <hi>and the Nation sprung from
them</hi> (as <hi>Giraldus</hi> repeating this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,

Scotland. <hi>And it may be,</hi> saith
the Bishop, <hi>Reuda</hi> mention'd by <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
was one of these six Sons.</hi> Joce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
another Author of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s
Life,<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 137.</note> tells, that <hi>the twelve Sons of
the King of</hi> Dalrieda <hi>in</hi> Ireland, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
despised their youngest Brother</hi>
Fergus, <hi>he complain'd of them to St.</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,
<hi>and he prophesied to him, that
from him should descend Kings, who
should reign in many Foreign King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
and accordingly</hi> Fergus <hi>became
King of all</hi> Dalrieda, <hi>and after his
Successors had for many Generations
reigned there,</hi> Aidanus <hi>the Son of</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branus
<hi>conquer'd</hi> Albania, <hi>now call'd</hi>
Scotland, <hi>and the other Isles, in which
his Posterity by due Succession reign
to this day. But an elder Author ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by</hi> Cambden <hi>(and whom</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 160.</note> Usher

brings the</hi> Scotish <hi>Kings from

obtain'd the Kingdom of</hi> Albania

<hi>or</hi> Brun-heir <hi>to</hi> Alphin <hi>the Son of</hi> Eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,
<hi>and with this</hi> (as the Bishop
says) <hi>the</hi> Irish <hi>Genealogies agree.</hi>
And thus our approv'd History must
be overturn'd by Legends, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies.</p>
            <p>Upon which passages I beg leave
to make these few Reflections. First,
that (besides, that these Authors
liv'd not within 600 years of the
times of which they wrote (which
the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> objects to
ours) they do also contradict not
only our Story, but the <hi>Roman,</hi>
who place us here much sooner).
All these three Authors contradict
one another in the most remarkable
part of our History, and in so late
a matter of Fact, as that of <hi>Fergus</hi>
the Second, which shews them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
faithful nor learn'd Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists.
The first nameless Author,
writer of the Life of S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> makes

               <hi>our King to have been one of the Sons
of</hi> Mured, whom <hi>Vsher</hi> conjectures
to have been <hi>Reuther,</hi> and he must
have liv'd in 360; for <hi>Constantius</hi>
reign'd then, and <hi>Mured</hi>'s Son liv'd
in his Reign. <hi>Iocelin</hi> makes <hi>Aidan</hi>
to be the first, and to have sprung
from <hi>Fergus</hi> after many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And this agrees well with ours,
but not with the other Writers of
St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Life. For we place the
beginning of <hi>Aidan</hi>'s Reign in 570,
and it could be no sooner, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Iocelin.</hi> The third is the
Author of the <hi>Tigernack Annals,</hi> or
an ancienter Writer cited by <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
who places our first King in
503, and there he is call'd <hi>Fergus;</hi>
and so they neither agree in the
name of our first King, nor in the
time of their entry to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Which dreaming Glances have
risen from an imperfect notion of
our History, the first having bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
his from <hi>Beda,</hi> who brings
us here <hi>sub duce Reuda:</hi> the second
has been invented to fulfil the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> who promis'd
the Kingdom not to <hi>Fergus</hi> himself,
but to one of his Succession, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59981:40"/>
therefore finding none of our Kings
nam'd in <hi>Beda,</hi> save <hi>Reuther</hi> and
<hi>Aidan;</hi> he fixes on <hi>Aidan</hi> as the
latest. And the third of these, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Fergus</hi> was uncontroverted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the name of our first King, will
rather contradict the rest, and go
back from <hi>Aidan</hi> to <hi>Fergus.</hi> And
thus they clensh here, making the
the first <hi>Fergus</hi> the second, as they
do elsewhere, in making <hi>Scotia</hi> to
be <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Scotia major.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Since the Bishop's Authors are
so irreconcileable, what Warrants
can he or they have to contradict
our positive History?<note n="*" place="margin">De Primord. pag. 611.</note> And Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Vsher</hi> cites another Author of
St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Life, <hi>Meyerus,</hi> who
tells us that <hi>after St.</hi> Patrick'<hi>s Voyage
about this Isle, he turn'd his Boat to an
Isle which bears to this day the name
of St.</hi> Patrick; out of which Isle I
believe the Accusers of our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
got their best Intelligence.</p>
            <p>3. That this <hi>Reuda</hi> could not be
one of <hi>Mureda</hi>'s six Sons, is most
clear, both because <hi>Beda</hi> speaks of
the <hi>Scots</hi> coming to this Isle, as very
ancient, even in his time, which
could not be if this had happen'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59981:40"/>
in <hi>Anno 360;</hi> for <hi>Beda</hi> liv'd in
<hi>Anno</hi> 730, and how can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
that <hi>Beda</hi> could not have
known the whole Series of a Royal
Descent that was so recent. Nor
do our Historians, whose Faith is
not controverted, after <hi>Fergus</hi> the
Second, mention any <hi>Reuda</hi> after
his Reign: and so he behov'd to
be an elder King, and consequently
we had King's before <hi>Fergus</hi> the
Second, which the Authors denies.
Nor could any of these Sons of
<hi>Mured</hi> have been <hi>Fergus</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
whom these late Inventors
call our first King; for no Author
makes <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second to have
reign'd within more than 40 Years
after <hi>Constantius. Luddus</hi> and <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
assert us to have setl'd here, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Fergus</hi> the Second, in the Reign
of <hi>Honorius,</hi> at which time <hi>Fergus</hi>
the Second did reign. <hi>Vsher</hi> relates
only the three Authorities of those
ridiculous Legends; and the Bishop
of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> fixes on the year 503,
and so contradicts not only our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
but<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 62.</note> 
               <hi>Luddus</hi> and<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Cap. Scoti.</note> 
               <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>

               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:59981:41"/>
As these few prime and late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
who controvert our Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
differ thus in the names of our
first Kings, and the time of their
settlement in <hi>Scotland;</hi> so they differ
in these following cardinal Points of
their new invented Hypothesis. The
Bishop of<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> St. <hi>Asaph</hi> thinks it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for maintaining that the <hi>Scots</hi>
setl'd not till the year 503, to assert
that <hi>the</hi> Picts <hi>fill'd all the Northern
Parts of</hi> Britain, <hi>and that those</hi> Picts
<hi>were a ruder sort of</hi> Britains, <hi>divided in</hi>
South <hi>and</hi> North Picts; in which
he follows<note n="*" place="margin">Camb. Cap. Pict.</note> 
               <hi>Cambden,</hi> yet with this
difference, implying a contradiction,
that <hi>Cambden</hi> makes these <hi>Deucaledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Vecturiones,</hi> to signify by a
<hi>British</hi> derivation, <hi>Picts,</hi> to the <hi>East
and West:</hi> Whereas the Bishop of
St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> from a <hi>British</hi> derivation
of the same words, calls them <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
and <hi>Northern Picts.</hi> But <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
does acknowledge plainly that in
this Derivation, he differs from the
venerable <hi>Beda,</hi> whose Authority
he truly foretels will weigh down
the Reasons he brings for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.
And as he, contrary to the
universally receiv'd opinion, denies
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59981:41"/>
the <hi>Picts</hi> to be <hi>Schythians,</hi> tho they
were really so, he makes the <hi>Scots</hi>
to be <hi>Schythians,</hi> though really they
were not so.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">De Primord. cap. 11. init.</note>
               <hi>Vsher</hi> not having considered all
the Scheme and Consequences of
this new Hypothesis (as the Bishop
of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> has done with more
cunning) follows <hi>Beda</hi> in bringing
the <hi>Picts</hi> from <hi>Schythia,</hi> but he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from <hi>Beda</hi> in that he brings
them hither after our Saviour's Birth,
and produces such Authors as he
uses in our occasions, who assign
three different Periods of time for
their settlement; the last whereof,
and to which he inclines, is said to
be under the Emperours <hi>Gratian</hi> and
<hi>Valentinian;</hi> and so makes the <hi>Scots</hi>
and <hi>Picts</hi> to have come in together
about the year 400, and yet he
finds no inconveniency in bringing
us to <hi>Scotland</hi> under <hi>Gathelus</hi> and
<hi>Scota,</hi> and in asserting that we setled
first in <hi>Galloway,</hi> whereas none of
our Historians do say that <hi>Gathelus</hi>
and <hi>Scota</hi> came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> and <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
assert our descent from <hi>Scota</hi> to
be a Fiction; and the Bishop of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59981:42"/>
St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> confesses us to have <hi>first
fixt in</hi> Argile.</p>
            <p>Another material difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them is, that the Bishop of
St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Cap. 1. Sect. 12, &amp; 13.</note> confines us and the <hi>Picts,</hi>
for 1000 years be-north <hi>Grahams
Dike,</hi> call'd <hi>Severus Wall,</hi> beyond
<hi>Clyde</hi> and <hi>Forth.</hi> Whereas <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
               <note n="‚Äñ" place="margin">Cap. Pict.</note>asserts that <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was the
chief Seat of the Kings of the <hi>Picts,</hi>
and derives the names of <hi>Louthian,
Edingburgh,</hi> and <hi>Pictland,</hi> from
<hi>Pictish</hi> words.</p>
            <p>From all which it clearly appears,
that no weight is to be laid on such
irreconcileable Authors; and yet
by these only, is the Antiquity of
of our Kings and Nation contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
But to confirm fully our
History from <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s time, and
to shew that the <hi>British</hi> Historians
do not only contradict one another,
but do contradict the two only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Historians, who could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
any thing of our Origine, as
being the eldest and most deserving
of all their own Authors, <hi>viz. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
and <hi>Beda;</hi> I do appeal to them.
And I begin with <hi>Beda,</hi> because he
is most full, and interprets the other.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59981:42"/>
The venerable <hi>Beda,</hi> tho a <hi>Saxon</hi>
himself, and so an Enemy to us,
having written an exact Chronology,
according to the periods of time;
does in his first <hi>cap. de</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Quinque gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium linguis u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam eandemque summoe veritatis, &amp; verae subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatis scientiam scrutatur, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetur <hi>Anglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> viz. <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonum, Scoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bed.</hi> l. 1. cap. 1. Eccl. Hist.</note> 
               <hi>priscis incolis,</hi>
tell us, that God <hi>was praised in five
languages in this Isle, that of the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
Britains, Scots, Picts, <hi>and</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines:
and then proceeds to tell, that
<hi>the</hi> Britains <hi>were the first possessors, and
possest the south parts, after which came
the</hi> Picts <hi>to the northern parts, and the</hi>
Scots <hi>under</hi> Reuda, <hi>thereafter made a
third Nation, in that part belonging to
the</hi> Picts, getting the <hi>western</hi> part of
<hi>Scotland, North</hi> from the <hi>Picts,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Dumbriton,</hi> or <hi>Alcluith.</hi> And
he inculcates their fixing here, by
three several, but concuring Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.
1. <hi>Progressi ex Hibernia,
they left</hi> Ireland. 2. <hi>Sedes vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
in Britannia, they setled in</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
3. <hi>In Britannia Britonibus &amp;
Pict is gentem tertiam addiderunt,</hi> they
<hi>added a third Nation to the</hi> Britains
<hi>and</hi> Picts. And that this was very
ancient is clear; for he fixes them
in <hi>Britain</hi> in that Chapter wherein
he treats <hi>de priscis incolis;</hi> and having
thus setled the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> in his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59981:43"/>
first Chapter with the <hi>Britains;</hi> he
proceeds in the second Chapter to
settle the fourth Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
or <hi>Romans,</hi> beginning with
these words,<note n="*" place="margin">Verum eadem Britannia Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis usque ad Caium <hi>Jul. Caes.</hi> inaccessa atque in cognita fuit <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> Hist. Eccles. l. 1. cap. 2.</note> 
               <hi>But this Britain was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
and not entred upon by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
till</hi> Julius Caesar'<hi>s time.</hi> And
having describ'd the Wars betwixt
these three Nations and the <hi>Roman
Emperours,</hi> in a due gradation, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every period of time through
the Reign of their consecutive <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors;</hi>
and how at last the <hi>Romans</hi>
had abandon'd the <hi>Island,</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi>
the <hi>Roman Consul,</hi> had refus'd the
Petition of the miserable <hi>Britains,</hi>
so often defeated by the <hi>Scots</hi> and
<hi>Picts:</hi> he in the 14 <hi>Cap.</hi> relates how
the <hi>Britains</hi> upon deep consultation,
brought in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and from
thence continues the <hi>Saxon</hi> History.
This being the tract of <hi>Beda</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;
Is there any place to doubt
but that the <hi>Scots</hi> were setled before
the <hi>Saxons?</hi> For the Wars betwixt
the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> are related ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
before any mention is made of
the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and at last they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought in to assist the <hi>Britains</hi>
against the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> because
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59981:43"/>
the <hi>Britains</hi> were deserted by the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and consequently the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
having been brought in <hi>Anno
449,</hi> it unanswerably follows, that
the <hi>Scots</hi> were setl'd here, and made
a third Nation, long before the 503,
as the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> alledges,
at which time he makes us to have
setl'd here very cunningly, but not
sincerely, upon design to make us
later than the <hi>English.</hi> As also it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
very clearly that the <hi>Scots</hi> setl'd
here even before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s time,
for after <hi>Beda</hi> (who proceeds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
according to the Periods of
Time) had setl'd us in <hi>Britain,</hi> he
tells,<note n="*" place="margin">Verum eadem Britannia Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis usque ad Caium <hi>Julius Caes.</hi> inaccessa atque incognita fuit. <hi>Beda</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Hist. l. 1. cap. 2.</note> that <hi>this</hi> Britain <hi>was unknown
to the</hi> Romans, and describ'd what
these <hi>Romans</hi> did in the Isle, and
how they fought with the <hi>Picts</hi>
and <hi>Vs</hi> under their subsequent <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi>
without ever speaking again
of the entry of the <hi>Scots,</hi> as having
setl'd them in the first Chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Caesar's</hi> time. Nor is the time
alter'd in any other Period; and he
is so careful of the Period of time,
that he subjoyns to his Work a
Chronological Recapitulation, which
is very exact. And he being a <hi>Saxon,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59981:44"/>
had certainly told (as the Bishop
now does) that the <hi>Saxons</hi> were
elder than we, if this had been true;
which is a demonstration according
to the Rules of Chronology, against
the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph.</hi> It may be
some may wonder why <hi>Beda</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not our coming under <hi>Fergus</hi>
the first; and some may object, that
in this we go higher than <hi>Beda.</hi>
To which it is answered, That our
History confesses, that the <hi>Scots</hi> came
over from <hi>Ireland</hi> at several times:
Once under <hi>Fergus</hi> the first, but
not being numerous enough, <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therus</hi>
brought over another recruit,
and thereafter <hi>Fergus</hi> the second
brought over others after his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor
<hi>Eugenius</hi> was expell'd by
the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Britains.</hi> And
in so old Antiquity, it's much for
<hi>Beda,</hi> even to know the Descent
under <hi>Reuda.</hi> And whereas the
Bishop quarrels <hi>Beda,</hi> that he gives
no Authority for this: The Reply
is, that if it were requisite, then one
Author behov'd to give another,
and he a third, <hi>&amp; sic in infinitum.</hi>
Nor did ever any Man before him
require an Authority in so ancient
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59981:44"/>
an Author: and this Answer is a full
proof of the Bishop's Conviction,
who being absolutely gravel'd here,
he grows as angry at <hi>Beda,</hi> as at
our Historians, and tells, disdainfully,
that <hi>this might be true for ought</hi> Beda
<hi>knew,</hi> and adds, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were
indeed here in <hi>Beda</hi>'s time, and he
speaks according to his own time,
which were to make <hi>Beda</hi> speak
great non-sense. For <hi>Beda</hi> speaks
here of the <hi>preterit,</hi> and not the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
time, <hi>viz.</hi> The first Vastations
spoke of by <hi>Gildas,</hi> and we shall see
that others, who lived in the time
agree with him.</p>
            <p>The second Citation I shall bring
from <hi>Beda,</hi> shall be from the <hi>5th cap.

because they liv'd, and were setled out of</hi>
Britain; <hi>but because they were separated
from that part of</hi> Britain <hi>by the two
Seas, which did almost meet.</hi> And in
this he agrees exactly with <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
who in the Life of <hi>Agricola,</hi> says, that
<hi>there being a Wall built betwixt these
two Seas, the Roman Enemies were clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up as in an Isle.</hi> By this place of
<hi>Beda</hi> it is also very clear, that the
<hi>Scots</hi> were setled in <hi>Britain</hi> whilst
the <hi>Romans</hi> fought against the <hi>Picts</hi>
and <hi>Scots,</hi> and consequently before
they were call'd by the <hi>Picts</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them against the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as is
alledged by the <hi>Bishop.</hi> If the <hi>Scots</hi>
had not been living in this Isle at
that time, the explication of <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine</hi>
had been both ridiculous and
untrue. And as it is not presumable
that the venerable <hi>Beda</hi> would have
asserted this, if he had not certainly
known it; so it was very easy for
him to know it, that being so publick
a thing, which concern'd his own,
as well as his Neighbour Nation. But
if the <hi>Scots</hi> had setled in <hi>anno 503,
Beda</hi> could not have call'd them
<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note>
               <hi>Prisci incolae,</hi> and reckon'd them
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59981:45"/>
amongst the ancient Inhabitants. For
a Man living in his time, might have
told him, that his Father saw the
<hi>Scots</hi> call'd over by the <hi>Picts,</hi> and
that they settled here in his time.
<hi>Beda</hi> being thus clear to a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
as far as Chronology and
History can allow: I desire to know
how what <hi>Gildas</hi> says, can contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
our History, since he copies
<hi>Gildas,</hi> and liv'd within 200 years
of him? and since both wrote the
same Actions in almost the same
words? Or how can it be imagin'd,
that if <hi>Gildas</hi> had known our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin
to be so late, he would not have
told it to our disadvantage? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the contrary, he speaks of
<hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> as living in this Isle,
after the same manner as <hi>Transmarine,</hi>
in the same sense, in which <hi>Beda</hi>
interprets it; which is, because they
liv'd not without the Isle, but on
the other side of the Wall, which
made an Isle. From which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
necessarily that in <hi>Gildas</hi>'s time,
the <hi>Scots</hi> dwelt not without the Isle

Clenshes and Equivocations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
weak Consequences, without
Authors living at the time, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
expressly so remarkable an
Accident.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon Foreign Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
without the Isle,<note place="margin">SECT. 5. Proofs from Foreign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</note> I must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that we having kept the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
(the only writing Nation that
had any knowledg of these our
Isles) from entering our Kingdom;
they could not know our Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as they did those of <hi>England</hi> or
<hi>France,</hi> whom they had conquer'd.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59981:46"/>
But our being engag'd in a constant
War with them, is so universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by all their Historians; that
to deny our being a Nation, and in
<hi>Britain,</hi> when they so frequently
and unanimously writ of us, <hi>as
Gens, &amp; Gens etiam Britannica,</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here, cannot but seem Railery
to any Serious Man: and the being
able to controvert it, is rather a
mark of nimbleness of Wit, than
skill in Antiquity. But however I
shall produce some few Foreign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
whose Testimonies seem to
me unanswerable, being joyn'd with,
and illustrated by what I formerly
said from the venerable <hi>Beda,</hi> and
the Historians within this Isle.</p>
            <p>My first Author is <hi>Eumenius</hi> in his
<hi>Panegyrick</hi> to <hi>Constantine</hi> in praise
of his Father <hi>Constantius:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eumenius.</note> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the Victory <hi>Constantius</hi> had
over the <hi>Britains,</hi> to that which <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caesar</hi> had over them; says,<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 258.</note> 
               <hi>that
the</hi> Britains <hi>at the time</hi> Caesar <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
them, were a rude Nation, being
only us'd to fight against the</hi> Picts, <hi>and</hi>
Irish <hi>of the</hi> British Country, <hi>Enemies
half naked, and so easily yeilded to
the</hi> Roman <hi>Arms and Ensigns.</hi> By
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59981:47"/>
which Citation, we contend that it is
prov'd, that in the time of <hi>Iulius
Caesar,</hi> there was another Nation
beside the <hi>Picts,</hi> who then inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Britain,</hi> and were a Colony of
the <hi>Irish;</hi> and these must certainly
have been the <hi>Scots.</hi> For it cannot
be pretended, that ever there was
another Colony of the <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
besides us. And it is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
on all hands, that we are
that Colony of the <hi>Irish,</hi> who only
us'd to fight with the <hi>Picts,</hi> against
the <hi>Britains,</hi> and therefore that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
made by the Bishop, that this
place relates only to the <hi>Irish,</hi> and
not to the <hi>Scots,</hi> is of no moment.
But he has another Answer, which
his Lordship insists more upon; and
for clearing whereof, I must cite the
Latin; <hi>Ad hoc natio etiam tunc ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,
&amp; soli</hi> Britanni Pictis <hi>modo, &amp;</hi>
Hibernis <hi>assueta hostibus, adhuc semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nudis,
facile</hi> Romanis <hi>armis signisque
cesserunt.</hi> His Answer is, that the
words, <hi>Soli Britanni,</hi> are the Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native,
and not the Genitive, and
his Lordship confesses,<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> 
               <hi>that if the
words be in the Genitive,</hi> they are
clear of <hi>Buchannan</hi>'s side. And that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59981:47"/>
they are of the Genitive, all disinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
Men, who understand the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
will confess. And <hi>Cambden</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
tho a learned Schoolmaster, and
in other Citations about our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
somewhat more humourous,
than so worthy a Man needed to be,
trusts to no other Answer, but that
the Panegyrist spoke here, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Conception of the Age
wherein he liv'd. But, as any Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be thus answered; so if he
had not spoken with relation to the
time of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Complement had no great
force. The Learned <hi>Vsher</hi> likewise
objects not this to <hi>Buchannan,</hi> which
shews also his Acquiescence. 2. If
this, <hi>Natio Rudis,</hi> had been the same
thing with <hi>Soli Britanni;</hi> and if the
sence must be, as his Lordship says,
a <hi>Rude Nation, the Britains;</hi> then
not only it had been superfluous, but
inconsistent with true sence. For
how can the same thing be copulated
with it-self? and tho it may be said,
<hi>Natio rudis Soli Britanni, assueta ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibus;</hi>
yet certainly <hi>assueti</hi> had been
more elegant for an Orator, if <hi>Soli
Britanni</hi> had been the Nominative.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59981:48"/>
And the great<note n="*" place="margin">In not. in lib. 4. Tibull.</note>
               <hi>Ioseph Scaliger,</hi> one
of the best Judges both for that kind
of Learning and Disinteressedness,
exclaims against <hi>Luddus,</hi> for miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
so the words; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Bishop might have spared
the saying,<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 11.</note>
               <hi>that</hi> Cambden <hi>ought to
have given</hi> Buchannan <hi>correction;</hi> for
the great <hi>Ioseph Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi>
that incomparable <hi>Humanist,</hi>
are fitter to give, than receive Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from any in the Isle, or Age.</p>
            <p>I must also observe, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
has pointed these words other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
than they are in the Author:
for in the Author (of <hi>Paulus Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,</hi>
and <hi>Plantins</hi> Editions, who
were the most learned and exact of
all Printers) there is no <hi>Comma</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after tthe words, <hi>Soli Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanni,</hi>
and it is pointed as I have
set it down here, and even<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 37.</note>
               <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
is just here. But the Bishop has
very wittily added the <hi>Comma</hi> after
these words. Now without the
<hi>Comma,</hi> it is clear, that the <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist</hi>
meant <hi>Pictis &amp; Hibernis Soli Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanni;</hi>
and if the <hi>Panegyrist</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
his words should have been
construed, as the Bishop has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stru'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59981:48"/>
them; so great an Orator
would certainly have said, <hi>Soli Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanni
Natio ad hoc etiam tunc ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
&amp;c. And in this case the words
had been clear, and the ingenious
Bishop needed not, in translating
them, to have been forc'd to use
the word<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Nation</hi> twice, because
the sense was hard and unnatural,
according to his Construction. And
whereas the Bishop pretends,<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. <hi>ibia.</hi>
               </note> that
<hi>the words construed according to</hi> Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>channan,
<hi>would not have run so strong
in the Comparison: for the strength of
the Comparison lies,</hi> saith he, <hi>in that</hi>
Julius Caesar'<hi>s Victory was not so great,
as that of</hi> Constantius, <hi>because</hi> Caesar
<hi>overcame a Nation, yet rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
of War, and only</hi> Britains, <hi>a
Nation us'd to no other Enemies but</hi>
Picts <hi>and</hi> Irish: Whereas <hi>Constantius</hi>
overcame <hi>Carausius,</hi> who had got
a <hi>Roman Legion</hi> on his side, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But by his Lordship's favour, the
Comparison runs strong enough
thus, according to <hi>Buchannan</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
Caesar <hi>overcame the</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<hi>when they were yet a rude Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
us'd only to fight against the</hi> Picts
<hi>and</hi> Irish <hi>who liv'd upon the Land, or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59981:49"/>
Isle of</hi> Britain: <hi>but</hi> Constantius <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them after they had been long
train'd up in War.</hi> And certainly a
Nation is a far more formidable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
after their being long train'd up
in War, than when yet rude, and
unexperienc'd; tho they had had the
accession of a <hi>Roman Legion;</hi> which
could signify nothing against a whole
<hi>Roman Army.</hi> Nor does it follow,
that the words must be ill construed;
if so, the Comparison would be
stronger: for it is sufficient to sustain
the Construction, that in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<hi>Constantius</hi> was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
in the way I have mention'd.
4. If there were any doubtfulness
in these words, as there is none; yet
they ought to be interpreted so,
as to consist with other Authors
and Histories, and especially with
<hi>Beda:</hi> for in our sence, they confirm
his Chronological Account, of our
being in this Isle before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s
time: And the Bishop must still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that he cannot overturn
our receiv'd Histories, except he
produce Arguments which infallibly
conclude against them: It being a
Rule in Law, that, <hi>Verba semper sunt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59981:49"/>
interpretanda potius, ut scriptura, vel
actus subsistat; quam ut destruatur.</hi>
This shews also that in <hi>Constantius</hi>'s
time, which was about the Year
300, the <hi>Britains</hi> were <hi>assueti, us'd
to fight</hi> with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts:</hi>
and this use must imply a long time.
And so it's very probable, that we
had frequent Wars with the <hi>Britains</hi>
long before this time, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Bishop errs,<note n="*" place="margin">Sect. 5, 6. cap. 1.</note> asserting,
<hi>We were not in</hi> Britain <hi>even by way of
incursion, till the year</hi> 300. If it be
objected, that in the Phrase <hi>Soli Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanni,
Britanni</hi> is a Substantive;
<hi>Britannici</hi> being still the Adjective;
and therefore these words must be
construed to be the Nominative
Case, as the Bp of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> alledgeth.
I prove the contrary by <hi>Lucretius.</hi>

            <p>A further Confirmation of this
arises from the same <hi>Eumenius,</hi> in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59981:50"/>

            <p>Having thus shown that the <hi>Scots</hi>

than to those two, who are

a Book concerning the <hi>Roman</hi>
Greatness,<note n="*" place="margin">Petruccio Vbaldini, <hi>also in</hi> descritt. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Scotia, <hi>p. 4. &amp; 5. asserts the</hi> Scots <hi>to be</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledonians.</note> and the other concerning
the Magnificence of the <hi>Romans</hi>
in their High-ways. Nor could he
be an <hi>Irish</hi> King; for what had an

Agricola <hi>having beat</hi> Galgacus <hi>near

that <hi>Galgacus</hi> was no <hi>Britan:</hi> For

new Nations:</hi> whereas <hi>Agricola</hi>

for they could not be any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beyond the River <hi>Tay.</hi> And
<hi>Galgacus</hi> could be no <hi>Pictish</hi> King;
for we have a Manuscript, bearing
all the Names of the Pictish Kings.
2. From this passage it is clear, that
<hi>Cambden</hi> does err grosly, in making
the <hi>Horesti</hi> to be a People in <hi>Eskdale,</hi>
which is a Scotish Country on the

            <p>That all this is applicable to us,
is clear: because, 1. We had War
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> had
not. And all these Verses in <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>

man Conquest. 2. Since we have
prov'd, by other Authors, that the
Scots were setled here, it is proper
and suitable to common sense, to
apply the same to us only, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the only Persons concern'd in
those Battels; and to the Isle, in
which it is known that the same
were fought. And these Passages
are attributed to us by <hi>Selden,</hi> l. 2.

            </p>
            <p>3. Have the Irish made any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this War, in any of their
Histories? and consequently, though
<hi>Scotia</hi> had been a common Name to
<hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in those days;
yet the Circumstances of the Action,
related by the Poet, determine which
of the two is here meant.</p>
            <p>This is yet further clear from the
Panegyrick of <hi>Sidonius Appollinaris.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>‚Äî<hi>Victricia</hi> Caesar</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As to which, all that <hi>cambden</hi>
(much better acquainted with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59981:55"/>
than reasoning) can answer;
is, 1. That <hi>the Poet here wrote a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
according to the vulgar Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his own Times, which cannot
be true,</hi> (as he says) <hi>because the</hi>
Saxons <hi>were not then come to</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
But he should have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that, 1. If this was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in <hi>Sidonius</hi>'s Age, who liv'd
<hi>Anno</hi> 480,<note n="*" place="margin">Gesner <hi>in</hi> verb. Sidonius.</note> as <hi>Gesner</hi> affirms, which
was very near to <hi>Claudian</hi>'s Time,
who liv'd in 497, as the Bishop
of<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> St. <hi>Asaph</hi> calculates: we must
conclude, that it is the rather to be
believ'd, that then the Scots liv'd
here, for that is not inconsistent with
History as the other is, and so should
be believ'd, though the other be not.
2. There were <hi>Saxons</hi> living then
in <hi>Zetland</hi> or <hi>Orknes,</hi> tho they were
not setled in <hi>Britain;</hi> as is clear by
<hi>Claudian</hi> himself, who says‚Äî
<q>Maduerunt Saxone fuso <hi>Orcades.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas it is said, that
<q>‚ÄîFlevit glacialis Ierne,</q>
            </p>
            <p>Does make the same applicable to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59981:56"/>
since <hi>Ierna</hi> is call'd <hi>Ireland.</hi> To
this it is answered, that, 1. It is clear,
that there is a Country in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
call'd <hi>Ierna,</hi> near to which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
had a noble Camp, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Vestiges are very remarkable
to this day; and in which, there
are Stones found with Roman In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,
designing the Stations
of the Legions. And certainly it
is more proper to say, the loss was
lamented in that Country where
the Battel was fought, than in that
Kingdom where the Romans never
fought any. And why did the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
join <hi>Ierna</hi> in the same lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with <hi>Caledonia?</hi> if he had not
design'd by it, to express <hi>Ierna,</hi> as
a part of our <hi>Scotland.</hi> And this
is more proper, than to make the
Poet join part of one, to another
different, and remote Kingdom.
As also <hi>Starthern</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a place, where the Frost is
strong, and continues long, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very near the Hills. But <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was known to be, and is yet a
Country much freer from Storms
and Ice; and was believ'd by the
Ancients to be so, as is most clear
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59981:56"/>
by<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Beda.</hi> 2. Though the Poet
had understood <hi>Ireland,</hi> by <hi>Ierne;</hi>
yet it does not follow, that because
<hi>Ireland</hi> lamented the loss of the
Scots who were kill'd here; that
therefore the Scots that were kill'd,
were not the Scots that were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Scotland:</hi> since certainly, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
could not but have lamented
even the death of Scots, who were
setled here; as <hi>Scotland,</hi> and as the
Scots here did lament very much
the death of the Scots who were
kill'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the late Massacre.
And as the Bishop himself argues in
the Case of the <hi>Panegyrick</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
I may far more justly argue
here, that this sense agrees better
with the Poet's noble flight, who
makes the loss that the Scots
sustained to be so great, that it was
lamented even in <hi>Ireland. Selden</hi>
also, <hi>l. 2. c. 8. Mar. Claus.</hi> applys this
to us, and not to the Irish. And
these Verses in the same Author,
design'd likewise to the praise of the
same <hi>Theodosius,</hi>

lies North-west from <hi>Clyde,</hi> or

as if the <hi>Scotia</hi> here spoke
of, were joyn'd to no other place;
and that is only applicable to <hi>Ireland,</hi>

expressions, <hi>which is not joyn'd to the

               <hi>Ben gorion</hi> says to

if ever <hi>Ireland</hi> was invaded by the
<hi>Romans?</hi> So that what is said in the
harangue, is not applicable to the
<hi>Scotia Hibernica,</hi> as they pretend;
but to that Country wherein we
now live. As also, by the same
<hi>Ben-gorion,</hi> it is clear, that <hi>Nero</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discourag'd upon the rebellion of
the <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Vespasian</hi> comming to
him, comforted him, by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
him that <hi>some of his Captains
had conquer'd all the Western World,</hi>
France, Scotland, <hi>and the land of</hi>
Tubal. And whereas, <hi>Vsher,</hi> to
lessen this Authority, is forc'd to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59981:58"/>
that <hi>Hegesippus</hi>'s Works were
spurious. This contradicts<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. cap. 27. l. 4. <hi>Euseb.</hi> Eccl. Hist.</note> 
               <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
who makes him to have liv'd,

contends, that both these Authors
must be late, because <hi>Hegesippus,</hi>
who only cites <hi>Ben-gorion,</hi> names
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> which chang'd not
the name of <hi>Bizantium</hi> till about
the beginning of the <hi>4th</hi> Century.
Yet the Answer is easie, <hi>viz.</hi> That
this being a Translation from the
<hi>Greek,</hi> the Translator has us'd the
name that was best known in his
own Time. And the English, and
other Nations have acknowledg'd
this to be the Work of <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> and
translate it as such. <hi>Vsher</hi> himself
indeed is inclin'd to think, that this
was the Work of <hi>St. Ambrose:</hi> but
even that is sufficient for us, for not
only is <hi>St. Ambrose</hi> himself older than
the 503 Year, and so proves that our
Country was before that time called
<hi>Scotland;</hi> but <hi>St. Ambrose</hi> relating

the honour of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi>
which he was defending, That <hi>those
Inhabitants of</hi> Britain, <hi>which could
not be subdu'd by the</hi> Romans, <hi>yet
willingly yielded to the Yoke of Christ.</hi>
From which it is urg'd, that in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>'s
Time, there were Nations in
<hi>Britain</hi> which had never submitted
to the Roman Yoke, but yet submitted
to the Yoke of Christ. But so it is
that could not be meant of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
for all the World knows, and
the Bishop confesses, that long before
that Time, they had submitted to
the Romans. And therefore it is
plain, that there were other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Isle; and that could
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59981:59"/>
not be true, except the Scots, as
well as the Picts, had been setled
in the Isle at that Time. For a
vagrant Company of Robbers, could
not be call'd a Nation, or esteem'd
a Church: And this Author writes
of British Nations; we must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have been a Nation and Church,
as the rest were; and therefore,
since they were setled, so must we
have been. Nor can this be meant
of the North and South Picts,
though it were prov'd, that the Picts
were distinguish'd into Northern
and Southern. For these could no
more be consider'd as different
People, than the Northern and Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
English can now be said to be
different Nations. 2. That sense
was not so much for the honour
and extent of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And the Jews might have lookt
upon <hi>Tertullian</hi> as a Jugler, for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one Nation appear two. 3. Our
sense agrees better with <hi>Beda,</hi> who
asserts positively, that from <hi>Reudas</hi>'s
Time, the Scots made a third Nation
in the Isle of <hi>Britain,</hi> with the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>

               <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> who wrote
about the Year 360, tells us, That
the Scots and Picts harrased the
Country. But the Bishop unjustly
adds, that then they first harrassed it.
But this cannot be, for <hi>Ammianus</hi>
speaks of their Fear, as occasion'd by
a Tract of bygon Defeats; and this
he elegantly expresses by the words,
<hi>congerie praeteritarum Cladium;</hi> which
shews, that these he speaks of in the
360, were not the first of many
overthrows that the <hi>Brittains</hi> had

            <p>Having thus made plain the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of our Kings and Nation from<note place="margin">SECT. 6. Proofs from Reason.</note>
the Historians both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Isle. I now proceed to
clear these from the Principles of
sound Reason: As to which, let us
consider, That it being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
by <hi>Vsher,</hi> and the Authors
he cites, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was peopl'd
by the Scots, before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s
Time; and by their own Authors,
whom that Bishop cites, they are
said to have been so anciently there,
that we do not know how many
Ages they possess'd that Isle before
<hi>Iulius Caesar.</hi> And they being a
very broody People, as all Northen
Nations, and particularly they, and
we are, could not but have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
so exceedingly, as to need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and evacuation by Colonies.
And it can never be pretended, that
the Irish did settle any other Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59981:62"/>
save in <hi>Britain:</hi> though it be
undenyable, that all those Northen
Nations were very desirous and
concern'd to extend, by Colonies,
the Empire of their whole Nation,
and thereby the Possession and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of every particular Man in it.
Nor do we ever read, that the Irish
had any Wars with Strangers,
whereby they might have either
wanted Men to send into Foreign
Colonies, or have been forc'd to
keep them at home, for their own
defence. Whether then are our
Histories more probable, which
make this Colony to have come
over before <hi>Iulius Caesar?</hi> or the
Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s account, who
makes us not to have settl'd here,
till 503 Years after Christ. And
tho I esteem the Irish, yet I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that our humour differs so
much from theirs, that it may from
thence appear, that we stay'd not
long amongst them, but that we
came from thence very early.</p>
            <p>2. By all the tract of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Histories, as well as by <hi>Beda</hi>'s, <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s
and ours, it is clear, that the
Scots and Picts fought joyntly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59981:63"/>
the Romans in this Country
which we now possess: That the
Walls built by <hi>Adrian,</hi> and <hi>Severus,</hi>
were built here, to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them: That Complaints were
made to the <hi>Romans</hi> by the <hi>Britons</hi>
of them, and that Succours were
crav'd against them: That the
<hi>Saxons</hi> were call'd in, to defend the
<hi>Britons,</hi> from the Scotish and Pictish
Incursions: That they were call'd
jointly, <hi>unconquer'd Nations.</hi> All which
points prove, that they were equal in
every thing; and why not then in
their being equally settl'd here?
And therefore, except it were clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prov'd that the Scots were not
settl'd and fix'd here, as the Picts
were; and that there were Authors
produc'd, who living in these Times,
declar'd, that in the Year 503, the
Scots were first call'd to defend the
Picts, as the <hi>Saxons</hi> are clearly prov'd
to have been call'd in, against the
Scots, and Picts, in the Year 449,
very near to the Year 503; which is
said by the Bishop to be our Entry:
It must be necessarily concluded,
that the Scots were here at the time,
wherein all these things are told of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59981:63"/>
them joyntly, with the <hi>Picts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Argument shall be, that
it's undeniable, that the <hi>Scots</hi> and
<hi>Picts</hi> were such constant and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Enemies, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
<hi>Britans,</hi> who then possest the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
part of this Isle, were forc'd
to build two Fences against them:
The first betwixt <hi>Tyne</hi> and <hi>Solloway,</hi>
which was call'd <hi>Adrian</hi>'s <hi>Wall:</hi> And
the second, by <hi>Severus,</hi> who having
enlarg'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest, built
a second, betwixt <hi>Forth</hi> and <hi>Clyde,</hi>
and called it by his own name. How
then can it be imagin'd, that the Scots
did not live on the other side of that
Wall? for if they had liv'd in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Wall had not been neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or useful, against them. This
common sense would declare
to a Stranger, upon first reading
the Story; and much more ought
it to be believ'd, if we consider, that
if the Scots came from <hi>Ireland,</hi> in
<hi>Corroughs,</hi> as the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
alledges, from <hi>Gildas;</hi> then they
might have landed upon the <hi>Britons</hi>
side of the Wall; nay, and which is
more, they could not conveniently
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59981:64"/>
have landed on the other side, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they had gone too far about,
and cross'd a very broad and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Sea.</p>
            <p>4. Tho People come once, or
twice, from a Foreign Nation, by
Sea, to rob and pillage, yet it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sense to think, that for many
hundreds of Years, the <hi>Irish</hi> would
have come over, to make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such powerful Enemies, and
return once a Year. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
clearly, that this was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
War, from before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s
Time, for above 600 Years: and in
those Ages, it is known, that there
were not very convenient means
fall'n upon, for transporting Men,
much lesse Armies; they having
only <hi>Corroughs,</hi> as the Bishop of
St. <hi>Asaph</hi> himself acknowledges:
And these are a miserable little
kind of shapeless Boats, made of
Leather, streatch upon Timber,
as we find them, and the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea,
describ'd by<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 352.</note> 
               <hi>Solinus,</hi> who liv'd

<hi>interfluit, undosum &amp; inquietum
toto in anno, nisi aestivis pauculis die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,

viminiis alviis, quos circumdant am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitu

these could transport an Army every
Year to fight against such power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Enemies as the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons?</hi>
And how they could carry
back in them the great Booty wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be fought for? especially
over such broken Seas, that are yet
terrible in the best Season, to the
best of our Boats, and the stoutest
of Seamen, is left to be considered
by Men judicious, or disinterested
in any measure: Especially, seeing
they behov'd to return in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-time,
for it's presum'd, they
fought all Summer; and even then,
they had not the chusing of their
own fair Weather, but had just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be afraid that they would
be chas'd away, as Robbers usually
are; and as the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
asserts they often-times were. But
as all this is absurd, and incredible,
according to the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s
Hypothesis; so it is most consistent
with ours; in which we assert, that
the Scots setled on the other side of
<hi>Clyde,</hi> from which they might come
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59981:65"/>
every Year; which agrees also well
with <hi>Beda</hi>'s saying, That the Scots
setled <hi>ad partem septentrionalem sinus
Acluith,</hi> or <hi>Dumbriton;</hi> a narrow
Sea, and call'd one part of the <hi>Mare

Circuits, as is clear by the 4 Chap.

of <hi>Forth</hi> is call'd <hi>Mare Scotiae,</hi> the
<hi>Sea of Scotland,</hi> and that is mention'd
as a Law in old observance; it must
be concluded, that this Country
where we live, was call'd <hi>Scotland,</hi>
long before the Year 1000, as Bishop
<hi>Vsher</hi> asserts. For since <hi>Tacitus</hi> and
<hi>Beda</hi> say, That we were inclos'd by
that Sea, and the Wall, as in an
Isle; it seems that this was call'd the
Sea of <hi>Scotland</hi> then, it being our
March at that time. Nor are these
Friths improperly call'd Seas, being
40 miles broad in some places. And
this also agrees with our being <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marini,</hi>
or on the other side of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59981:65"/>
Sea, (which are the words us'd in
the said Statute) but not out of the
Isle; and it is strange, that the <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths</hi>
should have setled in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Spain;</hi> the <hi>Ostrogoths</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
shortly after they had made their
inroads; and yet we should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
yearly for above 600 Years,
notwithstanding of the former diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> The Scots coming over to
this Isle, could not but know, that
the southern Parts of it were very
rich, and the People there very
cowardly, even to admiration; as
the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
from all their Historians: and
there was place enough for a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them in this Isle, or else how
could they have planted themselves
after, when the Picts became more
numerous; and both the Scots and
the Picts had good reason to expect
every Year new additions of Land:
and it is probable, that our Ances<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
being a Colony of a more sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Nation, strangers in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and but lately setled there, left
their confinement in the Irish Isle
as soon as they could, to inlarge
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59981:66"/>
their Victories and Possessions in this
larger one, which afforded greater
Glory. How then can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
that they would not have
setled a Colony here, which was far
less dangerous, and more noble
and advantageous, than to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
robbing for small Booty, to
the danger of their Lives? But that
they fought for Land, and not for
Booty, is very clear; not only from
the practice of others, but from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellicus,</hi>

            <p>5. How it is imaginable, that the
Picts (finding themselves in so great
danger from the Romans and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
the one very considerable for
their Valour, and the other for their
great Numbers) would not have
intreated the Scots to stay constantly
with them? for tho they had been
equal to their Enemies, when the
Scots and they were together, yet
they could not be but much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to them, when the Scots left
them once every Year.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59981:66"/>
6. If the Irish had constantly
sent in Auxiliaries to assist against
the Romans, it is not to be believ'd
but the Romans would have resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this Injury against the Kingdom
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which they never did,
except once,<note n="*" place="margin">Buchan. <hi>p.</hi> 128.</note> when the Irish gave

heard, that the Kings of <hi>Ireland</hi> had
been mention'd, both in the Roman,
English, and our Histories: for it is
not to be imagin'd, that so long,
and so great Wars could have been
carried on by the Subjects, without
the consent of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>7. If they never had been call'd
in by the Picts, to stay as a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
till the Saxons had beat the
Britons, who had lately call'd them
in to their Assistance: How is it
imaginable to think, that the Picts
would have call'd them in as Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries
at that time? having so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59981:67"/>
seen, how dangerous Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
might prove, especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
that the Scots had been
us'd many hundred Years to rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
as the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
would have us believe; and that
they were part of a numerous near
Nation, from whom they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
suddenly great Supply: or
that they would have not only
run this risque, but have divided

yet not have employ'd their Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

From which I raise two
Arguments; 1. How can
it be imagin'd, that if the
Scots had not setled in a
Colony till the 503, that
their King could have
been so famous, that in
about 280 Years time,
this small Colony, which
the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
represents to have been
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59981:68"/>
but <hi>pilfering barbarous Robbers,</hi> would
have become so famous, that <hi>Charles
the Great,</hi> then Emperor of all the
Western World, would have entred
into a League with them, especially
since they had not for 100 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their settlement, done any memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Action,<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 34, &amp; 38.</note> as the Bishop of St.
<hi>Asaph</hi> alledges? 2. If our Kings, and
Nation, had only then <hi>Dalrieda,</hi> or
the Kingdom of <hi>Argile,</hi> as the Bishop
contends, how could this Prince of
<hi>Argile</hi> (which is, after all improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but an Earldom) have been
worthy, not only of the Alliance of
the great Emperor of the West,
but to be able to send 4000 Men,
especially having such dangerous
Enemies at Home, and being himself
but a Stranger, newly entred into a
Foreign Island, and living in a small
part of the Isle, with the Picts, the
more powerful and ancient posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.
And that there were 4000 Men
sent by virtue of that League, is
clear, not only from <hi>Verimundus,</hi>
out of whose <hi>2d</hi> Book <hi>Chambers</hi> cites
the whole League;<note place="margin">

of the <hi>Douglassii,</hi> or <hi>Scoti,</hi> whom he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59981:68"/>

of that Alliance.</p>
            <p>9. How can it be conceiv'd, that
the Scots could in so short a time,
after their Settlement, have been able,
without any help, to extirpate the
Picts, who must be presum'd to have
been very strong, having been so
long setled in this Isle; and having
possest in effect all that we have now,

And it were very ridiculous to
think, that since these Matters of
Fact are true, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were
bloody Civil Wars betwixt the
Uncles and the Nephews; and that
all this hath been much debated in
posterior Parliaments, betwixt such
as were for the Crown, and such as
were for popular Elections; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever controverting the Truth of
the Matter of Fact; and long before
we could have any apprehension of
such a debate as this, and so that all
this was a meer fiction, calculated
for maintaining an Antiquity, which
was never controverted.</p>
            <p>It can as little be deny'd, that there
were Laws relating to the <hi>merchetae
mulierum;</hi> since many of our old
Charters relate to them, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
of them are incorporated
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59981:69"/>
in our Charters; and which
Styles are a part of our old and
Traditional Law: These <hi>merchetae
mulierum</hi> were thereafter abrogated
by King <hi>Malcom Canmor</hi>'s Laws,
many hundred Years before the start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Debate: And that there
were such Laws, is also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
not only by <hi>Baker,</hi> and
others within the Isle, but even by
<hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Ierome,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="*" place="margin">

these Laws were made by <hi>Evenus</hi> the

and so cannot but be believ'd,
since Laws are one of the probablest
Means imaginable,<note n="*" place="margin">

Tradition. By the Laws likewise
of <hi>Malcom</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> who reign'd in
the Year 1004. The Frith of <hi>Forth</hi>
is call'd <hi>Mare Scotiae,</hi> or the Sea of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> which demonstrates, that
before the Year 1000, our Country
was call'd <hi>Scotia,</hi> or <hi>Scotland:</hi> and
confirms and clears all that is said
out of <hi>Beda;</hi> and as this designati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Scotish Sea is look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there, as a thing very old and
acknowledg'd; so it is continu'd
in our Laws for many Ages, as is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59981:70"/>
evident by <hi>K. I. 2d,</hi> his Laws above-cited.</p>
            <p>I had resolved not to mention
the Bishop's Objections, against our
early Conversion: But I find it so
clear, that we were converted to
the Christian Faith before the Year
503, that there results this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Argument from it, to prove
that we were setled before that
time. For if we were a Christian
Nation converted here, before that
time; it follows necessarily, that we
were a Nation setled here before
that Time: Since a Nation is said no
where to be converted, but where
it is setled, albeit some Persons of that
Nation may be said to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
abroad. And that this part of
the Isle which we now inhabit,
and that people from which we are
descended, were Christians before
that time; seems to me very evident,
from the former testimony of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
who wrote in the end of the
second Century, to which I refer
my Reader: And tho <hi>Tertullian</hi>
liv'd a little before King <hi>Donald,</hi> yet
the Answer is apparent, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Nations were ordinarily converted
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59981:70"/>
before the Kings or Magistrates. And
it's indeed very probable that the
<hi>Christians</hi> who were persecuted in the
Southern Nations, would flee from
their Persecutors, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
And where could they seek
refuge so reasonably, as in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and amongst that People which
had never submitted to the Roman
Empire? And it being acknowledg'd
by the learn'd <hi>Vsher,</hi> and my Lord
St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> that <hi>Britain</hi> was converted
in the first Century; it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to think, that the Christians,
who had fled to this Isle, from the
persecution of the Romans, would
have very probably shelter'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
here, where the Romans had
no power: for though it be not
prov'd, that the Roman Persecution
reach'd to <hi>Britain</hi> so early; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they who fled so far from the
Persecution, would not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
very secure within the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the Persecutors, and would
have secured themselves by a few
more Miles from so dreaded a danger.
As also, it seems very improbable,
that since the Christian Religion
spread from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Britain</hi> in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59981:71"/>
less than 100 Years, that it would
have taken above 300 Years more,
to reach so few Miles, as are betwixt
the British part of the Isle, and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
It is also presumable that
the <hi>Druids</hi> having been so prepared
to receive Christianity, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Principles of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and
their <hi>severity of Life formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
which did not contradict,</hi>
but illuminate the Christian
Doctrine, they would have both
been easie to be converted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and ready to have converted
their former Disciples, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who admir'd them. I might here
cite many Authors; but I fix upon
<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 13.</note>
               <hi>Beda,</hi> who asserts positively, That
<hi>Palladius</hi> was sent in the <hi>8th</hi> Year of
<hi>Theodosius junior;</hi> that is to say, in
the 431 <hi>ad Scotos in Christum creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
by Pope <hi>Caelestine,</hi> as their first
Bishop: And that <hi>Beda</hi> wrote of us,
as the Scots, is formerly prov'd;
and this Mission of <hi>Palladius</hi> falling
in the Tract and Series of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ascrib'd by <hi>Beda</hi> to us only, it is
inconsistent with common Reason,
that the things before and after, and
the things related in the very Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59981:71"/>
should be only applicable to
us, and yet only this should not:
albeit our own and Foreign Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

who, because he made <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick

            <p>To this it is answer'd, That our

differs from <hi>Beda,</hi> the far more

But it is improbable to say,
that a Bishop was sent to those, which
were to be converted, seeing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
useth to be by Presbyters,

conversion of the Scots and Picts
by St. <hi>Ninian, Palladius,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumba,</hi>
to make our conversion to be
later than <hi>Tertullian</hi> made it, <hi>viz.</hi>
in the <hi>2d</hi> Century, must be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
of our fuller and sounder

and of our being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
to the Romish Church, and
Rites, which the Authors of those
Times considered as the only true
conversion. But to make this our
first conversion, were to contradict
<hi>Tertullian, Ierome,</hi> the learn'd <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
as well as all our Histores. And
the<note n="*" place="margin">Edit. Basil. 1624. 2d. Cent. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>Magdeburgian Centuriators</hi> do
positively agree with <hi>Baronius,</hi> and
our History, in this our Antiquity:
and so having for us the greatest
Ecclesiastick Antiquaries, both Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and Papist, we need not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
upon particular Authors:
these being the Standards of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
History to the Professors of
both Religions: and it is strange
after all this, that a Church-man
should so positively contradict, what
the Antiquaries of both Churches
have so positively asserted; tho if there
had been any thing, wherein they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59981:73"/>
could have contradicted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they would certainly have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Donald</hi> then was our first
Christian King, in <hi>Anno</hi> 203, and
<hi>Palladius</hi> our first Bishop, in <hi>Anno
431,</hi> seems most fully prov'd: for
these being Matters of Fact, may be
prov'd by Witnesses; and who are
better Witnesses, than the many
Historians of the Country where
the things were transacted; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since these were Matters of
great importance, and Notoriety;
which the Monasteries, whose Faith
is followed by our Historians, could
not but know best of all others,
and in which they durst not cheat
or forge, because the Annals of other
Churches would have contradicted
them, whereas they are confirm'd
by them; and these things fell out,
when we had the help of Letters,
and are agreeable to the sound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
above-related: Tho the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of a Kingdom be a matter
that could not be unknown, and
no other King but <hi>Donald</hi> was ever
recorded to have been the first
Christian King here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59981:73"/>
That <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent to the
Scots in <hi>Britain,</hi> and not to the Scots
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> appears further from these
undeniable matters of Fact; <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>Pope Caelestine</hi> did ordain, and
send <hi>Palladius,</hi> in Anno 431: That
the same <hi>Pope Caelestine</hi> sent <hi>St. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi>
to <hi>Ireland:</hi> That <hi>St. Patrick</hi>'s
Mission must have been before the
<hi>6th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 432, is also clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Prosper</hi> tells, that <hi>Caelestine</hi>
died that Year. And the <hi>Roman
Pontifical</hi> tells, it was on the <hi>6th</hi> of
<hi>April</hi> that Year. From all which,
the <hi>Bishop</hi> did see that <hi>Palladius</hi>'s
mission must have been to the <hi>Scots</hi>
in <hi>Scotland;</hi> else <hi>Palladius</hi> had been
first Bishop of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and St. <hi>Patrick</hi>
needed not have been sent into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
since <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent there but
the Year before. To reconcile which
real Contradictions, the Bp of St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph</hi>
makes up a laborious <hi>Hypothesis,</hi>
and say's, that <hi>Palladius</hi> was indeed
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but finding he could not
succeed, he was upon his return to
<hi>Rome,</hi> but died in, or near the
bounds of the <hi>Picts,</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,
431.</hi> So that St. <hi>Patrick,</hi>
who liv'd in <hi>Britain,</hi> could not but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59981:74"/>
have known his death, and had
time enough to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
be ordain'd Bishop for <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and go to that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and there
finish their Conversion, which
<hi>Palladius</hi> had only begun: and so
St. <hi>Patrick</hi> was call'd the first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
All this Hypothesis is almost
impossible, though good <hi>Palladius</hi>
had sooner, and deeplier despair'd,
than a Saint should have done, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the Conversion of a whole
Nation: and though both had post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
faster for a Benefice, than Holy-Church-men
did in those Primitive
Times. Yet all this is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Palladius</hi>'s having died <hi>Decemb.</hi>
15. 431. And the only proofs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
for this by my Lord St. <hi>Asaph,</hi>
is <hi>Baleus de 14. scrip.</hi> 6. near the end;
and yet in that same Citation it is
positively said, that <hi>Palladius</hi> was
sent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the particular
Scotish King is nam'd; and <hi>Baleus</hi>
adds, That <hi>Palladius claruit Anno vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginei
partus, 434; he flourish'd in the
Year</hi> 434, and so he died not in the
431. And not content with this, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi>
goes on, telling, that <hi>post multos
pios tandem sudores &amp; religiosa exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citia
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59981:74"/>
in</hi> Fordono <hi>vico</hi> Merniae <hi>foeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem
hujus vitae sortius est exitum.</hi>
Which is in our <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in
the North part thereof, very far
out of the Road from <hi>Ireland</hi> to
<hi>Rome;</hi> and where we have St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Church</hi> and <hi>Fair;</hi> and with us
he is nam'd our first Bishop to this
day: but was never nam'd an Irish
Bishop, until the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
made him by a strange word first, <hi>in
omination of success,</hi> as he says, tho not
he, but St. <hi>Patrick</hi> had this success. If
then he died not so soon, and if the
time of his death is not prov'd, why
might he not have baptiz'd <hi>Tarvanus?</hi>
And why should our <hi>Boethius</hi> be
hector'd for saying, that <hi>Palladius</hi>
baptiz'd <hi>Tarvan?</hi> Yet I impute not
this to my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s mistake or
ignorance; but it is an elaborate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
to divert all the unanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Authorities, proving that <hi>Palladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
was sent to us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the
Year 431, and so before the Year 503;
in which my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi> says we
setled first in <hi>Britain.</hi> I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this concerning <hi>Palladius,</hi> with
the suffrage of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> a
learn'd and Episcopal English Divine,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59981:75"/>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 162.</note>who in his <hi>vindication of the disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
concerning Episcopacy,</hi> recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
the seeming Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Beda,</hi> who asserts, that <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
was sent to the Scots believing in
Christ:</hi> And <hi>Prosper,</hi> who speaking
of the same Mission, says, That <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius
made also the Barbarous Island
Christian;</hi> lays down these three
Conclusions; 1. That Christianity
was planted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> before <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi>'s
Time, deriv'd to them most
probably from their Neighbour <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
here, with whom they are known
to have agreed in the keeping of
<hi>Easter,</hi> contrary to the Custom of
the Roman Church, as<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Beda</hi> says.
2. That this Plantation was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
differing little from Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism,
and so reputed by <hi>Prosper,</hi> till
the coming of Bishop <hi>Palladius</hi> among
them. 3. That even after that, they
retain'd the use of <hi>Easter,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>Roman</hi> custome, which
still refers to some rude conversion
of theirs before <hi>Palladius;</hi> and so it
is evident, that in the learn'd <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>'s
opinion, the <hi>Scotland</hi> to which
<hi>Palladius</hi> was sent, was ours; and
that we were <hi>Christians</hi> before his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59981:75"/>
coming, tho rude and barbarous.
The Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> having thus
spirited from us, into <hi>Ireland, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius</hi>
our first Bishop, he proceeds
to translate <hi>Amphibalus</hi> our first
Churchman upon Record, unto a
Shag-Cloak; designing likewise
thereby to prove, that <hi>Boethius</hi> our
Historian is not to be credited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he follow'd their fabulous <hi>Ief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey:</hi>
Who finding that St. <hi>Alban</hi>
had, to save his pious Guest, taken
the holy Man's Habit, to the end he
might be martyr'd for him; and as
<hi>Beda</hi> expresses it, <hi>Caracalla ejus indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;
Ieffrey</hi> concludes, as my Lord
St. <hi>Asaph</hi> alledges, that the Vestiment
was <hi>Amphibalus;</hi> and <hi>Ieffrey</hi> having
made the Cloak a Man, <hi>Boetius</hi> made
him a Bishop of the <hi>Isle of Man:</hi> and
so this Cloak was fitly ordain'd to be
a proper Bishop for the Chapter of
the <hi>Culdees:</hi> But this is <hi>ludere in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris,</hi>
and to expose Episcopacy it self
upon the Stage. In answer to which,
I shall only offer these few thoughts,
First, What Interest had <hi>Ieffrey</hi>
(who was a <hi>Briton</hi>) to oblige the
Scots, or the <hi>Isle of Man,</hi> in making
so horrid a lye? 2. It is against sense,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59981:76"/>
to think that any Man, much less a
Scholar, could have been so gross,
as to take a Shag Cloak for a Bishop.
3. If the Shag Cloak had been mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the name of a Man, he should
have been call'd <hi>Caracalla,</hi> and not
<hi>Amphibalus;</hi> for the <hi>Legend</hi> being
written in Latin, <hi>Ieffrey</hi> had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chosen the word <hi>Caracalla,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that was the Latin word, and
was the word used by <hi>Beda,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was a Roman Emperor
truly of that name, before <hi>Beda</hi> and
<hi>Ieffrey</hi>'s Time. 4. <hi>Beda</hi> relating to
that passage, tells us, that in the <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian</hi>
Persecution, St. <hi>Alban, Aron,
Iulius,</hi> and many others suffer'd:
And why might not <hi>Amphibalus</hi> be
one of these many that suffer'd? And
why ought <hi>Boethius</hi> to have been
tax'd, for mentioning <hi>Amphibalus,</hi>
since this was done long before him,
by a multitude of English Writers,
cited by Bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> who deriv'd
his birth from <hi>Greece,</hi> and describes
the particular Actions of his Life,
and his Martyrdom; with which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the modern English Writers agree,
as<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 28, &amp; 58.</note> 
               <hi>Baleus, Holinshed, Speed,</hi> all
which English, and thousands of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59981:76"/>
other Testimonies do far weigh
down Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi>'s Conjectures,
that <hi>Amphibalus</hi> was not a Man, but
a Vestiment, from the silence of
<hi>Gildas, Beda,</hi> the Martyrologies
and Breviaries of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and
<hi>Ieffrey,</hi> who do not mention him:
for <hi>Gildas</hi> could not mention him,
writing concerning the Conquest,
and Destruction of <hi>Britain; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
tells the Passage relative to St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban;</hi>
and albeit he names him not
in the Dioclesian Persecution, yet he
tells, that many more suffer'd than
the three he names. We have not
seen the Martyrologies, and Brevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
nor does it import whether
they mention him or not; and it is
not so much to be wondered at, that
some English Writers do not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
him, as that he is mention'd by
so many, seeing he was a <hi>Greek,</hi> and
a Bishop in the remote Isles of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and in all likelihood would
have been buried under silence, had
it not been for that Passage with
St. <hi>Alban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My last Argument for confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our History, shall be, that the
best Critiques, Historians, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59981:77"/>
of other Nations, who had
occasion to mention our Histories,
and particularly the great <hi>Baronius,
Scaliger, Salmasius, Lipsius, Carolus
Sigonius, Favinus, Selden,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the first Rank, (too many
to be nam'd) have passionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
our Antiquity, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sustain'd, but prais'd our Histories:
and so the Arguments and Grounds
whereupon I have proceeded, are
already asserted by the best Judges,
and that too after <hi>Luddus</hi> publish'd
his Objections against the same, and
almost the very same Objections
which are now urg'd, and which
are treated with great contempt by
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seb.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Scaliger.</hi> Since then there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
now urg'd, that could have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the observation of these learn'd
and curious Authors, who could not
but have discover'd, as soon as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> that our Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
did not mention any Warrants
which were written in the Time, or
did contradict the Roman History or
one another. I admire why now these
our Histories should be controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And tho something might be
pretended, if my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi> did
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59981:77"/>
in this Book, produce Manuscripts
unknown to those learn'd Criticks;
yet could they have been so blind
and ignorant (especially in that
subtile and laborious Age, wherein
all Men were by a noble emulation
contending, who should discover
most) as not to have seen defects?
which if they had been real, they
had been obvious. It is also very
remarkable, that since all Nations
are emulous of one another in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Antiquity; yet they, by
yielding to ours, have thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
that ours was beyond
all debate; and to this day, none
controvert it, (notwithstanding of
all the pains taken by <hi>Luddus, Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and <hi>Vsher</hi>) further than to
gratify their own Country. And
therefore, as <hi>Cicero</hi> argues, that the
Romans were the bravest, because
every Nation commended them next
to their own: I may contend, that
we are the most ancient, because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nation confesses us to be next
to themselves in Antiquity. I shall
cite, for confirming this, some few
Instances. <hi>Saxo Gram. Swaningius,
Albertus Krantzius,</hi> own our Name
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59981:78"/>
and Nation to have been before
Christ, though after the <hi>Danes. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeray</hi>
shortly after <hi>Pharamond:</hi> and
my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi> himself, who
brings us in but 50 Years after the
English.</p>
            <p>Since it is probable that the Bishop
of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> and I will not agree well
in the decision of this Debate; were
it not just that we should both rest
in the decision of learn'd Strangers,
who understood Antiquities exactly,
these being the subject Matter of
our Controversy? And where can
we find more qualified Judges than
those great Antiquaries whom I have
named? But yet to shew how much
I trust to the strength of that Truth
which I assert, I dare appeal to <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
that English-man, who was so
affectionate to his Country, and that
Antiquary who understood best of
all Mankind the Antiquities of his
own Nation, and even to him also in
his <hi>Mare Clausum,</hi> written for the
Defence and Glory of his Country;
who, <hi>lib. 2. cap. 8. Maris Clausi,</hi> has
these words, speaking of those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Lines in <hi>Claudian,</hi> to the praise
of <hi>Stilicho,</hi>
               <q>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:59981:78"/>
                  <l>Inde <hi>Caledonio</hi> velata <hi>Britannia</hi> monstro</l>
                  <l>‚ÄîTotam cum <hi>Scotus Jernam</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Movit &amp; infesto spumavit remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge Tethys.</l>
               </q>
               <q>As the <hi>Palmes,</hi> and the River <hi>Tagus</hi>
were peculiar to <hi>Spain,</hi> as the Ears
of Corn and Ivory to <hi>Africa;</hi> so
he would have it understood, that
the Province of <hi>Britain</hi> had the Sea
of the same name peculiar there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
But yet it is to be conceiv'd,
that the Dominion of the Romans
was so limited in this Sea, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their possession of the Shore,
that they had little power in that
part of the British Sea, which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
upon the Shores of those Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Nations who were not under
their Obedience. This is to be
taken chiefly of the Irish Sea, and
the rest that lies North-west; for
when the Roman Empire began to
decline, not only in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
in the <hi>Isle of Man</hi> also, and the
other Isles of the Western Sea, and
a great portion of the more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
parts of <hi>Britain</hi> was possess'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59981:79"/>
by the Scots and Picts, so that we
have sufficient ground to conceive,
that they also had an ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of their own in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Sea.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From which Passage I argue thus,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Selden</hi> consider'd the Scots
and Picts, as Nations not subject to
the Romans; <hi>Gentes iis (viz. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis)
minime subjacentes, No manner
of way subject to the Romans;</hi> and
looks on us as the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of these two Nations: for the
words run, <hi>A Scotis, tenebatur Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctisque;</hi>
and very justly, for we
were able to defend them while
they were just to us, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
them when they became
Enemies.</p>
            <p>2. This great Antiquary asserts,
that the Scots and Picts possest not
only in <hi>Stilicho</hi>'s Time, who was
Guardian to <hi>Honorius,</hi> and so liv'd
about <hi>Anno</hi> 400, a great portion
of the Northern part of <hi>Britain,</hi> as
well as the Isle of <hi>Man,</hi> and the rest
of the Western Isles; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
if we possest them then, it
cannot be said that we were only
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59981:79"/>
here by way of incursion, till the
Year 500; or were confin'd to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile,</hi>
till after the Year 500, as my
Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi> contends.</p>
            <p>3. That we were not only possest
then, but that we had <hi>avitum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium,
ancient Dominion,</hi> and had
right <hi>prisco jure;</hi> and nothing is so
inconsistent with the being Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as to be Robbers, coming only
by way of Incursion; and if we
had the Dominion of our Seas, <hi>jure
prisco,</hi> and <hi>per Dominium avitum;</hi>
we were certainly ancient Possessors
before the Year 400, and so must
have been not only far older than
the Year 500, but even to have been
<hi>prisci incolae,</hi> as <hi>Beda (l. 1. c. 1.)</hi> says,
before the Romans entred this Isle,
and so before Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Selden</hi> also, in the transition from
that <hi>2d</hi> to the <hi>3d</hi> Chapter, tells, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he had spoke of the Scots
Dominion of their own Sea, that he
will treat of the succeeding Ages, and
so proceeds to the Saxons, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates,
that we were setled here
before the Saxons, though my Lord
St. <hi>Asaph</hi> makes their settlement here
more ancient than ours. And in this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59981:80"/>
               <hi>Beda</hi> agrees with <hi>Selden,</hi> but both
contradict the Bishop. And lastly, this
passage clears, that the Testimonies, not
only of <hi>Claudian</hi> concerning <hi>Ierna,</hi>
but even of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> when speaking
of the Inhabitants of <hi>Britain</hi> not
conquer'd by the Romans, and of
<hi>Ierom</hi> speaking of the Britannick
Nations, are only applicable to us:
And therefore I hope my Lord St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph</hi>
will not take it ill, if we, in a
Matter of Antiquity, prefer an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Antiquary, to an interested
Divine, as I would not be offended,
if the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to me in a Theological Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.</p>
            <p>The first general Objection against
our Histories,<note place="margin">SECT. 7.</note> is,<note place="margin">Answers to the Bishop's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</note> that they were not
written by those who lived in the
Time, but more than 1400 Years after
the things happened, of which they
wrote. And it were strange, that if
<hi>Gild<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> who liv'd 500 Years before
the eldest of them, could find no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Instructions, save from Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
that our Historians should
have found sufficient Warrants for
a History after so long a time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59981:80"/>
To which my Answer is, That our
Histories giving only an account of
one Nation, it was easier to find the
true and sincere Tradition as to us,
than it was in other Nations, where
the Conquerors were not concern'd
to preserve the Traditions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords:
and though I have made it
very probable, that this Isle had the
use of Letters before, or at least soon
after we settl'd in it, and so might
have preserv'd the Story. Yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
our History were only found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on Tradition, until about 600
Years after Christ, before which the
Monastery of <hi>Iona</hi> or <hi>Icolm-kill</hi> was
founded, that Tradition might have
been sufficiently preserv'd, for so few
Generations, by the means and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
that I have formerly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
upon. Nor can I see, how
the Origin of a Nation could not
have been preserv'd by those who
were of it, or how, being establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it could have vanished when
People became more polite and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
And after the Year 600, I have
prov'd, that our Historians might
have been, and were sufficiently
warranted in what they have said,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59981:81"/>
by old Manuscripts, and Records:
nor is there any thing urg'd in this
Objection against us, but what might
as unanswerably be urg'd against
the Greek and Latin Historians. A
receiv'd History cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
from what I have formerly
represented, without Arguments,
which necessarily conclude that the
History impugn'd must be false;
which cannot be alledg'd here, where
the Warrants of the History contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
not only might have been, but
probably were true; and are
so far from contradicting other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
that they are confirm'd by
them.</p>
            <p>I desire also to know, what old
Manuscripts and Records <hi>Luddus,</hi>
the Antiquary so far preferr'd to ours,
had for proving, that much elder
Succession of History from <hi>Brutus</hi>
to his own Time: And whereas St.
<hi>Asaph</hi> says, that <hi>Buchannan</hi> should
not have tax'd <hi>Luddus</hi> for deriving
the <hi>Britons</hi> from <hi>Brutus,</hi> since he
own'd a Succession of our Kings
from <hi>Fergus,</hi> there being as few Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments
to support the one, as the
other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59981:81"/>
To this my Answer is, That
there have been very solid grounds
brought for sustaining the one, which
cannot be alledg'd for the other:
and ours are adminiculated by the
Roman History, whereas theirs is
inconsistent with it: for it is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably
inconsistent with the Roman
History, to say, that <hi>Brutus</hi> was the
Son of <hi>Ascanius</hi> whom he kill'd, for
which being banish'd from <hi>Italy,</hi> he
came over to <hi>Britain:</hi> and that <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
was govern'd by Consuls: which
should rather be laugh'd at, than
confuted.</p>
            <p>The Bishop is most unjust to us, in
asserting, that we have no Author
of our own before <hi>Fordon;</hi> and
that no Author mentions our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
but such as have follow'd
<hi>Fordon,</hi> who wrote about 300 Years
ago. For <hi>Fordon</hi> cites his Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
many of which are extant, and
those who are lost, are prov'd to have
been extant. Within the Isle we
could have no Authors till there
were Writers, and <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi>
the eldest in the Isle, prove our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.
Without the Isle none could
know us, being so remote, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59981:82"/>
by the Wars they had with us,
or the Christianity that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them and us. As to our
Wars, all the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors above-related
speak of us; <hi>Orosius</hi> about
the Year 417. <hi>Claudian 397. Ammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
before the Year 360. <hi>Beda</hi> and
<hi>Eumenius</hi> speak of us, as before <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caesar,</hi> as hath been prov'd. All
which we have collaterally suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by a gradation of Ecclesiastick
Historians abroad, and all our own
Historians at home. <hi>Beda</hi> brings us
to <hi>Reutherus,</hi> who was the <hi>6th</hi> King
from <hi>Fergus</hi> the first: and he living
within 150 Years of <hi>Fergus,</hi> this short
step may be trusted to Tradition,
though we had wanted the help
of the <hi>Druids,</hi> and <hi>Phaenician</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
for a Father might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
his Son of so near a Time; nor
was this worthy of a fiction. And
I may modestly say of the foregoing
Citations from forraign Authors,
that if they be not strong enough to
overturn the Bishop's Hypothesis, yet
they are at least as strong as those
produc'd by <hi>Iosephus</hi> in defence of
the Jewish History; and yet all the
learn'd World has acquiesc'd in them.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59981:82"/>
Nor is there any thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the silence of <hi>Adamna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and <hi>Marianus,</hi> the eldest of our
Historians: though, as the Bishop
alleadges, they had certainly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
our Antiquitiy, if they had
known it. For <hi>Adamnanus</hi> wrote
no History save of <hi>Columba;</hi> and
<hi>Marianus</hi> going to <hi>Germany,</hi> when he
was very young, could know little
of us, and mentions only the three
Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in whose time
he liv'd: and so if this Argument
prov'd any thing, it would prove
too much. For certainly we had
Kings before those three, whom he
mentions; and these negative
Arguments are of no moment in
Matters of History, and are justly
reprobated by the learned <hi>Scaliger,</hi>
in his Notes on <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and by<note n="*" place="margin">De Hist. La<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>. p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Objection is, That
our Historians contradict one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concerning the Origin of the
Picts; which ought to lessen their
credit. But to this it is answered,
That our Historians were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to consider the Origin of the
Picts as they were to consider their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59981:83"/>
own. And this Objection subsumes
not what is true in Matter of Fact.
For our Historians generally agree
in the Origin of the Picts, whom
all of them make to be <hi>Scythians:</hi>
and though <hi>Fordon</hi> relates three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
accounts of them, yet he does
not settle upon any thing that is
different from our other Historians
<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 30, &amp; 37. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> 1.</note>as is fully to be seen.</p>
            <p>The third Objection is, That our
Historians are contradicted by our
own Antecessors; for our Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
assert that King <hi>Donald</hi> the first
was our first Christian King; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in our Apology against <hi>Edward</hi>
the first of England, about the Year
1300, we assert the Tradition of a
wonderful Victory obtain'd by our
King <hi>Hungus,</hi> against the <hi>Saxons,</hi>
by the Relicts of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> the
Apostle, by virtue whereof the Scots
first receiv'd the Faith of Christ.</p>
            <p>To which it is shortly answer'd,
that every Contradiction does not
overturn the Truth of a whole Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
otherwise we need not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to give any other answer to
the Bishop's own Book: nor is this
pretended to be a Contradiction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59981:83"/>
our Historians, for they all
agree, that King <hi>Donald</hi> was our first
Christian King; but in that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
which is alledg'd to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
our Histories, our Predecessors
design'd, as most Pleaders do (and
this Eloquent Author does in his
Book) to gain their Point at any
rate. For understanding whereof,
it is fit to know, that King <hi>Edward</hi>
the first, having upon the Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
betwixt <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Baliol,</hi>
interpos'd with design to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Lord Paramount of <hi>Scotland;</hi> he
caus'd his Parliament write to the
Pope, to whom afterwards he wrote
himself; in which Letter of his, it
is pretended, that we were Vassals
to <hi>England,</hi> as descended from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banactus</hi>
the second Son to <hi>Brutus.</hi>
2. Because several of our Kings had
become Vassals to his Predecessors,
in the Times of the British, Saxon,
and Norman Kings. To which we
answer in our Apology, That without
debating, whether the first Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Isle were descended from
<hi>Albanactus,</hi> or his <hi>Albanians,</hi> it
is asserted, that we came from
<hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Ireland,</hi> and conquer'd
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59981:84"/>
the first Inhabitans (for which
we cite<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bed.</hi> Ec. Hist. lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Beda</hi>) and so, tho
they had been Vassals, we were
free; not being lyable to the
Conditions of the People we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd;
and as such, fought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
against the <hi>Britons,</hi> who
were forc'd to build <hi>Severus</hi>'s Wall
against us. And as to any homage
made by our Kings, it was either
for the Three Northen Countries of
<hi>Cumberland, Westmoreland,</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
confirm'd to us by the
<hi>Britons,</hi> to defend them against the
<hi>Saxons;</hi> and thereafter again<note n="*" place="margin">St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> p. 45.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by both <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Britons</hi>
to assist them against the <hi>Danes.</hi> Or
was extorted by force, from one or
two young Captive Kings; upon
which heads the Popes had declar'd
us free: which Bulls, <hi>Edward</hi> himself
had robb'd unjustly out of our
Treasure, with other Records, which
he could not deny: but to cajole
the Pope their Judg, they insinuate,
that though they were not Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to his Holiness, as <hi>England</hi> was;
yet they ought to be protected by
the Pope, because they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by St. <hi>Andrew</hi> his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59981:84"/>
Brother-german: St. <hi>Andrew</hi>
having in <hi>Hungus</hi>'s reign obtain'd for
them a Victory over the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and
so became subject, and subservient
to the Pope, in having converted the
<hi>Saxons</hi> by <hi>Aidan, Finan,</hi> and <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
From this Matter of Fact, I
observe, 1. That we own'd the
same origination there, that our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
do to this day: and so our
Ancestors differ'd not from our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
much less are they irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable,
as St. <hi>Asaph</hi> alleadges. 2.
That the English acknowledg'd us
to be as ancient as the <hi>Britons,</hi> they
and we being descended from two
Brothers. 3. That what we said of
St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> must needs be upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
to have oblidg'd the Pope, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certainly, either that we were
then first effectually converted to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the Oriental
Observations, in which we were
very long very obstinate, and that
<hi>Rome</hi> consider'd that, as the true
Conversion; or that after that time
we first became subject, tho not
feudatary to the Pope, as these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
words subjoyn'd do insinuate.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59981:85"/>
But that our conversion from <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi>
was more than 400 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> is positively assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that same Apology. Nor can
this have another meaning, for it is
undeniable, that we were Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
long before the reign of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
who reign'd 800 Years after
Christ: and <hi>Colman,</hi> &amp;c. liv'd long
before that King. Nor was <hi>Hungus</hi>
our King, we being only Auxiliaries
to him then, as King of the Picts:
after which Apology, King <hi>Robert</hi>
the <hi>1st</hi> being crown'd, and having
defeated King <hi>Edward</hi> at <hi>Banock-burn,</hi>
where he gain'd a most signal Victory
over the <hi>English,</hi> they then being
low, made application to the Pope;
and he having discharg'd us, by a
formal Interdiction, to pursue the
Victory into <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Nobility,</hi>
to pacify that Pope, and to remove
the Interdiction, at the desire of
the King, wrote Letter, wherein
they own the Antiquity of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Religion, and <hi>Royal-Line,</hi>
mentioning when we came from
<hi>Spain,</hi> as our Historians do, with
whom they agree exactly, <hi>Vt ex an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquorum
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59981:85"/>
gestis, &amp; libris, collegimus,</hi>
says the Letter: which being prior
to <hi>Fordon,</hi> proves that all this was not
<hi>Fordon</hi>'s Dream, and that our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is well founded on old Records,
prior to <hi>Fordon.</hi> And lastly, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that our Kings were not Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
to <hi>England</hi> for their Crown, but
only for these Provinces, as<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 46.</note> my Lord
St. <hi>Asaph</hi> confesses, and as I have
prov'd in my <hi>Treatise of Precedency;</hi>
albeit our Independency was as much
controverted of old, as our Antiquity
is now: and I hope that the one will
shortly appear as unjust a Pretence, as
the other is already confest to be.
From this it appears, that there is
rather a Harmony than real Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
here, and that any seeming
Contradiction is far less, than the real
ones, betwixt <hi>Beda,</hi> and the Bishop
of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> and the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
wherein he differs
from himself. For clearing whereof,
observe, That the Bishop says<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
not the truth of any thing that
is said to have been within 800, nay
within 1400 Years; but so it is,
that this would bring us to be setled
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59981:86"/>
here, before the Year 300 after
Christ: for substract 1400 out of
1684, (which is the Year in which
the Bishop prints his Book) his
Lordship can controvert nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
what was done within 284
Years after Christ: And yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes
our Historians, for saying, that
we were settl'd here before the Year
503; and denies our being Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
for many Years after the Year
300; and to improve this learn'd
Bishop's just Concession, I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that all our Historians agree,
that <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>great King</hi> of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> who died <hi>Anno,</hi> 892, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Northumberland</hi> to the <hi>Merse;</hi>
and having defeated the <hi>Britons</hi> at
<hi>Lochmaben,</hi> he forc'd them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
their ancient League, and to
confirm to him the former Right,
his Predecessors got from them to
<hi>Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Westmorland,</hi> for
assisting them against the Picts and
Saxons; which shews also, what great
things we could do, not only alone
without, but even against the Picts.
All which being said by our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
not only within the 1400
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59981:86"/>
Years, but the 800, are not contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible
by the Bishop's concession:
and therefore I understand not why
he asserts<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 42.</note> that we had nothing but
the Kingdom of <hi>Argyle</hi> before the
beating and extirpating of the <hi>Picts,</hi>
who gave us their possession beyond
<hi>Drumalbain.</hi> Nor can I reconcile,
how the Bishop asserts all alongst,
and particularly,<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 1. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph 2, 3, and 12.</note> that the <hi>Picts</hi>
had nothing besouth <hi>Grahams-dyke,</hi>
or the <hi>Frith</hi> of <hi>Forth</hi> and <hi>Clyde:</hi> and
yet he confesses<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 156.</note> that amongst the
<hi>South-Picts,</hi> there was a Monastery
of St. <hi>Martin</hi> at <hi>Whit-horn</hi> founded
by St. <hi>Ninian,</hi> in honour of that
Saint; and <hi>Whit-horn</hi> is in <hi>Galloway,</hi>
in the furthest south point of our
<hi>Scotland,</hi> near eighty miles besouth
<hi>Forth;</hi> and himself also confesses<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 83.</note>
               <hi>Whit-horn</hi> to be in <hi>Galloway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Objection being, that
our Historians have followed <hi>Ieffrey</hi>
of <hi>Monmoth,</hi> in many rediculous
inventions, which were purely his
own; and particularly in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of <hi>Bassianus,</hi> who being <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi>
is by him pretended to have
been kill'd in <hi>Britain,</hi> by <hi>Fulgenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59981:87"/>
which, tho <hi>Buchannan</hi> does not
exactly follow, yet he still makes
<hi>Bassianus</hi> to have been <hi>a Roman
Lieutenant,</hi> and to have been kill'd
in <hi>Britain;</hi> whereas it appears
not from any Roman Authors, that
there was any Roman Lieutenant
here. To this it is answered, That
no Man comparing our Histories
with <hi>Ieffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> can think
so: for we bring not our Nation
from <hi>Brutus,</hi> as he does against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense; and tho <hi>Ieffrey</hi> tells a
story of <hi>Bassianus</hi> the Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kill'd in <hi>Britain,</hi> which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
the Roman Story; yet <hi>Fordon</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>But the great Objection used by
the Bishop, against our Antiquity,
lyes in the 4th ¬ß of the Bishop's first
Chapter, wherein he asserts,</hi> That
<hi>Ireland</hi> was peopled by the Scots, and
was the only <hi>Scotland</hi> before these
times, viz. <hi>before the Year 503:
And in the 5th ¬ß,</hi> That there were no
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59981:88"/>
               <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> before the said Year
300. <hi>And in the</hi> 6th <hi>and</hi> 8th ¬ß;
That the <hi>Scots,</hi> betwixt the 300 and
500 Years, were indeed here, but not
setled, and only by way of Incursion.
<hi>And in the</hi> 9th ¬ß, <hi>he asserts,</hi> That
about the Year 500 they first setled
here, and erected the Kingdom of
<hi>Argile. And in the</hi> 12th <hi>and</hi> 13th
¬ß, <hi>he asserts,</hi> That after the Year
900, we got the rest of the Country,
and then only it came to be called <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For clearing all these Mistakes,
without partiality or humour, I
shall sum up my Answers in these
distinct Propositions.</p>
            <p>First, It is undeniable in it self,
and acknowledged by our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
that the first special Names,
under which <hi>Ireland</hi> was known,
were <hi>Ierna</hi> among the<note n="*" place="margin">Ptolom. Geog. <hi>lib. 2. cap.</hi> 2.</note> Greeks, and
<hi>Hibernia</hi> among the Latins: both
of which are, as I said, acknowledg'd
by<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">
                  <hi>P. 722, 723, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 724. Hanc insulam <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidem</hi> olim √† <hi>Julio Caesare</hi> vocatam <hi>Fabius Ethelwardus</hi> haud recte retulit: non alio enim quam <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berniae</hi> nomine, √† <hi>Caesare,</hi> uti post eum √† <hi>Plinio, Solino,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tacito</hi> illam invenimus.</note> Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59981:88"/>
My second Position is, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Year 300, there is no Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Author produced by either
Nation, that mentions <hi>Scotia, Scoti,</hi>
or <hi>Scoticae gentes,</hi> except <hi>Seneca,</hi> who
mentions the <hi>Scoto-brigantes:</hi> and
<hi>Florus</hi> the <hi>Scoticae pruinae:</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisippus,</hi>
who mentions <hi>Scotia:</hi> and
<hi>Porphyrie,</hi> who mentions <hi>Scoticae gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>
And tho I have prov'd former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all these Authors and Passages to
be genuine, and applicable to us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
yet, <hi>tho they were only spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Authors, or the conjectural Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of new Criticks,</hi> as Bishop<note n="*" place="margin">P. 725, 726, 727, 728.</note> 
               <hi>Vsher</hi>
(whom my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi> follows)
alledges,<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Cap. 1. ¬ß. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Porphyrie</hi> only excepted,
whose Testimony is admitted by him
to be in the third Century. It clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows, that my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
has, without sufficient Warrant, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
in the forementioned place,
that <hi>Ireland</hi> was called <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Year 300: he admitting no
Author for this, save <hi>Porphyrie,</hi>
whose Book he acknowledges not
to be extant, but to be only cited
by <hi>Ierom,</hi> who liv'd long after the
Year 300.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59981:89"/>
3. My chief Design in this Book,
is not to debate the Antiquity of the
Names of <hi>Scotia,</hi> or <hi>Scoti,</hi> but only
when we first setled under Kings in
this Isle. And consequently though
Arch-bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> and the Bishop of
St. <hi>Asaph</hi> could prove, that the
words <hi>Scotia,</hi> and <hi>Scoti,</hi> were not
known the first 300 Years, except
in <hi>Porphyrie;</hi> yet that cannot prove
that we were not setled here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Time. For it is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that many Nations have had
peculiar Names, before those Names
can be found in History, as <hi>Scaliger</hi>
very well proves: and they could
not be known in Histories, till other
Nations had commerce with them,
and wrote of them, which was a thing
very accidental. And Foreigners
do oft-times design Nations by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatives,
which they themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
And it is asserted by Bp <hi>Vsher,</hi>
that the Scots inhabited <hi>Ireland</hi> long
before the Year 300, tho till then
he cannot give an Author for that
word. And who can deny that the
Picts liv'd long here before <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59981:89"/>
who first mention'd them, and
liv'd long after <hi>Porphyrie</hi> who men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the Scots? And it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
that to this day, neither the
Irish nor we are call'd Scots in the
true Irish Language; for they call
their own Country-men <hi>Erenach,</hi>
from the word <hi>Ierna,</hi> or <hi>Ibernia,</hi> and
us <hi>Albanach,</hi> from <hi>Albion,</hi> and <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi>
Which also clears, that we got
that name long before <hi>Iulius Caesar's</hi>
Time; since before that time, the
word <hi>Albian</hi> was run into desue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and was succeeded to by the
more known name of <hi>Britannia:</hi>
And these Originations are the more
confirm'd, that to this day the same
Irish, and our Highlanders, know
no other names to the English, save
<hi>Sassanach,</hi> because of <hi>Saxony</hi> from
which they came; as they call'd us
<hi>Albanach</hi> (to distinguish us from
themselves) from the Country to
which we came. Which may give
us likewise a hint, how by Names,
without Histories, most ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of Antiquity may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd:
And it is fully prov'd before
that time, we were known in this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59981:90"/>
Country, under the name of<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Beda</hi> l. 1. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reudini,</hi>
and <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Tacit. <hi>in vita</hi> Agricol.</note>
               <hi>Caledonii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. All those uncontroverted Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,
that make first mention of
the Scots, and of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are only
applicable to us: such as <hi>Claudian,
Pacatius, Ammianus,</hi> &amp;c. as has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been fully prov'd. And since
<hi>Hegesippus</hi> is the first Author produc'd
by the Bp of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> who mentions
<hi>Scotia;</hi> and that it has been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prov'd, that these Passages relate
to Us, and not to <hi>Ireland;</hi> it follows
clearly, that the name <hi>Scotia</hi> was
given to Us, before it was given to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> or that the Irish were call'd
<hi>Scoti:</hi> Albeit it were admitted that
the Works ascribed to <hi>Hegesippus,</hi>
were really St. <hi>Ambroses,</hi> who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
before the Year 400. And
<hi>Cambden</hi> acknowledges that the
Name of <hi>Scotland</hi> came over with
the Scots to <hi>Britain,</hi> cap. 1. <hi>Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
And therefore since I have
prov'd, that the Scots came over
before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s Time; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
from <hi>Cambden,</hi> that the name of
<hi>Scotland</hi> was ascribed to us before
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59981:90"/>
5. Tho it be true, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
on all hands, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was
inhabited by the Nation of the Scots,
as is written by <hi>Orosius</hi> in the Year
417; and that it be true that our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
came from <hi>Ireland,</hi> as <hi>Beda</hi> and
our Historians commonly assert, and
that thence it may be said, that <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernia
est proprie Scotorum Patria.</hi> It
will not follow that either We, or the
Irish were called Scots before that
Time; or that because We have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
our Colony from the <hi>Irish,</hi> that
therefore We have deriv'd the Name
of <hi>Scoti</hi> from them. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
supposing with <hi>Vsher,</hi> that the
<hi>Nomen Scoticum</hi> had been first given
in the third Century, then the Name
behov'd to have been ours original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who were more known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
in the World than they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the honour we had in the
Roman Wars (whose Authors do first
mention <hi>Scoti,</hi> and <hi>Scotia</hi>) and our
early conversion to the Christian
Faith: And by our frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Colonies with the Irish (as
about the time of <hi>Fergus</hi> the second).
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59981:91"/>
It is probable we did communicate
the Name of <hi>Scoti</hi> to these Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whose Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
we were descended, and among
whom our Colonies, that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
setled; as at this day, the
Scots in the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Name, and as we had the
name of <hi>Hibernia</hi> communicated to us
from them; which is abundantly
clear'd from what is said out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius</hi>
and <hi>Gildas.</hi> So that these
names of <hi>Hiberni</hi> and <hi>Scoti</hi> have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
common to both People; but
with this difference, that as the Irish
were originally called <hi>Hiberni;</hi> so
our Scots were originally <hi>Scoti.</hi> For
of all the Passages produced by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Vsher,</hi> or Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi>
to prove the Irish to be called <hi>Scoti,</hi>
that of <hi>Orosius</hi> is the first that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to them: for those from
<hi>Claudian, Ammianus, Pacatius,</hi> and
<hi>Hegisippus</hi> do not at all agree with
them; nor yet that Passage from
<hi>Prosper,</hi> as has been proved; nor
these from <hi>Gildas:</hi> for tho he calls
those People, who are said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home, <hi>Hiberni,</hi> or <hi>Irish;</hi> yet
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59981:91"/>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 117, 118. <hi>inter Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxogr.</hi>
               </note>he calls the same People who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
home, <hi>Scots,</hi> and not <hi>Irish.</hi>
And the Actions to which these Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
cited against us relate, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertedly
by <hi>Beda, Gildas,</hi> and
all the Roman Authors, applicable to
Us, and not to the Irish: being the
three Vastations made by the <hi>Picts,</hi>
and <hi>Vs</hi> in the British Territories.
And <hi>Marianus</hi> (whom the Bishop
likewise cites against us)<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 347. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Basu.</hi>
               </note> does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
apply this to the Scots; for
he uses the word <hi>Scoti,</hi> in speaking
of all the three Vastations. And
whereas <hi>Gildas</hi> useth the word
<hi>Scoti,</hi> speaking of the first two Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations,
and says, <hi>Hiberni rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuntur
domum,</hi> speaking of the last:
<hi>Marianus,</hi> repeating the same pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
says, <hi>Scoti revertuntur domum.</hi>
By which also I infer by a far better
Consequence, that the Scots must
be said to return to the place where
they were formerly settled; but so it
is, that the place where the Scots
were formerly setled was the West
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore when they
return'd home, they return'd not to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> as the Bp of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> alledges,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59981:92"/>
but to our North-west Country, as we
contend: for the word in <hi>Gildas,</hi>
is <hi>√† Gircio,</hi> which signifies North-West;
and <hi>Ireland</hi> lies South-West
from <hi>Grahams-Dyke,</hi> near which
these Actions were done: But <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile,</hi>
and those Isles which We pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,
lies indeed North-West from
it. And if they had return'd to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> they had been <hi>Trans-marine,</hi>
as living in another Isle, contrary
to <hi>Gildas</hi>'s own express assertion,
as it is interpreted by <hi>Beda,</hi> cap. 12.
lib. 2.</p>
            <p>2. Why should the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi>
(being spoke of as to their going
home together, the one to the
North, and the other to the West)
not be thought to have gone home
to the same Isle, since different Isles
are not mentioned? and if I said, I
were going to the West, that in
common sense could only be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
of the West of that <hi>Kingdom</hi>
or Island where I then were; and
not of any other Kingdom lying to
the West thereof. And both the
Picts and Scots being equally called
<hi>Trans-marine</hi> Nations, if the Scots
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59981:92"/>
went out of the Isle, it must follow
that the <hi>Picts</hi> left it also, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any was so ridiculous as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
By all which it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that the words <hi>Scoti &amp; Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berni</hi>
were, before these Times, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously
ascribed to us. And tho
<hi>Beda</hi> may speak of the <hi>Scots</hi> coming
from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and setling a third
Colony in <hi>Britain</hi> long before <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi>'s time, yet that doth only prove
the Antiquity of the Settlement of
the People that are call'd <hi>Scoti,</hi> but
not the Antiquity of their Name,
concerning which <hi>Beda</hi> was not treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for he rather seems to insinuate
the contrary, when<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> he says, <hi>Aquo</hi>
(viz. <hi>duce</hi> Reuda) <hi>usque hodie Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reudini
vocantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The Passages produced by the Bp
of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> &amp; <hi>Vsher,</hi> for proving that
<hi>Ireland</hi> was called <hi>Scotia,</hi> after the
Age that <hi>Hegisippus</hi> or <hi>Ambrose</hi> liv'd
in, and within the 1000 Years, are
very few: and many of them from
Legendary Writers. But I shall
glance at the most material. The
first is <hi>Isidor Hispalensis,</hi> who
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59981:93"/>
liv'd in the 7th Century, and who
says<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 14. cap. <hi>d<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap> insulis.</hi>
               </note> Scotia <hi>eadem &amp;</hi> Hibernia, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xima</hi>
Britanniae <hi>Insula, spatio terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
angustior, sed situ faecundior.</hi>
The same words are used by <hi>Orosius,</hi>
whom he follows, except that <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
calls the Inhabitans <hi>Scoti,</hi> but
does not call the Country <hi>Scotia,</hi>
but <hi>Hibernia:</hi> so that <hi>Orosius</hi> having
first call'd the Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland,
Scoti,</hi> in the Year 417; <hi>Isidor</hi> by
an ordinary derivation calls their
Country <hi>Scotia,</hi> and is the first that
Arch-bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> or the Bishop
of Saint <hi>Asaph,</hi> does produce to
prove <hi>Hibernia</hi> to be call'd <hi>Scotia?</hi>
and is in the Year 620, and so is too
late to prove their Design, since it is
clearly prov'd that our Country
was called <hi>Scotia</hi> in St. <hi>Ambrose</hi>'s
Time, even by their own concession.
And whereas the same <hi>Isidor,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Ireland</hi> says, <hi>haec est proprie</hi>
Scotorum <hi>patria;</hi> beside what has
been formerly urged, it is observable
that the word <hi>proprie</hi> does imply
as if it might have been justly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that it was not true in all
senses: especially since<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 1. lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Beda</hi> uses
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59981:93"/>
the very same expression, after that
he has fully cleared that we were
settled here long before that time:
and therefore it doth necessarly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that these words are consistent
with our being settled here; and
consequently that they must not be
so interpreted, as to infer that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was the place where We then
liv'd but only the place from which
We came: And such as understand
the Civil Law, (the best Standard
of the Latine Language) must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowled,
that there is,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cujac. lib. 14. Obs.</hi> 12. &amp; ad legem 6. parag. gramatici ff. de excus. mum.</note> 
               <hi>Patria Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis,</hi>
as well as <hi>Incolat√ªs &amp; domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilii:</hi>
And it may be justly said of
those of <hi>Virgina</hi> and other English
Plantations, that, Anglia <hi>est proprie
illorum patria:</hi> And generally it is
observable, that the Authors relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both to us and them, do first
call the People <hi>Scoti,</hi> and then the
Country <hi>Scotia:</hi> but still the more
ancient Authors call us <hi>Scoti</hi> before
them, and our Country <hi>Scotia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theirs.</p>
            <p>As to the Citations out of <hi>Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus
in vita Columbae,</hi> and <hi>Beda:</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:59981:94"/>
It is certain that <hi>Adamnanus</hi> is lately
publish'd by an Irish Hand, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Marginal Notes, the
Publisher still adding <hi>Hibernia</hi> in
the Magin, where <hi>Scotia</hi> is in the
Text. But however it is certain that
<hi>Adamnanus</hi> was Abbot of <hi>Hy,</hi> which
is <hi>Ikolmkil</hi> among the Scotish West
Islands: so that in <hi>dubio</hi> he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
to be a Scots-man, and not
an Irish; and <hi>Balaeus</hi> and others po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
assert him to be a Scots-man.
Nor is there any reason for their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him an Irish-man; but because
all Authors who speak of him, call
him <hi>Scotus;</hi> and to assert a Man to
be an Irish-man, because he is called
Scots-man, is rather a Bull than a
Reason. But because he is mention'd
by <hi>Beda,</hi> who liv'd shortly after him,
and is an Author of far greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
What I shall observe from
<hi>Beda,</hi> will serve to clear the Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of both.</p>
            <p>And first, <hi>Beda</hi>

               <hi>The English and Scots

(as well as the others which I have
cited, and shall cite) proves, 1. That
<hi>Scotland</hi> then was promiscuously
express'd by the names of <hi>Hibernia</hi>
and <hi>Scotia:</hi> For the same thing is said
first to have been done in <hi>Hibernia,</hi>
and thereafter it is said to have been
done in <hi>Scotia:</hi> And this answers the
Objection, <hi>Hiberni revertuntur do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum;</hi>
and where could their Home
be but in <hi>Ireland?</hi> 2. It proves that
this our Country was call'd <hi>Scotia</hi> in
<hi>Beda</hi>'s Time; and so long before the
Year 1000, which the Bishop denies.
Nor can it be prov'd that the King
of <hi>Northumberland</hi> went to make

War in <hi>Ireland;</hi> nor speaks <hi>Beda</hi>
of any War with <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Passage from <hi>Beda</hi> is,
where he says,<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>That</hi>

‚ÄîAll whom the Scots kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,

And thereafter speaking of <hi>Egbert,</hi>

was the Isle of <hi>Hy,</hi> or <hi>Icolm-kill,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:59981:96"/>
But for further clearing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Citations, from <hi>Beda</hi> I shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
these following Considerations.
1. That <hi>Beda</hi> treats only the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of these five Nations that did
inhabite <hi>Britain:</hi> and if he do speak
of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is but upon
occasion of them; as of the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Ireland</hi> from whence the
Scots came, or of some Monasteries
depending upon <hi>Icolm-kill,</hi> which
perhaps were situated near us, in the
North of <hi>Ireland:</hi> and therefore
unless all these passages were clearly
applicable to <hi>Ireland,</hi> they must be
understood of <hi>Scotland.</hi> 2. It being
certain, that <hi>Beda,</hi> in the beginning
of his Book, treats concerning the
<hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Wars
with them, and <hi>Palladius</hi>'s being
sent to them, it necessarily follows,
that the rest of the Book mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scots, or that part of the
Isle possess'd by them, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of us, whether the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
be called <hi>Hibernia</hi> or <hi>Scotia,</hi>
or We <hi>Hiberni</hi> or <hi>Scoti:</hi> especially
since <hi>Beda</hi> mentions a King call'd
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59981:97"/>
               <hi>Aidan;</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Buch. <hi>p.</hi> 152.</note> we had a King of
that Name in that time, which the
<hi>Irish</hi> cannot pretend. <hi>Beda</hi> treats
also concerning the Abbots of <hi>Hy,</hi>
which is <hi>Icolm-kill,</hi> as is clear by
that passage,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Columba</hi> fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dator monasterii quod in <hi>Hy</hi> ins<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Founder of the Monastery in
the Isle of</hi> Hy, <hi>venerable to the</hi> Scots
<hi>and</hi> Picts, <hi>which by a compounded
name from</hi> Columba <hi>and</hi> Cell <hi>is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
Icolm-kill. And that the Monks
sent from this Monastery, or Island,
were the Converters of the <hi>North-Saxons,</hi>
and the first Bishops of
<hi>Lindasfern</hi> or <hi>Holy-Island?</hi> Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of the Bishop of <hi>Durham.</hi> 3. He
makes frequent mention of little
Islands, which never did belong to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> but to <hi>Sotland,</hi> and are
still called <hi>Hebrides;</hi> And so as the
chief of these Isles where the Abbot
resided the Records were kept, and
the Kings were buried, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be called <hi>Insula Hiberniae,</hi> or
<hi>Hibernia,</hi> and that <hi>Scotia</hi> might be
the Ordinary name to all that part
of the Isle of <hi>Britain</hi> benorth the
River of <hi>Clyde:</hi> so that the going
from <hi>Hiberni√¢,</hi> or <hi>Scoti√¢, in Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam,</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:59981:97"/>
is nothing but the going to

and <hi>Graham's-Dyke,</hi> that part of the
Isle was distinguished from the rest,
as if it had been a distinct Island.

Time being about the
keeping of <hi>Easter, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius
Mellitus,</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi>
Bishops, did write

preach the Gospel unto the
Heathens in these Western
Parts; and that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to us to come into this
Isle which is called</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<hi>we held in religious
reverence both the</hi> Scots
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59981:98"/>
               <hi>and</hi> Britons, <hi>believing that they did
walk after the Custom of the</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Church. <hi>But after we had known
the</hi> Britons, <hi>we judg'd the</hi> Scots <hi>to
be the better minded: Yet now we
perceive by</hi> Dagamus, <hi>the Bishop
who is come hither, and by</hi> Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus
<hi>the Abbot in</hi> France, <hi>that the
Scots differ nothing in their Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the Britons; for</hi> Dagamus
<hi>being here, refused not only to eat
with us, but even to stay in the same
Inn or Lodging.</hi> Now that this is
only applicable to us, and not to
the Scots in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Subject
doth prove, being Exhortatory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to conform in the Observation
of <hi>Easter,</hi> wherein the British Scots,
who follow'd <hi>Columba,</hi> differ'd from
the Roman Church. 2. The Letter
is written to the Scots, and relates
to other Letters written to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
in the same Isle; and who need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same Exhortation. And it is
to be remembred, That <hi>Vsher</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
concludes, that where the
Scots and Britons are mention'd in
Conjunction, by Scots there, are
to be understood the British Scots.

               </note> But to take
off all Debate, <hi>Beanus</hi> is
nam'd in our <hi>Chartula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
as well as <hi>Histories,</hi>
as the first Bishop of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdeen:</hi>
and the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
granted to him
by our King <hi>Malcom 2d,</hi>
in the Year 1010, of the

are yet extant: and his

            <p>To the former Passages I must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
add, That albeit our Country
was promiscuously call'd <hi>Scotia,</hi> and
<hi>Hibernia,</hi> as has been prov'd, yet
<hi>Scotia,</hi> even in that Time, was the
more frequent Name of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
and which, to keep close to
<hi>Beda,</hi> appears; for when he speaks
of the Isle <hi>Hy,</hi> (to which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

which was the place of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59981:99"/>
in which his History being Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick,

thereafter he tells, That

               <hi>Beda,</hi> writing

<hi>Abbot and Presbyter of the

               <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Adamnanus <hi>reversus ad</hi> Scotiam. Bed. <hi>l. 5. c.</hi> 22.</note>he tells, that <hi>he returned

And how can it be denied
that <hi>Hy</hi> is in <hi>Scotland?</hi> since <hi>Beda</hi>
calls it <hi>Scotland,</hi> and says, That <hi>it
belong'd to</hi> Britain: and is by all
Geographers nam'd one of our <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides,</hi>
and lies locally within our
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59981:100"/>
Country; and was one of the first
places which we planted, and far
remoter from <hi>Ireland,</hi> than <hi>Kintire</hi>
and others of our Islands; and in
which our Kings were buried, and
our Records kept.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Proposition, I
shall add these Reflections.</p>
            <p>1. That it is not so easy for the
Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> to explicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as to these Passages concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Scotia</hi> and <hi>Scoti,</hi> and to make
them signifie <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> since
the 500 Year, as before: for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
that the Terms were anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
applicable to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that
the <hi>Scots</hi> when mention'd here, were
but by Invasion from <hi>Ireland;</hi> Yet
it being acknowledg'd, that after
the Year 500 we were settled here;
It follows, that when <hi>Scotia</hi> and
<hi>Scoti</hi> are mention'd in relation to
British affairs, and in conjuction with
the Inhabitans of <hi>Britain,</hi> they must
be understood of us, and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
2. <hi>Beda</hi> mentioning our
Country to be call'd <hi>Scotia,</hi> as well
as <hi>Hibernia,</hi> from <hi>Columba</hi>'s Time to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59981:100"/>
his own, it is not only an evidence,
that it was so call'd in that Time, but
that the Name had not been then
first given, otherwise he could not
have been ignorant of the Change,
nor would he have failed to remark
it: so that we may reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in his sense, the Name of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
is as ancient in <hi>Britain,</hi> as the
Time he mentions the Settlement,
Wars, and Religion of the Scots
there. 3. It is evident, That the Bp of
St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 1. ¬ß. 9<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </note> Proposition is faulty, <hi>viz.</hi>
That, <hi>when we settled here after the
Year 500, our Kingdom was call'd</hi>
Argyle, <hi>or</hi> Dalrieda: for if this had
been true, this name being so recent,
could not but have been noticed and
used by <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi> and yet
it is never so much as once mention'd
by either of them; tho <hi>Beda,</hi> upon
the occasion of the Monastery of <hi>Hy,</hi>
or <hi>Icolm-kill,</hi> and of the Bishops sent
thence to <hi>England,</hi> doth frequently
mention the Names <hi>Hibernia</hi> and
<hi>Scotia,</hi> and that St. <hi>Asaph</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 5. ¬ß. 4<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> doth not
controvert, but that these Bishops
were sent from our Isle of <hi>Icolm-kill</hi>
to <hi>England.</hi> 4. We may observe how
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59981:101"/>
warrantable<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 734.</note> Arch-bishop <hi>Vsher</hi>'s
Position (repeated by the Bishop of
St. <hi>Asaph</hi>) is, That no Author men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
our Country by the name of
<hi>Scotia</hi> for the first 1000 years; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
most of all the former Authors, both
within and without the Isle, prove
<hi>Scotia</hi> to have been the name of our
Country: and the whole Tract of
<hi>Beda</hi>'s History proves, that since the
year 560, this Country was generally
so called: Whereas neither <hi>Gildas,</hi>
nor <hi>Beda,</hi> who lived near that Time,
and wrote whole Books of us, do
once call it <hi>Dalrieda,</hi> or <hi>Argyle:</hi>
and consequently (as I observ'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s
whole Sect. 9. of the first Chapter,
wherein he asserts, that about the
Year 500, the Scots erected the
Kingdom of <hi>Argile,</hi> or <hi>Dalrieda,</hi>
is most unwarrantable; for though
<hi>Beda</hi> calls us once <hi>Dalreudini,</hi> yet
this is spoken of us by him, in the
Time of our King <hi>Reuda,</hi> and so
near 70 Years before the 503 af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christ. And from this also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
a clear confutation of what
the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> asserts,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59981:101"/>
that no Author writing within the
1000 Years, and naming <hi>Scotia,</hi>
means Us; which is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, that no Author of Credit
(<hi>Isidore</hi> only excepted) did then
by <hi>Scotia</hi> mean <hi>Ireland.</hi> And the
best Authority that Arch-bishop
<hi>Vsher</hi> gives us for <hi>Dalrieda,</hi> is <hi>Ioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin;</hi>
which my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi> hath
improved by a new authority out
of a Manuscript of the Lord <hi>Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi>'s,
where the Author thinks that
<hi>Dalrieda,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile,</hi>
are the same. Authors not to
be once mentioned with those whom
we cite.</p>
            <p>7. The distinction of <hi>Scotia Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi>
and <hi>Minor,</hi> is lately invented;
for either <hi>Ireland</hi> was called <hi>Scotia
Major</hi> before the Year 1000, or
only since: if the first, then it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
implyeth, that at that Time
our Country was also call'd <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
Minor,</hi> there being no other
place assignable. But this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Arch-bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> and
my Lord St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s Position, who
deny our Country was called <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:59981:102"/>
at all for the first 1000 Years.
If it be asserted that this distinction
was after the 1000 Years, then there
was little or no use for it: For
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 734.</note>
               <hi>Vsher</hi> tells us, that <hi>Nubiensis Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphus,</hi>
about the Year 1150, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
<hi>Ireland</hi> by the name of <hi>Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and describes our Country by
the name of <hi>Scotia:</hi> and so it seems
at that time <hi>Ireland</hi> had lost the name
in our favour; and it is not to be
imagin'd that <hi>Nubiensis</hi> remarked
the first Periods of the change of
the Name; and Geographers do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
Countries by their ordinary
Names. Nor does <hi>Vsher</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 724, &amp; 737.</note> produce
any other Testimony, save a Letter of
<hi>Dovenaldus Oneil</hi> Prince of <hi>Vlster</hi> to
Pope <hi>Iohn 22d,</hi> wherein there is this
passage,<note n="*" place="margin">Quod praeter Reges minoris <hi>Scotiae,</hi> qui om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes de nostra <hi>majore Scotia</hi> originem sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sero.</note> 
               <hi>Beside the Kings of lesser</hi>
Scotland, <hi>who all came originally
from our</hi> greater Scotland. And a
Patent of <hi>Sigismund</hi> the Emperor,
<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Conventus</hi> Scotorum <hi>&amp;</hi> Hibernorum <hi>de</hi> majore Scotia <hi>Monasterii ia</hi> Ratisbona.</note>
               <hi>To the Convent of the</hi> Scots <hi>and</hi>
Irish <hi>of</hi> Greater Scotland <hi>of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
in</hi> Ratisbone. Now <hi>Vsher</hi>
acknowledgeth the eldest of these
two Citations, were in the <hi>14th</hi> or
<hi>15th</hi> Century; when I hope no
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59981:102"/>
body will assert, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Scotia Major,</hi> or that ever the
Kings of <hi>England,</hi> who were Lords
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were ever called Lords
<hi>Majoris Scotiae;</hi> and it is probable
they would have very much affected
that Title (if the Country had had
that name) altho they could never
make themselves Masters <hi>Scotiae Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris.</hi>
But it is no wonder, that
the Irish should be glad to tell Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
that they were our Chief,
and so their Country ought to be
called <hi>Scotia Major;</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that our Nation was then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
great and glorious: and that
<hi>Vsher</hi> can find no better authority
for his distinction of <hi>Scotia Major</hi> and
<hi>Minor,</hi> than these borrowed and
magnifying Names, used long after
he himself acknowledgeth that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had lost the name of <hi>Scotia,</hi> and
that We were only in possession of
it.</p>
            <p>8. The mistaking of the Names
of <hi>Scotia</hi> and <hi>Hibernia,</hi> and of that
assertion, Scotia <hi>eadem &amp;</hi> Hibernia,
and applying these Names still to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59981:103"/>
               <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not to our Country, hath
been the Ground whereupon we
have been injured, as to the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Country, Saints</hi>
and <hi>learned Men, Monasteries,</hi> and
<hi>greatness Abroad.</hi> For admitting it
to be true, that we were not setled
here till the Year 500, yet we have
been so happy, as to have such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Men, and to have done so
considerable Actions, as have been
sufficient to tempt our Neighbours,
and particularly the Irish, to take
great pains to have both pass for
their own. In order to which the
Irish have lately invented the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of <hi>Scotia Major</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi>
to the end, that when any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Person is called a Scots-man
in History, they might claim him as
descended from the <hi>Greater Scotland.</hi>
But besides, that this distinction is
too new to be extended to ancient
Writers, How can it be imagined
that our Country, only having pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
under the Name of <hi>Scotland</hi>
before the 300, and after the 1100,
as has been proved, <hi>Ireland</hi> should
have assumed the Name of <hi>Scotland</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:59981:103"/>
in that Interval? Is it not more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to think that our Country,
which alone was design'd by that
Name, before the 300, and after
1100, bore it likewise only, or at
least chiefly, during that interval.
But to assert that, during that space,
another Country had our old and
present designation in a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner than we; and that in
dubious Cases it must be appropriated
to them, is a piece of confidence
which even eminent Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot support. And yet we
find, in <hi>Malcom</hi> the Second's Time,
(as was formerly observ'd) who
began to Reign in the Year 1004,
That the Frith of <hi>Forth</hi> (in his
Laws, in the Book of <hi>Regiam Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestatem</hi>)
is call'd <hi>Mare Scotiae:</hi>
And it is said there, that the same
King did distribute, <hi>omnem Terram</hi>
Scotiae <hi>hominibus suis:</hi> and it is not
to be concluded, that this was the
first time that our Country was
so call'd. And about that time <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was expressed only by the name
of <hi>Hibernia;</hi> for King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> who began to Reign
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59981:104"/>
in the Year 1154, is stiled <hi>Lord of
Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to clear further that <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
about those times was the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
name for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Heber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
for <hi>Ireland,</hi> I shall only add
some few Passages out of <hi>Marianus
Scotus,</hi> who was born in the Year
1028, and died in the Year 1086,
<note n="*" place="margin">Brianus <hi>Rex</hi> Hiberniae <hi>neca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> pag. 423.</note>who sayes, that about the Year

               <hi>Machetad</hi> King of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
All which passages agree exactly
with our History, and the summary
of our Kings Lives, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in our Acts of Parliament,
and prove that <hi>Marianus</hi> treats of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as different
Kingdoms in his Time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:59981:104"/>
In the last place, I shall make some
Remarks upon the most palpable of
these Mistakes, and of the chief Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
thereof: wherein I shall vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the Right and Dignity of our
Country, and assert these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Persons controverted to be ours.
I shall not insist much against <hi>Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst,</hi>
he being solidly confuted by
<note n="*" place="margin">Appen. ad l. 3.</note>
               <hi>Camerarius,</hi> and with that severity
by <hi>Dempster,</hi> that his Nephew
Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> (as the Duke of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdail</hi>
remarked in some Judicious
Reflections of his upon this occasion)
did highly resent it, and in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath exceeded his usual Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Moderation. And yet
<hi>Stanihurst</hi> never speaks injuriously
of our Nation; for though he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
many things, and applys them
to his own Country; yet it
appears to be, rather of Design to
magnifie it, than injure ours: for
he acknowledeth ingenuously,<note n="*" place="margin">

Fables and Vain glory with his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;
yet he neither disapproves
of <hi>Buchannan,</hi> nor follows he <hi>Luddus,</hi>

two Chapters contends, that before
St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s time our Country was
called <hi>Scotia;</hi> and brings for proofs
St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> who asserts that the Scots
were <hi>Gens Britannica;</hi> but with great
concern he vindicates us from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
of eating Mens Flesh: and for
our Antiquity he cites <hi>Beda,</hi> who
says, that <hi>Sub duce Rend√¢</hi> we made
a third Nation in <hi>Britain.</hi> So that
we see that neither the Welsh in <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus</hi>'s
time, nor the Irish in <hi>Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst</hi>'s
time, had the Opinion of our
late Settlement, and that our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was not call'd <hi>Scotia</hi> for 1000
Years after Christ; which their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
<hi>Luddus, Cambden, Vsher</hi> and
St. <hi>Asaph</hi> have had. And the <hi>Irish</hi>
in those days took a far better
way for advancing their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in doing us justice; since
from all the considerable Actions we
did, there did arise a measure of that
Honour to them, from whose Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
we came as a Colony: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
since they were influenc'd by
Strangers, they have suffer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be impos'd upon, so as to
lessen our true Merit, in appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59981:106"/>
immediatly to themselves those
devout persons, who were really our
Country-men: not considering
that the material unjustice was much
greater than the imaginary honour:
And this <hi>Plagiarism</hi> and <hi>Man-stealing</hi>
became easie to them since our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
from Popery, because after
that time we became too careless of
those eminent Persons both at home
and abroad, who had liv'd in the
Roman Communion, or before that
time. But I will not insist on this,
for I hope their native kindness will
incline them to return to their first
just methods.</p>
            <p>If I had leisure, I would make lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Reflections,<note place="margin">Pag. 789.</note> to prove how uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequential
Arch Bp <hi>Vsher</hi> is, in making
<hi>Sedulus</hi> and <hi>Marianus</hi> Irish: since
by all Writers they are both call'd
<hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Balaeus</hi> an Englishman tells
us, that<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Pag. 187. Cent. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Sedulius</hi> flourish'd under <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus
2d.</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 210. Cent. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Marianus</hi> under <hi>Macbeth,</hi>
both our Kings; and <hi>Baronius</hi> asserts
also this positively. And <hi>Sedulius</hi>
having liv'd before St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Time
(who was the first Apostle of <hi>Ireland</hi>)
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59981:106"/>
and being Disciple to <hi>Hildebert</hi> an
acknowledg'd Scot, and who liv'd in
the 390, must be prior to the Irish
Christianity; which <hi>Giraldus</hi> and
<hi>Stanihurst</hi> acknowledge to have
been first planted by St. <hi>Patrick</hi> in
the Year 432. Nor can<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 789.</note> 
               <hi>Vsher</hi> in
all his vast reading, find any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in <hi>Ireland</hi> betwixt the Year 400,
and 432, which was St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s
Time, but <hi>Kiaranus, Ailbeus, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Ibarus:</hi> Tho if <hi>Sedulius</hi> had
been an Irish, he had been certainly
mention'd and employ'd, before those
obscure Persons; and certainly he
would have employed himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Time in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of his own native Country,
if he had been truly Irish. And as
to <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> it is a wonder
how it can be controverted that he
was a Scots-man; since our Country
was then called <hi>Scotland</hi> by the Bp of
St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s own confession; and <hi>Ireland</hi>
was just then losing that name; and
<hi>Marianus</hi> in his whole Book distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
betwixt <hi>Scoti</hi> and <hi>Hiberni,</hi>
and mentions the forementioned
three Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> about whose
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59981:107"/>
Time he liv'd; and also makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one King of <hi>Ireland</hi> about
that time: as has been observed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
and particularly, speaking of
the Conversions<note n="*" place="margin">Ad <hi>Scotos</hi> in <hi>Christum</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes ordinatus √† <hi>Papa</hi> Caelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no <hi>Palladius</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Episcopus missus est.

St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> he expresly distinguishes
betwixt <hi>Scoti,</hi> and <hi>Hibernenses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But passing these, I confess it is
pretty ridiculous to see a whole
Book written by the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Vardaeus,</hi> and glossed by <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
and published at <hi>Louvain</hi> 1662,
to prove that <hi>Rumoldus</hi> Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Mechlin</hi> was an Irish-man: since
the Arms of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which are,
<hi>Or, a Lion Rampant Gules, within
a doubles Tressure flowred and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflowred
with Flower de lis of the
same</hi>) are plac'd upon every Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the Catherdral Church built
by him, and are to this day a part of the
Arms of that Archi-Episcopal See, <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moldus</hi>
himself being a younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>Royal-Family</hi> of <hi>Scotland:</hi>
And in which witty Book, the
Author, to confute this,<note n="*" place="margin">Artic. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> pag. 281.</note> is forced
to maintain that the Scotish Lion is
born by several Irish Familes; And
the double Tressure, tho anciently
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59981:107"/>
born by <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which is
Blazon'd in that Archi-Episcopal
Coat of Arms, might have been born
by the Irish, because that famous
League betwixt the Scots and <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi>
was made with the Kings
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not with the Kings
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that our Kings
had never any Leagues with the
<hi>French,</hi> till the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> 7th
who was contemporary with our
King <hi>Iames</hi> 1st: Whereas the whole
French Histories, as well as ours;
and all Foreign Historians, as well
as either, the Leagues yet extant;
the Priviledges granted thereupon
to us, recorded in the French Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters,
and ours; many Decisions
in Parliaments, and other Courts;
and the universal consent of all the
French who ever liv'd since that
Time, do in all Humility seem to be
sufficient Warrants for laughing at
this monstruous Assertion; as I do
at him and others, who pretend that
the Scotish Monasteries in <hi>Germany,</hi>
are Irish: since they were founded
in <hi>Charle-Maigne</hi>'s Time, by <hi>William</hi>
Brother to our King <hi>Achaius,</hi> and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59981:108"/>
others that went there with him;
and they are to this day govern'd by
Abbots and Priors of our Country:
Nor can it be understood, how the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> could mistake
their own Records and <hi>Foundations</hi>
for so many hundreds of Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and by this I leave my Reader
to measure the other unjust preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of such Authors.</p>
            <p>I hope it now at last appears, that
I have detected those ingenious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices,
which this learn'd Bishop was
forc'd to use, to supply his want of
solid and just grounds in this his
undertaking. As,</p>
            <p>1. That, to conciliate respect to
this Undertaking, as well as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
it, he pretends that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the defence of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
            <p>2. He makes a great muster of
old Authors in the beginning of his
Book, as if all these were Men of
great credit, and did concur with
him to refute our History; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorns
his Margins with formidable
numbers of Citations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:59981:108"/>
3. Knowing that it could be
prov'd, both by British and Foreign
Historians, that we were here very
anciently, he confesses this; but by
a new and strange Invention, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
that we were not here as settled
Inhabitants, but only by way of
Incursion.</p>
            <p>4. He defers our Setling here, till
the Year 503, and so longer than
the first Inventors of this new Story
did; upon design to make our Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
here, later then that of the
<hi>Anglo-Saxons,</hi> who settl'd here in
<hi>Anno</hi> 449.</p>
            <p>5. He lessens the reputation of
all our Historians, and endeavours
also to make them pass but for one;
as if the succeeding Historian had
seen no other Warrants, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Histories.</p>
            <p>6. He treats in ridicule <hi>Ieffrey,</hi> and
some other Historians of his own
Country, whom he knew could
not be sustain'd however; and this
he does upon design, to shew his
impartiality, and that he spares not
his own more than ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:59981:109"/>
7. For the same reason he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crys
the British descent from <hi>Brutus:</hi>
in which he loses nothing, because
no sober Man could have defended
it; and he denies the Conversion of
their own King <hi>Lucius,</hi> to strike
thereby with the greater authority
at the Antiquity of our <hi>Royal-Line</hi>
and <hi>Nation,</hi> treating King <hi>Donald</hi>'s
Conversion also as a Fable: and
thus according to our Proverb, <hi>He
is content to let a Friend go with a
Foe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. He complements our Nation
in latter Times, to excuse the Injury
he does our Kings and Antiquity.</p>
            <p>9. He uses the Foreign Authors
that should be urg'd for us, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
our using of them as proving
Arguments against him.</p>
            <p>10. Finding that <hi>Ireland</hi> has been
call'd <hi>Scotia,</hi> he transplants our old
Saints thither, and applies to it, all
that is said of our Country: nor
did ever any Author improve better
a pitiful Clinch.</p>
            <p>11. He concurs in another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
like to this: for, because it
could not be deny'd that <hi>Fergus</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:59981:109"/>
was our first King; all the Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for proving this, are therefore
apply'd to <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second, and
not to <hi>Fergus</hi> the First.</p>
            <p>Lastly; Whereas <hi>Cambden</hi> and
Arch-bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> speak doubtingly
of their own Arguments; the Bishop
of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> fearing that his Reader
could not be convinc'd, of what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was not, he therefore proposesall
these Arguments, with a confidence,
which would seem to argue that full
conviction in himself, which he wishes
in others.</p>
            <p>If any Person then would know
how that <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was but
a small Colony, grew up to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that deserv'd so well: my
thoughts of this are, that, 1. The
constant defence that we were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to make against the <hi>Romans</hi>
and <hi>Britons</hi> at first, and <hi>English</hi>
thereafter, Nations wise, brave, and
polish'd, living in the same Isle with
us, and the <hi>Picts</hi> within us, did force us
to think and fight; and the observing
the Actions &amp; Conduct of such Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
could not leave the observers
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59981:110"/>
rude or ignorant: and it's like that
the Glory of such Noble Adversaries,
rais'd our Wit and Courage above
the pitch of a Northen and confin'd
Nation. 2. Our Country hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had the happiness to stop the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Conquest, this gave Strangers a
value for us; and therefore when
any of the gallant <hi>Britons</hi> scorn'd to
submit to the slavery and drudgery
of a Conquest, they fled unto us
from the <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes,</hi>
and <hi>Normans;</hi> and being passionate
lovers of Liberty, they animated us
by their Assistance and Example. This
likewise brought in brave Strangers
amongst us, as all gallant Spirits did
lately run to <hi>Holland</hi> in its first rise:
and (as our Historians probably
relate) very many of those return'd
with <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second from the
Wars in <hi>Italy,</hi> whither that generous
young Prince went to assist <hi>Alarick</hi>
against the <hi>Romans,</hi> in a just resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the injury done by them to
his Predecessors, and with whom he
was present at the sacking of <hi>Rome.</hi>
3. We have been very happy in so
Heroick and Wife a Race of Kings,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59981:110"/>
whose Blood being refin'd by a long
Royal Descent, hath been thereby
purifiy'd from all meanness, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
to that Love for glory, which
is ordinary in those, who never knew
what it was to obey. 4. Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
having entered early into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
League with <hi>France,</hi> in
the Reign of <hi>Charle-Maigne;</hi> our
Country-men got excellent Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
under so Wise and Valiant a
Prince; and have ever since, by being
constantly employed in the <hi>French,</hi>
and other Wars, attain'd to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Merit, beyond what was to
be expected in this Climate. 5. Our
Country having neither Bogs nor
Fogs, our Ground being Rocky
and Gravelly, and our Air fann'd
by Winds; this preserves us from
the dulness and phlegm of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Climats; and the want of that
superfluous Plenty, and bewitching
Pleasure, which softned even <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
when he came to <hi>Capua,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
us against the Delicacy and
Effeminateness of Southern Nations.
And whereas (Heroick Virtue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still attended by Envy) some
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59981:111"/>
in railery pretend, that we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer'd,
because we deserv'd not
the pains and trouble of a War. I
need not seriously answer, what no
Historian can urge: For it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
to think, that the <hi>Romans</hi>
would not have rather conquer'd
us, than built two strong and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive
Walls against us, which
bounded their Fame, as well as their
Conquest. And <hi>England</hi> hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
too much pains to gain us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Conquest or Alliance, to
have undervalued us. And though
when we were divided by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
betwixt the <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liol</hi>
of old, and betwixt the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists</hi>
and <hi>Covenanters</hi> of late; the
half of our Country having only
defended its Liberties, whilst the
other half joyn'd with its Enemies;
we were rather betray'd than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome:
And yet we soon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
our former Liberty. Albeit,
to be overcome by <hi>England</hi> had been
no great affront to us: <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a greater and richer Nation than
we are. And therefore I hope, all
honest Men will, with Judicious
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59981:111"/>
               <hi>Samuel Daniel</hi> in his History, at the
Year 1296, confess, that it had been
a pity, we had not had a better
Country, to be the Theatre of so
many worthy and heroick Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Having thus clear'd how our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
arriv'd at its present consistence,
I am to finish this Discourse, with a
representation of the many Rights
which our Kings have to the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Throne</hi> of these Kingdoms; and
to show how they succeed to all who
ever pretended to Monarchy in any
of them.</p>
            <p>As to the British part of the Isle,
<hi>Aurelius Ambrosius</hi> was, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent, chosen sole Prince of
all the <hi>Britons:</hi> And he had no
other Succession, save two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>Anna</hi> married to the King of
the <hi>Picts,</hi> and <hi>Ada</hi> married to the
King of the <hi>Scots. Mordredus</hi> King
of the <hi>Picts,</hi> Grand-child to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Aurelius,</hi> finding himself debarr'd
from the Succession of the British
Crown, employ'd the Scots, who
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59981:112"/>
fought for him against the <hi>Britons.</hi>
But the <hi>Britons</hi> having called in the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> after a bloody Battel, both
Parties were forced to withdraw;
and the King of the <hi>Picts</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to desist from his Pretentions
at that time. But thereafter <hi>Hungus,</hi>
King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> and the direct
Heir of the same <hi>Mordredus,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of <hi>Ambrosius</hi> King of the
<hi>Britons,</hi> gave his Sister <hi>Fergusiana</hi> to
<hi>Achaius</hi> King of the <hi>Scots;</hi> and in
her Right, <hi>Alpin</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi>
succeeded both to the British and
Pictish Crowns; <hi>Hungus</hi> having died
without any Children, <hi>Kenneth</hi> the
<hi>2d,</hi> Son to <hi>Alpin,</hi> was forc'd to
conquer the <hi>Picts,</hi> who refus'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
to receive him as their lawful
King.</p>
            <p>Our Kings are likewise Lineal
Heirs of the Danish-Race, who were
Kings of <hi>England</hi> for 27, or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say, 29 Years; they being the
only Lineal Successors of <hi>Canutus</hi>
King of the <hi>Danes</hi> in <hi>Britain:</hi> for
<hi>Margaret,</hi> Wife to King <hi>Malcolm</hi> the
<hi>3d,</hi> was Sister to <hi>Edgar,</hi> which <hi>Edgar</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:59981:112"/>
was Grand-child to St. <hi>Edward,</hi> who
was Brother to <hi>Hardiknut,</hi> Son to
<hi>Canutus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
return'd to the old Stock
in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Time; to whom
succeeded <hi>Edgar,</hi> whose Sister the
pious Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> married King
<hi>Malcolm</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by
whom he came to have right to the
Crown of <hi>England;</hi> there being
none extant of the old <hi>Royal-Saxon-Line</hi>
besides her self: And with
her came very many of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
who fled from <hi>William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,</hi>
after he conquer'd <hi>England,</hi>
and with whom King <hi>Malcolm</hi> would
not make Peace, till such of them
as resolved to return were restored
to their Estates.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Royal-Race</hi> which flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
in <hi>England,</hi> was the <hi>Norman:</hi>
and to that Race our Kings succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thus.</p>
            <p>The Line of <hi>William the Conqueror</hi>
was branch'd out in the Houses of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York.</hi> To the House of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59981:113"/>
               <hi>Lancaster,</hi> they succeed as Heirs by
the marriage betwixt <hi>Ioan</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Successor of the Family of
<hi>Lancaster.</hi> And to both <hi>Lancaster</hi>
and <hi>York</hi> they succeed, by being
Heirs to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th;</hi> in whom
these Successions were again happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reconcil'd; he having married
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> eldest Daughter to <hi>Edward</hi>
the <hi>4th,</hi> who had transferred the
Succession of the <hi>Crown</hi> from the
House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to that of <hi>York,</hi>
or at least had united the two in
one. For clearing whereof, it is
fit to know, that <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> had
only four Children, <hi>Arthur, Henry,
Margaret,</hi> and <hi>Mary. Arthur,</hi> and
<hi>Henry</hi> dying without Succession,
the Right of the <hi>Crown</hi> was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
devolv'd upon the Children
of <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter; who did
bear King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> in a first
Marriage with King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>4th;</hi>
and <hi>Margaret Dowglas,</hi> by a second
Marriage with the Earl of <hi>Angus:</hi>
which <hi>Margaret</hi> being married to
<hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> had two
Sons; the eldest whereof was <hi>Henry,</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:59981:113"/>
who thereafter married Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
Daughter to King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>5th;</hi>
and begot upon her King <hi>Iames</hi>
the <hi>6th:</hi> and thus King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>6th</hi>
was upon all sides Heir to <hi>William
the Conquerour,</hi> and to <hi>Henry</hi> the
<hi>7th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Histories also of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
confess, that our King is the
undoubted Successor of the <hi>Blood-Royal</hi>
of <hi>Wales:</hi> for <hi>Walter Stuart,</hi>
from whom our Kings are descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was Grand-Child to the King of

and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> (to whom King
<hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> was the true Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor)
was also the righteous Heir
of <hi>Cadwallader</hi> the last Prince of
<hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Histories both of <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ireland</hi> do acknowledg, that our
Kings are undoubtedly descended
from the Royal Race of the Kings
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and all the debate that
can be, is only whether they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sended
from King <hi>Ferquhard,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59981:114"/>
to King <hi>Fergus</hi> the first, or
from <hi>Eeric</hi> Father to King <hi>Fergus</hi> the
second; or from some other Irish
Kings, as <hi>Vsher</hi> pretends.</p>
            <p>From all which I may draw two
Conclusions; First, that God has,
from an extraordinary kindness to
those Kingdoms, lodged in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our present Soveraign, King
<hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> (whom <hi>GOD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>
long preseve) all those op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite,
and different Rights, by which
our Peace might have been formerly
disturb'd. 2. That His <hi>Majesty</hi> who
now Reigns, has deriv'd from His
Royal Ancestors, a just and legal
Right by Law, to all those Crowns,
without needing to found upon the
Right of Conquest: so that the very
endeavour, to exclude him from all
those Legal Rights, by Arbitrary
Insolence, under a Mask of Law,
was the height of Injustice, as well
as Imprudence.</p>
