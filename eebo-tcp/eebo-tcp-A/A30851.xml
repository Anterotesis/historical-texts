            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving met with Success in a Poem of this Nature, I was incourag'd to proceed, and lay the Scene again in a Country that, perhaps, hath not been, nor is now inferior for Heroick Personages to any part of the World; and if It is not so esteem'd, it has been through the dulness of our Historians, or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude or Designs of our Poets, who may think it an easier Course to write of the Improbable and Romantick Actions of Princes remote, both by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Time and Place, than to be confin'd at home, where ev'ry School-Boy has a right to be a Crittick, and ev'ry Gentleman an Interest to stand the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of his Family, against a rash and inconsiderate Author. I say not this to derogate from those

Excellency of Your real Perfections; and though her Merits rais'd her to a Crown, and she was Queen, her Fortunes were less Miraculous than Yours. For Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without a Diadem, never showr'd down so many admirable Blessings of Virtue, Beauty, Birth, Wit, and Fortune, upon any One of Your Sex before. I dare no further attempt their Description with my Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, lest I speak too Meanly or Irreverently of 'em; therefore I'le leave the mighty Subject to some more Glorious Pen: For none but a <hi>Cowley,</hi> or the best of <hi>Laureats,</hi> ought to write of you: My mean Stile has no other Ornament than Truth; and with that, and in all Humility, I return Thanks for Your most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Acceptance of so poor a Trifle, which has scarce given a more happy Life to the Play, than it has to the Author, who is, Madam,</p>

               <l>There's not one Slander in his modest Play:</l>
               <l>He brings before your Eyes a modern Story,</l>
               <l>Yet meddles not with either <hi>Whig,</hi> or <hi>Tory.</hi>

               <l>Good Sanguine Men, who mind no State Affair,</l>

               <l>But in your Parties, why should we engage,</l>
               <l>Or meddle with the Plots of a mad Age?</l>
               <l>We lose enough by those upon the Stage.</l>

               <l>'Tis not enough if but One Side's his Friend;</l>

               <l>What I by Sycophants Advice have done,</l>
               <l>I will be Absolute, and Reign alone:</l>
               <l>For where's a Statesman fam'd for just and wise;</l>
               <l>But makes our Failings, still, his aim to Rise?</l>
               <l>If Subjects thus their Monarchs Wills restrain;</l>
               <l>'Tis they are Kings; for them we idly Reign:</l>
               <l>Then I'le first break the Yoak; this Maxim still</l>
               <l>shall be my Guide <hi>(A Prince can do no Ill!)</hi>
               </l>
               <l>In spite of Slaves, his Genius let him trust;</l>
               <l>For Heav'n n'ere made a King, but made him just.</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>WEll, Sirs!-Your kind Opinion now, I pray,</l>
               <l>Of this our neither <hi>Whig</hi> nor <hi>Tory-</hi>Play;</l>
               <l>To blow such Coales our Conscious Muse denies;</l>
               <l>Wit, Sacred Wit, such Subjects should despise.</l>
               <l>The Author saies his <hi>Heliconian</hi> stream,</l>
               <l>Is not yet drain'd to such a low extream.</l>
               <l>To abuse one Party with a Cursed Play,</l>
               <l>And Bribe the other for a large third Day.</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Gladiators</hi> then, you streight resort;</l>
               <l>And Crowd to make your <hi>Nero-</hi>Faction sport.</l>
               <l>But what's more strange, that Men of sense shou'd do it!</l>
               <l>For Worrying one another, Pay the Poet:</l>
               <l>So <hi>Butchers</hi> at a Baiting, take delight,</l>
               <l>For him that keeps the <hi>Bears,</hi> to Roar and Fight;</l>
               <l>Both Friends and Foes, such Authors make their Game,</l>
               <l>Who have your Money, that was all their Ayme:</l>
               <l>No matter for the Play, nor for their Wit;</l>
               <l>The better Farce is Acted in the Pit.</l>
               <l>Both Parties to be cheated, well agree;</l>
               <l>And swallow any Nonsense, so it be</l>
               <l>With Faction fac'd, and guilt with Loyalty.</l>
               <l>Here's such a Rout with Whigging and with Torying,</l>
               <l>That you neglect your dear-lov'd sin of Whoring:</l>
               <l>The Visor-mask, that ventur'd her Half-Crown,</l>
               <l>Finding no hopes but here to be undone;</l>
               <l>Like a Cast Mistress, past her dear-delight,</l>
               <l>Turns Godly streight, and goes to Church in spite;</l>
               <l>And does not doubt, since you are grown so fickle,</l>
               <l>To find more Cullies in a Conventicle.</l>
               <l>We on the Stage stand still, and are content,</l>
               <l>To see you Act what we should Represent.</l>
               <l>You use us like the Women that you Woe;</l>
               <l>You make us sport, and Pay us for it too.</l>
               <l>Well, w'are resolv'd that in our next Play-Bill,</l>
               <l>To Print at large a Tryal of your skill;</l>
               <l>And that five hundred Monsters are to fight,</l>
               <l>Then more will run to see so strange a sight,</l>
               <l>Than the <hi>Morocco,</hi> or the <hi>Muscovite.</hi>
               </l>
