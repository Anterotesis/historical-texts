         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Publiſhing of theſe Firſt Eſſays of <hi>Natural Experiments,</hi> which for many Years have been made in our <hi>Academy,</hi> under the Protection, and with the Indefatigable Aſſiſtance of the moſt Serene Prince <hi>Leopold</hi> your Highneſs's Brother, will prove the happy occaſion of giving freſh Teſtimonies (of your Highneſs's great Liberality) to all thoſe parts of the World where Vertue is adorn'd with its deſerved Luſtre; and will create a new ſenſe of Gratitude and Reſpect in all true Lovers of the more curious Arts, and Nobler Sciences. Eſpecially we ought to frame our thoughts to a more humble Acknowledgment, as we are more nearly concerned and warmed by the cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:95319:6"/>
Rays, and invigorating Influence of your Highneſs's bounty. Which with the favour of your Patronage, the incouraging invitation of your Mind, and proper Genius that way; but above all, with the Honour of your Preſence, ſometimes ſtooping to our <hi>Academy,</hi> ſometimes commanding us to your Royal Apartments, has beſtowed upon it an Immortal Name; Kindled Active Deſires in our Breaſts, and given an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py encreaſe to our Studies. Theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons eaſily demonſtrate, with what duty we are engaged to Conſecrate the firſt Fruits of our Labours to your Highneſs's moſt Illuſtrious Name; ſince nothing can proceed from us, wherein you can have a greater ſhare, and by conſequence more due to you; nor any thing that may make fairer approaches to merit the happy Fate of your generous Acceptance. 'Tis certain, that through the Exceſs of ſo large and ſignal Favours, we can be ſenſible of no greater Reſentments than to find our ſelves ſo much obliged to your Highneſs: not that we refuſe to bear the Weight of ſo endearing and ineſtimable an Obligation; but onely becauſe we would wiſh to be able to offer ſomething not

purely your own; whence we might at leaſt flatter our ſelves, That we had made ſome ſmall return which your Highneſs might impute in ſome degree to our choice, and not wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewable to your Highneſs Self, or Neceſſity· But we muſt reſt ſatisfied with the bare deſire of ſo juſt and deſerved a Paſſion; ſince theſe new <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Speculations are ſo deeply Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in your Highneſs's Protection, that not onely what is now produced by our <hi>Academy,</hi> but what ever ſhall be brought to Maturity in the moſt Famous Schools of <hi>Europe,</hi> or After Ages raiſe up, ſhall be likewiſe due to your Highneſs, as the gift of your Beneficence: ſince as long as the <hi>Sun, Planets,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> retain their glory, and <hi>Heaven</hi> endures, there will remain a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Memory of one that contributes ſo much with his auſpicious Influence to ſuch new and ſtrange Diſcoveries; opening an unbeaten Path for the leaſt fallacious Method of ſearch after Truth. Yet in ſo great a ſcarcity of Tributes, ſome little thing preſents it ſelf to manifeſt our grateful obſervance; which is the onely joy wherewith we ſupport our Deficiency, while all redounds in more reſplendant Glory to your
<pb facs="tcp:95319:7"/>
Highneſs, who having already acted your full Proportion of what ever new, good, and great, is at any time to be found in the Repoſitory of Sciences, has enervated and diſcouraged all thoughts of emulation in others. This, and this alone are we able to lay at your Highneſs Feet, whoſe continual Protection we crave with Reſpect and Reverence, begging from Heaven the height of Proſperity and Grandure to your Highneſs.</p>

            <p>AMong all the Creatures of Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Birthright doubtleſs belongs to the <hi>Idea</hi> of Truth, which the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Artificer ſo exactly followed in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Fabrick of Nature, That no <hi>Being</hi> was made with the leaſt irregular Bias of falſhood: But Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, (in the Contemplation of ſo high and perfect a Structure, through an extravagant deſire of Comprehending the admirable Deſign, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out all the Meaſures and Proportions of ſo Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful an Order) when he aims to penetrate too deep into the Truth, frames to himſelf an indefinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of falſities, which proceeds from no other cauſe but his Ambition to take thoſe Wings Nature never

deſign'd (perchance fearing to be ſome time or other diſcovered by him unwillingly in the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her greater Works;) yet upon theſe he begins to raiſe himſelf, and tho charged with the weight of a Material Body, ſtretches forth theſe Pinions to ſoar higher than the Scale of Senſe leads, and fixes himſelf upon that Light, whoſe Rays, too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful for his Eyes dazle, and blind him. Thus we ſee from Mans Raſhneſs, the firſt Seeds of falſe Notions came; from which yet it happens, not that the bright Splendor of Gods Excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is at all ſhaded, or by their Commerce with them in the leaſt vitiated: ſince all theſe Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be Attributed to Mans Ignorance, vitiated whence they had their Beginnings; when impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applying the Cauſes to the Effects, he takes not from either the verity of their Beings, but onely delineates in his own mind a falſe Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Relation to each other, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not that the ſoveraign Beneficence of God when he Creates our Souls, denies them to pry, as we may ſay for a Moment into the Immenſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Eternal Wiſdom; adorning them as with the moſt precious <hi>Jewels,</hi> with ſome firſt Sparks of
<pb facs="tcp:95319:8"/>
Truth, ſufficiently evident from their retaining Notions not to be acquired here, whence we muſt conclude, They received them from ſome other Place.</p>
            <p>But it happens through our Misfortune, that theſe rare Gems, as they are but loofly ſet in the Mind, yet too tender when ſhe firſt falls into her Earthly Habitation, and wraps her ſelf in this Clay; ſo for a time they fall out of their Collets, are ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed, and worth nothing till by aſſiduous and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Study, they are again reſet in their proper places. This is what the Mind attempts in the ſearch of Nature; wherefore we muſt Confeſs, we have no better means then <hi>Geometry,</hi> which at firſt Eſſay hits the Truth, and frees at once from all doubts, and wearying Reſearches. And indeed ſhe leads into the way of <hi>Philoſophical Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> but at laſt leaves us; not that <hi>Geometry</hi> has not a large Field to expatiate in, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels not over all Natures Works; as they all ſubmit to thoſe <hi>Mathematick Laws,</hi> by which the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Decree freely Rules, and Commands them; but becauſe we hitherto are unable to follow her in ſo long, and wide a Path onely a few ſteps. Now
<pb facs="tcp:95319:9"/>
where we may not truſt our ſelves to go farther, we can relye on nothing with greater Aſſurance than the faith of Experience, which (like one that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeveral looſe and ſcattered <hi>Gems,</hi> endeavours to fix each in its proper Collet) by Adapting the Effects to the Cauſes; and again the Cauſes to the Effects if not at firſt Eſſay, as <hi>Geometry</hi> yet at laſt ſucceeds ſo happily,<note place="margin">Provan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. e Ripro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vand<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We ought then to proceed with much Circumſpection, leſt too great a relyance and truſt in Experience, turn us out of the way, and impoſe upon us; ſince it ſometimes falls out, that before the clear Truth appears to us, when the firſt more open Vailes of Deceit are taken off, we diſcover ſome cheating Appearances that indeed have ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Reſemblance of Truth: and theſe are the imperfect Lineaments that are ſeen through the laſt coverings that more nearly vail the lovely face of Truth; through the fine Web whereof ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeems ſo plain and lively, that ſome might conclude, She was Nakedly Diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Here then we ought to carry our ſelves as Maſter-workmen, to diſcern between Truth and Error, and
<pb facs="tcp:95319:9"/>
the utmoſt perſpicacy of Judgment is but requiſite, to ſee well what really is, from what is not; And to be the better able to perform this Task, doubtleſs 'tis neceſſary to have at ſome time or other ſeen Truth unvailed; an Advantage they onely have; who have had ſome taſte of the ſtudies of <hi>Geometry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it of leſs uſe to ſearch among <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> already made, than to attempt New ones, if haply any may be found, that have at all diſguiſed the ſimple Face of Truth: wherefore 'tis aimed at in our <hi>Academy,</hi> beſides what has been Invented by us, to try alſo (either for Curioſity, or as we light upon them by chance) thoſe things which have been already done, or wrote off by others: obſerving too well, That under this Name of <hi>Experiments,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Errors</hi> have crept in, and been entertained.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt Motive to the perſpicacious and indefatigable Mind of the moſt Serene Prince <hi>Leopold</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> who in the Receſs of thoſe daily Negotiations, and ſolicitous Cares that attend his High Quality, diverted into the rough Path of the Nobleſt <hi>Sciences.</hi> But his Highneſs's diſcerning Judgment eaſily foreſeeing that the Reputation of great <hi>Authors</hi> proves too often hurtful to the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
<pb facs="tcp:95319:10"/>
who through too much Confidence, and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Names, fear to call in queſtion what is delivered upon their Authority; wherefore he judges it an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking worthy of his great Mind to confront with the moſt Acurate, and ſenſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, the force of their Aſſertions, and with the due rejection of Errors, and Embraceing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities, to make ſo deſirable, and ineſtimable a Preſent to thoſe that earneſtly wiſh for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Truth. Theſe prudent Inſtructions of our moſt Serene <hi>Patron,</hi> received with due Reverence and Reſpect by our <hi>Academy,</hi> has not moved us to be indiſcreet Cenſurers of the Learned Pains of others, nor made us bold Obtruders of our own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents for Truths, and diſcoveries of Abuſes: but it is our Principal Intent to incite others alſo to repeat with the greateſt ſeverity, and niceneſs, the ſame Experiments; as we have now adventured to do with thoſe of any other Perſon: Tho in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing theſe firſt Eſſays, we have, what we could abſtained therefrom, that we might by this due reſpect, gain upon the Adverſary to believe the ſincerity of our Impartial, and Reſpectful Thoughts. And to the full compleating of ſo generous and
<pb facs="tcp:95319:10"/>
uſeful an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, we deſire onely a free Correſpondence with thoſe ſeveral Societies that are diſperced throughout the more Illuſtrious, and Noted Parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> That with the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of attaining ſuch high Ends, ſo profitable a Commerce being in all parts round about promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we may all go on with equal freedom, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring as much as poſſible, and participating of the Truth: and for our parts, we will concur to this Work with the greateſt ſimplicity, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity; whereof 'tis no ſmall Argument, That when we have related the Experiments of others, we have ſtill mentioned the <hi>Authors</hi> Name, when known to us; and that we have often freely confeſſed, that ſuppoſition concerning ſome <hi>Experiments,</hi> which when put in practice we were never ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful as to bring to Perfection. But above all, to prove clearly the unfeigned ſincerity of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure, let that Freedom ſuffice, wherewith we have ſtill communicated the <hi>Eſſays</hi> and <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> themſelves to any that, Travelling by our Country, ſhewed any deſire, or reliſh of ſuch <hi>Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> moved either by a gentile Humor, Eſteem of Learning, or Spur of Curioſity; and that from
<pb facs="tcp:95319:11"/>
the firſt time our <hi>Academy</hi> was Founded in the Year <hi>1657,</hi> when the greateſt part, if not all the <hi>Experiments</hi> were invented, whereof theſe <hi>Eſſays</hi> are now Publiſhed. If it ſhall happen, that among them there ſhall be any found, thought of before, or after the time they were made here by other Perſons, and made Publick, let us not be blamed for it, ſince we could neither know, nor ſee all things; ſo that no man ought to wonder at the lucky Accord of our Minds, and Inventions with other Mens; nor indeed will we, if we find thoſe of other Men agree with ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We are unwilling any ſhould imagine, That we pretend in this Publication, a Perfect Work; or in the leaſt, an Exact Module of a large <hi>Experimental Hiſtory;</hi> conſcious to our ſelves, that more Time, and greater Abilities are neceſſary to ſo vaſt a Deſign; as may be ſeen by the very <hi>Title</hi> we have prefix'd, onely of <hi>Eſſays,</hi> which we had never put forth, had we not been much urged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by Perſons Meriting from us, by their dear importunities, the Sacrifice of a Bluſh, for expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch imperfect <hi>Embrio's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we will cloſe all with a Proteſtation,
<pb facs="tcp:95319:11"/>
That we never deſire to entertain Controverſie with any, or engage in any Nice Diſputation, or heat of Contradiction; and if ſometimes, as a Tranſition from one <hi>Experiment</hi> to another, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what occaſion ſoever, there ſhall be inſerted any hints of Speculation, we Requeſt they may be taken always for the thoughts, and particular ſenſe of ſome one of the Members, but not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the whole <hi>Academy,</hi> whoſe ſole Deſign is to make <hi>Experiments,</hi> and Relate them. For ſuch was our firſt Propoſal, and the Intent of that great Perſonage, who with his Particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and far-reaching Judgment, cauſed us to take that Method; to which Sage, and Prudent Advice we have ſtill punctually, and regularly conformed.</p>

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis hard, if not altogether impoſſible to evacuate the Ball of all the <hi>Air</hi> by Rarefaction; and the Ball will want ſo much of being fill'd as there was <hi>Air</hi> left in it; we may thus quite fill it with a Glaſs Funnel, having a very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhank, which may eaſily be made when the Glaſs is red hot, and ready to run; for then it may be drawn into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſmall hollow Threads, as is well known to thoſe that work in Glaſs. Put the ſmall ſhank of this Funnel into the Cane to be fill'd, and by forcing the Spirit of Wine through the Funnel with ones Breath, or ſucking it back again when there is too much; you may fill the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> up to what mark in the Neck you pleaſe. The next thing is to divide the Neck of the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> or <hi>Tube</hi> into Degrees exactly; therefore firſt, divide the whole <hi>Tube</hi> into Ten equal Parts with Compaſſes, marking each of them with a knob of white <hi>Enamel,</hi>

               <p>We rather make uſe of <hi>Spirits,</hi> than ſimple Spring Water for theſe <hi>Inſtruments</hi>; becauſe, firſt 'tis colder, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) ſooner ſenſible of the leaſt change of Heat and Cold, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its extream lightneſs, it more readily contracts it ſelf, quickly falling or riſing. Secondly, Simple Water, how pure and clear ſoever, yet in a little time lets fall ſome Sediment, or Dregs, which ſticking to the ſides of the Veſſel, at laſt clouds its Tranſparency: whereas the higheſt rectified Spirit of Wine, or the like burning Spirits, always keep Pellucid,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95319:16"/>
nor ever abate of their firſt Beauty. And ſince it is ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>Criſtaline,</hi> that at firſt view 'tis hard to diſcern the bounds between it, and the void ſpace of the Neck of the Veſſel; we ſometimes uſed to tinge it with the Infuſion of <hi>Kermes,</hi> or <hi>Sanguis Draconis</hi>; But when we obſerved, that how light and Refined ſoever the Tincture was, yet in time ſomething ſtill adhered to the ſides of the Glaſs, and augmented rather then leſſened the Difficulty, we at laſt wholly omitted the uſe of coloured Liquors; the other being diſcernable with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtraining the Eyes.

               <p>To make it, you muſt fill a glaſs Veſſel with Rectifyed Spirits of Wine, and immerſing a <hi>Thermometer</hi> of 100 <hi>deg.</hi> therein, place it in Snow or Ice to cool it; you muſt alſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95319:17"/>
put into the ſame Liquor many little glaſs <hi>bubbles</hi> blown, and <hi>Hermetically</hi> Sealed at a Lamp; theſe by reaſon of the <hi>Air</hi> contained in them, will keep themſelves floating upon the Surface of the Water; and if by chance any one being a little heavier in <hi>Specie</hi> than Water, ſhall ſink to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; take it out, and upon a plate of Lead, with fine <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> grind off ſo much of the end as will make it light enough to ſwim.

So by little and little, as the Liquor grows warmer, and by Rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lighter, the Balls (which at a more intenſe degree of Cold kept juſt upon the Surface) ſhall begin to dive toward the bottom, and at the ſame time the Spirit of Wine in the <hi>Thermometer</hi> ſhall creep up. That Bubble or Ball thereof which ſinks when the <hi>Thermometer</hi> is at 20 <hi>deg.</hi> ſhall be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd the <hi>firſt,</hi> that is, the heavieſt, becauſe it deſcended when the Water was yet very cold, and little, or not at all altered.

               <p>WE need not go far to ſeek an Experiment, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a true and exact <hi>meaſure</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> ſuch as that by <hi>Swings,</hi> and <hi>Sounds,</hi> or <hi>Stroaks</hi>; ſince the foregoing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment is a ſufficient inſtance, where a Compariſon is made of the <hi>Humidity</hi> of <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>Winds,</hi> to find the <hi>Difference</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> of Moiſture which in equal Spaces of <hi>Time</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtills from divers <hi>Airs,</hi> by means of a Glaſs Veſſel fill'd with Ice: Which Difference conſiſts ſometimes in ſo ſmall, and ſcarce perceivable <hi>Minutie,</hi> that the Juſtneſs of the moſt Acurate <hi>Clocks</hi> cannot diſcover it, becauſe we either count the time from <hi>Stroke to Stroke,</hi> and the <hi>Ears</hi> may poſſibly be deceived; or we take it from the Spaces ſhewn by the Hand, and then much more eaſily may the <hi>Eyes</hi> commit an Error; we muſt therefore of neceſſity have recourſe to an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> that may be a more exact <hi>Time meter,</hi> than the <hi>ſound</hi> of four Strokes of the <hi>Clock,</hi> or the Minutes ſhewn by the <hi>Hand</hi> can be, in which the Judgment of the Senſes is ſo ſubject to miſtake. For (to paſs by the Errors that may be committed in the dividing of a <hi>Clock,</hi> or other material <hi>Inſtruments</hi>) it is very difficult to diſtinguiſh, whether the <hi>Hand</hi> is juſt upon the Point marked, or not. And then of <hi>Sounds,</hi> we muſt when all is done conclude, That the <hi>time</hi> is already paſt, before the <hi>Clock</hi> has done ſtriking.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, we take the <hi>Pendulum</hi> or <hi>Puppet,</hi> to be the moſt exact Inſtrument; the <hi>Swing</hi> and <hi>Return</hi> of which, being taken for one <hi>Vibration,</hi> we never knew that in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95319:19"/>
Number of many <hi>Vibrations</hi> one failure has happened, (a thing which ſeldom ſucceeds ſo well in <hi>Practiſe</hi>) nor the leaſt Variation able to cauſe an Error worth the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but becauſe the uſual <hi>Pendulum</hi> hanging by a ſingle Thread in that free Liberty of ſwinging (whatever is the reaſon thereof) in time deviates from its firſt <hi>direction,</hi> and towards the end when it approaches <hi>Reſt,</hi> its Motion is no longer in a <hi>vertical Arch,</hi> but in an <hi>Oval Spiral,</hi> in which we cannot diſtinguiſh, nor number the <hi>Vibrations</hi>; wherefore to keep the Motion true to the ſame <hi>Path,</hi> we hang the <hi>Weight</hi> in a double thread, faſtning each end thereof by it ſelf at a little diſtance to an Arm of <hi>Metal,</hi> as in the Figure. <hi>6.</hi> So the Ball or Weight being hung on this Thread by a ſmall Ring or Staple, moves in the Figure of an <hi>Iſoſceles</hi> Triangle; for ſince it hangs free upon the Thread, (though at the firſt impulſe of Motion the Figure may be rather a <hi>Scalne</hi>) yet by its weight, it ſlides down to the loweſt part to which it can fall, and keeps it ſelf fixt there: from this <hi>Triangle</hi> it comes, that the Motion of the <hi>Pendulum</hi> is regulated, while the Threads that make the legs of the <hi>Triangle</hi> (if we may uſe that ſimilitude) ſerve to ſtay the Ball from ſwerving more to one hand, than the other, and keep it always directly in the ſame <hi>Path.</hi> Since all Experiments wherein the <hi>Pendulum</hi> is made uſe of, require not the ſame diviſion of Time, a groſſer ſufficing for ſome, ſuch as is made by longer <hi>vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>: and others again asking a Diviſion ſo nice, given by <hi>vibrations</hi> ſo quick one upon another, that the <hi>Eye</hi> can ſcarce diſtinguiſh them; to be able with expedition and facility to lengthen or ſhorten the <hi>Triangle</hi> without every time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying the Thread; let there be added below the <hi>upper,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arm of <hi>Metal</hi> alſo, filled with a ſquare hole on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right piece of the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> ſo that it may ſlip up and down upon it, and be fixt at any height by a <hi>Screw</hi> on the back: this arm is cut through the midſt, which ſlit being opened, and cloſed together by the means of Two other <hi>Screws,</hi> ſtops and holds faſt the Legs of the greater <hi>Triangle</hi> at any deſired <hi>ſpace</hi> between the Ball, and the upper arm,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95319:20"/>
the lower part remaining at liberty; while that part between the two Arms is immovable: by this means the leſſer <hi>Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> below the ſtop at the ſlit which is its Baſe, <hi>vibrates</hi> freely, and ſo much the ſwifter as the Ball is ſuſpended ſhorter, and by conſequence the Legs of the <hi>Triangle</hi> more contracted.</p>
               <p>To interpoſe here a word or two; <hi>Experience</hi> tells us, (as <hi>Galileo</hi> has already obſerved next the obſervation which he firſt made, of the very near equality of Swings, about the Year 1583.) that not all the <hi>Vibrations</hi> of the <hi>Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> fall preciſely in <hi>equal ſpaces,</hi> but as they approach nearer to <hi>reſt,</hi> ſo they diſpatch themſelves in <hi>leſſer ſpaces of time</hi> than at firſt, as may be ſhewn in its place. Wherefore in thoſe Experiments that require a greater acuracy, and ſo long a time of obſervation, that the little inequalities of theſe <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations</hi> in a great number of them may at laſt happen to be ſenſible, 'twas thought good to apply the <hi>Pendulum</hi> to the Movement of the <hi>Clock</hi>: a thing which <hi>Galileo</hi> firſt Invented, and his Son <hi>Vincenzio Galilei</hi> put in practice in 1649. So the <hi>Pendulum</hi> is moved by the force of the <hi>Spring,</hi> or <hi>Weight,</hi> and ſtill carryed to the ſame height each way, with this great benefit, that not onely the length of the <hi>Vibrations</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exactly <hi>equal,</hi> but in a manner all the <hi>Defects</hi> in the other parts of the <hi>Clock</hi> are corrected and regulated. That we might be able to make uſe of ſuch an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Experiments (which require the time, ſome more, ſome leſs ſubtilly divided) we made divers Balls of <hi>Metal</hi> faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſmall <hi>Iron</hi> Wires, of different lengths, each to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into the ſame <hi>female Screw</hi> when deſired: of theſe the ſhorteſt made its whole <hi>Vibration,</hi> in half a <hi>Second</hi> Minute of an Hour, the ſhorteſt needful; all other returns of ſhorter <hi>Vibrattons</hi> being ſo ſwift, that the <hi>Eye</hi> is ſcarce able to follow them.</p>

               <p>THat famous Experiment of the <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> is now ſpread throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> which firſt in the Year 1643. offered it ſelf to the thoughts of the Ingenious <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricelli</hi>; nor is the noble and curious inference he makes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from leſs enquired after, and known, when he comes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the <hi>cauſe</hi> of that ſtrange <hi>Effect</hi>; for he propoſeth, that it is the <hi>Air</hi> preſſing upon all Bodies under it, forces them, and removes them out of their places, when ever there is a <hi>void</hi> and <hi>empty ſpace</hi> whereto they may retire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves; and particularly <hi>fluids,</hi> from their great tendency to <hi>Motion</hi>: whereas <hi>ſolid</hi> Bodies, as Gravel, and Sand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or pieces of greater Stones (when there is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to move them) are rather joyned, and preſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the cloſer by that means, from the roughneſs and irregularity of their parts, ſo locking the whole Maſs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they ſuſtain and prop up one another, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt more powerfully any <hi>force</hi> applyed to move them: but on the contrary, <hi>Liquid</hi> Bodies, it may be from the ſmoothneſs or roundneſs of their Particles from ſome other <hi>Figure</hi> they are of, are eaſily moved, their parts ſtanding as it were in <hi>aequilibrio</hi> upon a Point, that as ſoon as ever they are preſſed, they yield every way, and ſpread themſelves, as we ſee <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> from the leaſt <hi>Body</hi> that falls thereon, breaks away on all ſides in orderly <hi>Circles:</hi> and who knows, that from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherence and looſneſs of the parts, it may not happen that 'tis ſeldom or never ſtable, though in its moſt <hi>proper recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> where it ſeems ſometimes Stagnant ſo that the ſmalleſt breath of Wind curls and agitates it; and even in ſtanding Lakes and Pools, where it ſeems moſt Sedate, though the Eye perceives it not, yet there the <hi>Water</hi> is in perpetual

                  <hi>Motion,</hi> and obedient to all the <hi>undulations</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> which it may be is never at <hi>Reſt</hi>; nor is this more peculiar to <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> than any other <hi>Liquid</hi>; in all which, as ſome think, the force of the <hi>Airs Preſſure</hi> is very evident; eſpecially, when they are in a place which in any one part of its <hi>Superficies</hi> has a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or as it were void ſpace into which the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid</hi> may retire: for the Contiguous Air preſſing the Fluid on the one part with ſo many Miles height, when on the other part (contiguous to the <hi>Vacuity</hi>) it touches not, nor can gravitate at all; it muſt neceſſarily mount it into that void ſpace, till the raiſed fluid becomes an <hi>Equipoize</hi> to the <hi>Airs Preſſure</hi> on the other part. This <hi>Equilibrium</hi> with divers <hi>Fluids,</hi> is at divers Heights, as they are more or leſs heavy in <hi>Specie</hi>; a leſſer or greater quantity of which is able to reſiſt the Force and Weight of the <hi>Air.</hi> We (following the common Practice, as likewiſe the firſt Inventer <hi>Torricelli</hi>) make uſe of <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> which being very heavy, is much more commodious for the Experiment, making a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in a far leſs ſpace than any other <hi>Liquid</hi> can.

               <p>Taking the ſame Veſſel AB, with its Cane EF (before we poured off any of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> as was directed in the former Experiment, or ſtopt up the Mouth of the Veſſel at A with Cement) and then ſetting all in a great Veſſel full of <hi>Water</hi> KLMN, the <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> was obſerved to be ſenſibly depreſt from A to GH; and on the contrary, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Cane from I to O; this Aſcent being about the <hi>fourteenth</hi> part of the whole height of the <hi>Water</hi> EF: then the Mouth A was cloſed, that ſo onely the <hi>Water</hi> in the ſpace AGH might preſs upon the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs loſt none of the height lately gained by the weight

The ſame may be ſaid to happen to the <hi>Air.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Some deſirous to ſee what Effect a greater, or leſſer Rarefaction of the <hi>Air</hi> included in AGH would have, made this Trial.</p>
               <p>Joyning to the Veſſel AB the Beak CD (into which they faſtned a Mouth of Metal with a <hi>female Screw</hi>), they adapted a <hi>Syringe</hi>; Then whenever a <hi>Suction</hi> was made of the <hi>Air</hi> in AGH, and ſo what remained attenuated and weakned, the Level I, might be ſeen to <hi>ſubſide,</hi> contrarily when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed more, by forcing in new <hi>Air</hi>; the ſame Level I <hi>was raiſed.</hi>

               <p>The ſame happens from <hi>Fire</hi> or <hi>Ice</hi> approaching it; for the Mouth C being cloſed, when <hi>Fire</hi> is Externally applyed to the <hi>Air</hi> in AGH, the <hi>Mercury</hi> riſes, and by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Ice ſubſides</hi>; as if after the ſame manner, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the contrary operations of the <hi>Syringe</hi>; the <hi>Air</hi> had been Condenſed, and enforced by Heat, and rarefied and weakned by Cold; from all which Matters it ſeemed probable, that this <hi>ſuſtention</hi> of the <hi>Fluid</hi> does not abſolutely depend upon the <hi>weight</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> but alſo upon the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> which <hi>lower</hi> parts of the <hi>Air</hi> receive from thoſe <hi>above.</hi>

When filled, we cover the Mouth AC with a Glaſs Cover a little Convex (<hi>Fig.</hi> 4.) and then with a Bladder bound faſt about with a waxed Thread below in the ſmall of the Neck. Put then your hands under the Ball on each ſide; and gently lifting it up, take away the Cuſhion, and Immerſe the Mouth B into the Stagnant <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Baſin: looſen the Knot of the Ligature at B, and the <hi>Mercury</hi> by its weight falling, will open it, and make a <hi>Vacuum.</hi>

               <p>But when we would incloſe Fiſh therein, we leave no <hi>air,</hi> nor do we fill the whole Ball with <hi>Mercury,</hi> but pour in ſo much Water, as when the <hi>vacuum,</hi> is made, and the <hi>Mercury</hi> ſunk down into the <hi>Cilinder,</hi> the Water ſwimming thereon may fill about half the Ball, that the Fiſhes may move, and bear themſelves thereon.</p>

And when we already had this before us, we attempted to draw thence ſome other Concluſions; as will appear in the following <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>

               <head>The Firſt <hi>Experiment.</hi> Of the Freezing of common <hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Air.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is already declared, in the foregoing <hi>Experiments,</hi> that the <hi>Artificial Ice</hi> (in the then deſcribed Veſſels) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a <hi>beginning</hi> very <hi>ſoft,</hi> and <hi>incompact</hi>; eſpecially, in regard of thoſe made in the <hi>Winter air</hi>; which, tho they are not ſo ſuddenly made, but begin from a thin <hi>coat,</hi> or hair-like <hi>Vein,</hi> ſcarce diſcernable; yet thoſe <hi>Veins,</hi> or <hi>Coats</hi> (excepting their <hi>brittleneſs,</hi> which comes from their being
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95319:77"/>
ſo very ſmall) are more firm, and hard Bodies, and as it were more <hi>Criſtaline,</hi> and Solid <hi>Ice.</hi> And very admirable is that <hi>Luſus Naturae</hi> which for many years we have obſerv'd in <hi>Natural Freezings,</hi> viz. Setting Water taken out of the ſame <hi>Spring</hi> in ſeveral Veſſels, as of <hi>Earth,</hi> of <hi>Metal,</hi> and of <hi>Glaſs</hi>; in the ſhape of tall <hi>Glaſſes,</hi> or broad <hi>Bowles,</hi> ſome part-filled, ſome quite-fill'd; ſome open, others covered, and in ſeveral ſorts of <hi>bottles,</hi> with different Mouths; ſome onely ſtop'd with <hi>Cotton,</hi> others ſealed at a <hi>Flame,</hi> being all ſet in the ſame place undiſturbed, or beſide one another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Table: ſometimes that Veſſel which had leaſt, was firſt <hi>Frozen</hi>; ſometimes that which had moſt, and ſo in all the Veſſels, without any regard had of the <hi>form,</hi> or <hi>fullneſs</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Materials,</hi> we may poſitively aver, That <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Veſſels</hi> freeze the contained <hi>Fluid</hi> ſooner than either <hi>Metal,</hi> or <hi>Glaſs.</hi> But as to the reſt, we have found nothing ſo conſtant, as the <hi>perpetual irregularity</hi> of the <hi>Accidents</hi>; and among others, there have ſome Veſſels ſtood all <hi>Night</hi> without the leaſt Coat of <hi>Ice,</hi> when ſome next to them have been <hi>frozen</hi> in an <hi>hour.</hi> Moreover, in the ſame ſort of Veſſels ſet to <hi>freeze,</hi> in the ſame <hi>Night,</hi> we have obſerved the like <hi>varieties,</hi> whether placed <hi>North, South, Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt</hi>; and as well thoſe Veſſels which have ſtood more <hi>Southwardly</hi> have been <hi>frozen</hi> firſt, as at other times, thoſe that ſtood more <hi>Northwardly,</hi> tho the <hi>Cold</hi> generally comes from that Tract with us: and ſometimes thoſe <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> ſometimes thoſe <hi>Weſtward</hi> have got the better; nay ſometimes both have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> and at other times been van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Method</hi> alſo obſerved in <hi>Freezing,</hi> is very curious: The <hi>water</hi> begins firſt to congeal at the <hi>top</hi> round the <hi>edges,</hi> and from that Liſt of <hi>Ice</hi> ſhoots ſeveral ſmall <hi>Threads</hi> to the <hi>middle,</hi> after which it ſends others downwards, and that indifferently from all parts; by degrees theſe <hi>Threads</hi> became ragged, yet <hi>thicker,</hi> and <hi>broader</hi> at one end, and more <hi>acute</hi> at the other, like little <hi>Daggers</hi>; from the ſides of

whence the <hi>Floaters</hi> upon the top of the <hi>water</hi> upon the leaſt breath of warmth ſunk down, and thoſe at the bottom, upon any acceſſion of <hi>Cold,</hi> mounted upwards: hanging this <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in the <hi>air,</hi> and ſuffering the <hi>bubbles</hi> to reſt, we began to approach to it underneath a <hi>pan</hi> of Water <hi>heated,</hi> and after that of <hi>Cold</hi> Water mix'd with <hi>Ice</hi> well broken; And though upon the <hi>application</hi> of theſe different Ambients, we obſerved the ſame <hi>Effects</hi> in the <hi>Level,</hi> of raiſing it ſelf upon the touch of the <hi>Cold,</hi> and ſubſiding upon that of the <hi>hot</hi> Water; yet we could not find, when the water ſeemed condenſed, and contracted, that any of them at the <hi>bottom</hi> roſe up, nor when the Water ſeemed rarefied, and enlarged, any of the <hi>Floaters</hi> ſunk to the <hi>bottom:</hi> but <hi>theſe</hi> were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to <hi>fall,</hi> and thoſe to <hi>riſe,</hi> when the Water after its abatement upon the firſt impreſſion of <hi>heat,</hi> began to riſe again, and when after its riſing upon the impreſſion of <hi>Cold</hi> it began to ſubſide again: an <hi>argument</hi> to inſinuate, that, the <hi>water,</hi> and ſo any other <hi>Fluids</hi> in this firſt Motion, do not really move themſelves, but onely obey the <hi>alteration</hi> of the Veſſels they are contained in.</p>
               <p>Yet it may be <hi>objected,</hi> That theſe firſt <hi>alterations</hi> did really proceed from the inward changes of the <hi>Liquors,</hi> which tho diſcernable by the <hi>Eye,</hi> by means of the ſmall Neck of the <hi>veſſel,</hi> yet were not great enough to be diſcerned in changing the <hi>aequilibrium</hi> of the <hi>Bubbles</hi>; of which it may be thought, that, in <hi>that</hi> very inſtant, they began really to move, though in their firſt parting from <hi>Reſt,</hi> the Eye could not perceive it.</p>
               <p>To this is <hi>anſwered,</hi> That, the true <hi>Rarifaction,</hi> and the true <hi>Condenſation</hi> of the Water (that is able to make it <hi>riſe</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> ſo very little a ſpace as it does <hi>riſe</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> at the entrance into the <hi>Icey</hi> mixtture, or <hi>hot</hi> Water,) is ſufficient to alter the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> alſo between it, and the <hi>bubbles,</hi> apparently to the <hi>Eye.</hi> And indeed, when the Water really <hi>riſes</hi> or <hi>falls</hi> from a true <hi>Rarifaction</hi> or <hi>Condenſation,</hi> the <hi>bubbles</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe begin correſpondently to move, before ever it comes to the ſame Degree, at which (the ſame <hi>bubbles</hi> remaining im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable)

               <hi>Electricity</hi> to no <hi>Subſtances,</hi> that after a due <hi>Friction</hi> did not attract thoſe light <hi>Corpuſcles</hi> at ſome ſmall <hi>diſtance,</hi> which we onely found done by the above named.</p>
            <p>We have alſo Noted, That whatever <hi>External</hi> accidents alters <hi>Amber</hi> (whether by <hi>heating,</hi> or <hi>freezing,</hi> or <hi>wetting</hi> with any Liquor) the ſame has the like Effect upon <hi>Gems,</hi> and all other <hi>Electrick</hi> Bodies: yet indeed it is more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in <hi>Amber,</hi> as it is impregnated with a greater Virtue: wherefore omiting all others, we will here onely treat of that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amber</hi> then, of all ſorts of Bodies preſented to it, refuſes onely to draw <hi>Flame</hi>; altho <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Saggina. Baſſilico.</note> That it does not attract any thing ſteeped in <hi>Oyl,</hi> and <hi>Greaſe</hi>; or as ſome ſay, <hi>Baſilicon,</hi> which we found a miſtake: yet <hi>Smoke</hi> is attracted; and it is very curious to obſerve, how by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a piece of <hi>Amber</hi> rubbed hot, to the <hi>ſmoak</hi> of a Candle blown out, it will preſently bend, and wave towards the <hi>Amber</hi>; part of it will be arreſted by the <hi>Amber</hi>; and part, as if reflected from a <hi>Glaſs,</hi> will mount upwards, while that which remains, unites it ſelf like a ſmall <hi>Cloud,</hi> and as the <hi>Amber</hi> cools riſes in <hi>ſmoke</hi> again, and vaniſhes.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Flame,</hi> not onely refuſes to yield it ſelf; but if a piece of <hi>Amber,</hi> after it is well rubbed, be a little while held to it, it loſes its Virtue, and a repeated <hi>Friction</hi> is but neceſſary to make it attract; and if after it has taken up any ſmall thing, it be held to the <hi>Flame,</hi> it will immediatly let it go again.</p>
            <p>But the Heat that comes from burning Coales, is not ſo great an Enemy to the power of the <hi>Amber,</hi> it being ſometimes capable of exciting it without rubbing, and indeed by the <hi>heat</hi> received from the <hi>Fire</hi> onely, it acts faintly; but then becomes more vigorous, by adding <hi>friction</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ice</hi> alone is not prejudicial to the <hi>Amber,</hi> but when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by mingling therewith <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> it ſo quells the Virtue, that ſome time is required, as likewiſe a long and violent <hi>rubbing,</hi> to regain it. So that it has been thought,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95319:99"/>
that this ſtupifying of its <hi>force</hi> proceeds not from the <hi>increaſe</hi> of Cold in the <hi>Ice,</hi> from the ſprinkling of <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi>; but rather from ſome fine <hi>Ruſt,</hi> or hoarineſs, as it were, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the <hi>Amber,</hi> from the <hi>Salt</hi>; or rather indeed, from the imbibing the <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> which is one of the Liquors that deſtroy the <hi>Electricity</hi> of <hi>Amber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither are all matters capable to draw forth this Virtue from the <hi>Amber</hi>; for being rubbed upon Bodies of a ſmooth <hi>Superficies,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Glaſs, Criſtal, Ivory,</hi> and poliſh'd <hi>Metals,</hi> or <hi>Gems,</hi> it ſtill continues aſleep, and ſhews no ſign of Life; ſo that it needs ſome ſmall <hi>inequality</hi> and <hi>aſperity</hi> of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi>; as <hi>Cloath, Linen,</hi> and a thouſand other things have, unneceſſary to be named here: and likewiſe <hi>Human Fleſh</hi> excites this Power; but ſome more, ſome leſs: and we have known ſome, that let it be rubbed never ſo long on their hand, yet could not happen to make it attract.</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed, That <hi>Amber</hi> attracts the little Bodies to it ſelf; but the Action is indeed <hi>mutual,</hi> not more properly belonging to the <hi>Amber,</hi> than to the Bodies moved, by which alſo it ſelf is attracted; or rather, it applies it ſelf to them: of this we made the <hi>Experiment</hi>; and found, that the <hi>Amber</hi> being hung at liberty by a thread in the <hi>Air,</hi> or counterpois'd upon a Point like a <hi>Magnetical Needle</hi>; when it was rubb'd and heated, made a ſtoop to thoſe little Bodies, which likewiſe <hi>proportionally</hi> preſented themſelves thereto, and readily obey'd its call.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liquors</hi> alſo are ſenſible of this Power of the <hi>Amber</hi>; the ſmalleſt <hi>drops</hi> of which, it attracts, even thoſe of <hi>Mercury:</hi> indeed it is unable to manage them, except very <hi>minute</hi>; whence it ſoon lets them go, after they have been attracted: but when we have preſented it to the <hi>Superficies</hi> of ſtanding <hi>Liquors,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> it ſelf, it did not raiſe up one <hi>drop</hi>; but as it were, made the Level of the <hi>Superficies</hi> ſwell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; which raiſed it ſelf in a little Bubble toward it, but inverted ſo, as to reſpect it with its pointed part.
