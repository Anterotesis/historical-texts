            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Giving an Exact Relation of the Extent of that Monarch's Dominions, the Religion, Manners and Cuſtoms of the Inhabitants; their Commerce, and the Product of the Country, and likewiſe a faithful Narrative of the Kingdom of <hi>SIAM,</hi> of the Iſles of <hi>JAPAN</hi> and <hi>MADAGASCAR,</hi> and of ſeveral other Parts, with ſuch New Diſcoveries as were never yet made by any other Traveller.</p>

TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Good Reception the World afforded to the Firſt Impreſſion of the greater part of the following Sheets, has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me to ſend 'em again abroad, ina more exact dreſs, and with conſiderable Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. You will find in theſe <hi>Memoires</hi> a number of things which have eſcap'd the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance of all former Travellers. Firſt you have a Deſcription of all the Iſlands of <hi>Cape-Verd;</hi> From whence the Author Sayling to <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> where he ſtays long enough to know the Quality of the Country, and the Manners of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, whereof he gives ſo exact a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that nothing ſeems to be omitted.</p>
            <p>Then he purſues his Voyage to the Iſle of <hi>Java Major,</hi> of which, and eſpecially of the Kingdom of <hi>BANTAM,</hi> he gives ſo particular an account, that it equally ſerves to the Readers inſtruction and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; is both profitable and agreeable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108700:3"/>
What he ſays afterwards of <hi>SIAM,</hi> is no leſs uſeful and pleaſant. He relates circumſtances of that Country as were not yet known; and the Deſcription he makes of it is ſo perfect and delightful, that it is eaſie to perceive he himſelf took a ſingular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therein. I ſay nothing of <hi>Formoſa,</hi> whereof he only ſpeaks by the by, tho what he ſays thereof, teaches us that all Men are not made after the ſame manner. He ends his Voyage with a Deſcription of <hi>Nangue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaque,</hi> and of the Manners of the <hi>Japane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,</hi> whereof he gives a pretty, tho ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, knowing there have been great Volumes upon that Subject. And this Edition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect and correct, I do not queſtion but the Reader will give it even a more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable entertainment than the former; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being all along interwoven with ſuch ſurprizing Cercumſtances and Stories, as will undoubtedly render the peruſal of it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delightful; particularly at this Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, when an Ambaſſador from thoſe Countries, does make People the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of an account of this nature.</p>

               <p>THO I was Born with a deſire of Travelling, yet there was little probability, I could purſue my Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: My Father not being Rich, and alſo conſidering, I might be uſeful to him, and to the World, if I learnt an honeſt Trade, made it his buſineſs to perſwade me into an Apprentiſhip. What repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſoever I might have to that ſort of Life, I was forced to obey, at firſt indeed with much difficulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> imagining that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108700:4"/>
imploy would be an invincible hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the deſign I had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> formed of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Countries beſides my own; but afterwards with delight, when my Reaſon made me know, that what I did, was ſo far from being an obſtacle to my Inclination, as it opened me a way to the Travels which I meditated. Aſſoon as I perceived this, I was the more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and brisk at my work; I became more tractable and more aſſiduous than before. I never heard the Compaſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned without feeling an extraordinary joy; and when I ſaw Marine Cards, I could never be wear with looking on them. The paſſion of Voyaging did ſo fortifie it ſelf in me with Age, that I had hardly attain'd Seventeen Years, but I began to grow weary of the life I led. Methoughts it was time to think of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, the difficulty was to find the means of doing ſo, and procuring my Fathers conſent. Seeing very little like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of prevailing with him, I became extream Melancholy; the young people whoſe Company I frequented, knowing the cauſe of my ſadneſs, diſſipated it by ſome Diſcourſes, which revived my hopes that were half dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as about that time I happened to let fly ſome words,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108700:4"/>
which might be ill interpreted; My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reprehended me with ſo much ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that I left him immediately, and went to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where by good luck having found, that two Ships were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out for <hi>Genoa,</hi> I engaged my ſelf in one of them in quality of Boatſwain's Mate, being little concerned at the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy I had in it, or the place whither I went, provided only that I might Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</p>
               <p>On the 26th. of <hi>December</hi> in the Year 1667, having ſet Sail, we were hardly out of the <hi>Texel,</hi> when we perceived that our two Ships were not well ballaſted: thus, the ſhorteſt way was to return from whence we came, for the taking in as much Pewter and Cheſts of Quickſilver, as was requiſite for the giving them their juſt Weight. After which, we made Sail the ſecond time, on the firſt of <hi>Jan.</hi> in the following Year, in a time, when the Ice was extreamly thick.</p>
               <p>On the 10th. a quite contrary Wind conſtrain'd us to put in at <hi>Dunkirk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and two days afterwards, the Wind being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we purſued our Courſe; but we went not very far without being obliged to ſeek out a Haven to ſhelter us from the foul Weather and a very furious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108700:5"/>
The Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> being pretty near, we put in there and ſtayed until the 25th. When we weighed Anchor again, but were not deſtined without impediment to continue our Courſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for on the Morrow the Wind came again to be ſo contrary, that we found it very difficult to get into a Neighbouring Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>At length on the 6th. of <hi>February</hi> we caſt Anchor at <hi>Portland,</hi> from whence we Sail'd three days afterwards; and on the 10. the Currents carried us into the Bay of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> becauſe they were much ſtronger than the Wind; but on th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

put a ſtop to the Paſſion I had of going much farther, I re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ingaged my ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>While the Ships were fitting out, I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the Curioſity I had a long time of ſeeing that famous City. The Port on the South ſide is open, and beſet in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places with little Rocks, that lie even with the Water, and are dangerous in Tempeſtuous Weather. 'Tis built like an <hi>Amphitheater</hi> round about the Port, and is a moſt pleaſing Proſpect to the ſight. It is about Ten Miles in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, ſurrounded with good Walls; which however have not the appearance of being able to hold out againſt a long Siege, at leaſt, if the Beſieged do not make extraordinary Efforts to defend them. Their <hi>Militia</hi> is Compoſed of ſome Companies of <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Corſes,</hi> and others of light Horſe; ſome maintained for the watching along the Coaſts, and diſcovering the <hi>Turks;</hi> and the others, to hinder any ſecret Practices and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiraces in the City. The entrance of the Port is defended by Four Galleys, always ready upon occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there are a great number of them in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenal, which the <hi>Genouezes</hi> often lend to the <hi>Venetians</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> On
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108700:6"/>
one ſide of the Port ſtands a Tower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably high, where fires are kindled by night, for the regulating the Courſe of the Ships. There is at the foot of that Tower, a great Piece of Cannon mounted upon its Carriage, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without a Sentinel. The Guard of the Princes Palace is of Five Hundred Men all <hi>Germans,</hi> under a Colonel of the ſame Nation, who have their Quarters there. As for the Buildings of the City, they are all far beyond the <hi>Idea</hi> we can conceive of them: all Palaces, all of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, eſpecially along the Rivers ſide. But the Pomp of the Churches does exceed all theſe Beauties; there are Thirty Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Churches, in one of which they ſhew a Key of an exact Figure of an Emerauld perfectly good. In that of St. <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew,</hi> they keep the St. <hi>Suaire,</hi> whither the People flock upon the rumours of the Miracles that are done there. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is very Populous, and the Merchants are there in great numbers and very rich; their Principal Traffick is in Velvet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we may judge how great it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the number of the Workmen who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about it; I having been aſſured, that there was above Eight Thouſand of them at the time I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:108700:6"/>
On the 12th. of <hi>April</hi> we made Sail towards <hi>Velez Malga,</hi> whither we came in Four Weeks, from whence after two days repoſe, we made for <hi>Malgue,</hi> where we caſt Anchor on the 24th. of <hi>May.</hi> We were no ſooner there, but all the <hi>Bandities</hi> were ſet on Shore, and ſince that time we never heard of any of them. 'Tis well known how famous that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is for its Wine; whereof we took an Hundred Pipes on board us, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having provided our ſelves with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary refreſhments for the Sick, on the 29th. of <hi>May</hi> the Wind ſeconding our Deſigns, we weighed Anchor and made Sail towards <hi>Cap-Verd,</hi> where we were to ſtay and repoſe our ſelves for ſome time. This deſign made us judge, that the Voyage muſt needs be long; but none except the Officers, knew our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or whither we went.</p>
               <p>The 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> at night we found our ſelves near 9 Ships which we took for <hi>Corſaires.</hi> We were quickly ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Truth; for the Men of thoſe Ships having asked us, who we were, and from whence we came, we found they were <hi>Algermes.</hi> This News did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Alarum our Commander; but as he was brave, far from ſhewing, that he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108700:7"/>
was ſtartled at this rencounter, he told the <hi>Corſaires</hi> with a very good grace, that he only waited till break of day to make an Acquaintance with them, and he ſhould take it for an Obligation, would they come on board him, where he would take care that nothing ſhould be omitted for their being well entertained. At the ſame time turning towards our Officers; <hi>You ſee Gentlemen,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>what Gueſts we have to Treat, and what Diſhes we muſt prepare for their good Reception; they are in great numbers as you ſee, but that ſignifies nothing, and I hope that our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage will make them repent of their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if they have ſo much as to attack us.</hi> They made no Anſwer to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders Speech, but every one running to his Poſt, gave him to underſtand the reſolution they were in, of making a brave defence. And indeed, aſſoon as it was day, tho the Match was very unequal, all was diſpoſed in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that we had a kind of diſpleaſure to ſee the Enemies, who had the advantage of the Wind, make away from us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying a word more. From that time the Heavens were ſo favourable to us, that at the three Weeks end we found our ſelves near the Iſland of <hi>Boa-viſta.</hi> We
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108700:7"/>
had no ſooner caſt Anchor there, than the <hi>Bandities,</hi> who inhabit it, brought us a great Quantity of ſalted Goats-fleſh and other refreſhments. After which we loaded about ten Chaloupes with Salt. This Iſland does ſo abound in all ſorts of Fiſh, that provided, People fiſh ne're ſo little there, they take as many as they pleaſe: eſpecially the great Salmon-Trouts are there in ſo great abundance, that we took above fifteen Hundred of them in the ſpace of half a day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boa-viſta</hi> is one of the Iſlands of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd.</hi> Both near, and at a diſtance, noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be more agreeable to the ſight; and it is for its beauty it has received that name. 'Tis very Mountainous, and about ſome 7 Leagues diſtance from the Iſle of <hi>Sabu.</hi> 'Tis about Twenty Leagues in Circumference, and 'tis very hot. It has towards the North a bank of Sand of about Twenty Leagues in Length, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the Sea makes a terrible Noiſe.

after having remonſtrated to him, that he was too Brutal for ſo high a Dignity, threatned to have him Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and indeed the puniſhment had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended very cloſely theſe menaces, if the Officers of the Ship had not repreſented, how the execution might have very ill conſequences. Upon their inſtances, the Commander changed his Puniſhment, which was to be caſt into the Sea: his Attendants being terrified at that ſight, leapt into their Canoes, and ſcudded to Shore, as faſt as it was poſſible for them. No ſooner were they there, than they put themſelves in a poſture of Defence, to hinder us from coming on Land. Our Commander being full of Indignation at their daring to make Head againſt him, or fearing perhaps leſt they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was for want of Courage that he doubled his Preſents, filled two Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with Souldiers, whom he ordered to cut to pieces thoſe miſerable Wretches, if they had the temerity to oppoſe their Landing. Thoſe two Pinnaces being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by two more, our Men diſperſed the <hi>Cafres,</hi> and took in ſpight of their Teeth, all that they had occaſion for: and to revenge themſelves fully and finally, our Commander cauſed their Houſes and

their Gardens to be Plundred, and ſet Fire to the Temples of their Idols. In the mean time, the King having ſaved himſelf by ſwimming, ſeeing we had the better, and the lamentable condition we had reduced his Subjects to, aſſembled all his Forces, ſo as in a ſhort time we ſaw a Thouſand Canoes half loaden with Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions coming down the River, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability to have ſet Fire to our Ship, and make themſelves Maſters of our Lives: but their deſign had no effect by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence we uſed to get away from them, and to purſue our Courſe.</p>

                  <hi>Sierra Leona</hi> is the moſt proper place in the World for the taking in freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all other refreſhments. For beſides that the freſh Water is admirably good, there grows Millet, Oranges, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>Bananas,</hi> Cocoes, Wild-Grapes, Sugar Canes, Long Pepper, in a word, Fruits of all ſort sand Species. There is moreover excellent wood both for Dying and Building, which we might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided our ſelves with, as we did with all other things, had it not been for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture which happened to us. The Fiſh is very excellent, and in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; and all the Rocks which we ſaw, were covered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with great and excellent Oyſters. Tho there be a great deal of good freſh Water, its goodneſs however does not continue in all Seaſons; for about the Moneth of <hi>May,</hi> which is the beginning of the Rains, 'tis there ſo unwholeſome, that in ſtrangers it cauſes hot Feavors, bloody Fluxes, and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Diſeaſes. The malignity of the Rain at that time is ſuch, that ſo many drops are ſo many bliſtors upon the Skin, and as many Worms in the Clothes: for which reaſon, ſtrangers to whom it is only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ought not to provide themſelves with Water, until ſome Monthsafter it begins

               <p>The Inhabitants of that Country are not [however] black.

One of their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ornaments is to boar their Ears and Noſtrils, which they embeliſh with Rings of Gold and other Metals. The Men and Women go all naked, except a girdle made of the rind of a Tree, which hangs down to the middle of their Thighs. The further you go into the Country, the leſs Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity you meet with; the Inhabitants are cruel, and even eat one another; thoſe who dwell along the Sea Coaſts, are ſomewhat more tractable, by reaſon of the frequent Commerce they have with the <hi>Europeans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108700:15"/>
and if we would come on Shore, he would anſwer for't, that no miſchief ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us. The word of a Man we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, diſſipated our Fears; and we went on Shore, where we were kindly received by the King in Perſon, who was attended with a numerous Train. The King after having told us we were very welcome, had us along to his Palace. It is ſituated upon a riſing ground, and Reintrenched on all ſides: the inner parts of it are neat, and all covered with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fine Mats. The King asked the Commander who he was? whither he went? and for what deſign he had Caſt Anchor on his Iſland? to which the Commander anſwer'd, that he and his Men were <hi>Hollanders,</hi> but that they Sailed for the Service of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Genoa.</hi> The King having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him to inform himſelf of ſome other things, the Commander was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to hear him ſpeak <hi>Dutch</hi> ſo well, and asked him the reaſon of it; I have, replied the King, been the Slave of a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot called <hi>Iean Meas</hi> originally of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the neceſſity I was in, of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Tongue for to obey him, obliged me to learn it, and you ſee to

After that we had refitted our Ship, the day being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our Departure, the repugnance I had to the Name and Life of a Slave, made me hide my ſelf in the Iſland, where I have remained ever ſince that time. Did not you call your ſelf <hi>Diem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro,</hi> ſaid the Commander? how came you, replied the King, to know my Name? becauſe I had a Slave in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> rejoyn'd the Captain, who had all your Features, and whoſe Adventures were very like yours: I brought him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Accident you have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where he hid himſelf for fear of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing me, as you you ſay you did: in a word, I am that <hi>John Meas,</hi> and if I am not miſtaken, I meet again in you, what I loſt at my leaving of this Iſland.

I am obeyed by all here, and I will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have all obey you: do here what you pleaſe, and do not fear, that any one ſhould have the boldneſs to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict you.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, according to the Cuſtom uſed amongſt Friends of that Iſland, he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him his Wives, and made others do the ſame to all thoſe of his Ship, As the Women of that Country are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry avaricious of their Careſſes, and the <hi>Europians</hi> are a ſingular good ragouſt to them, far from ſuffering us to beg their favours, they offered themſelves, and that too with ſo good a grace, that it would have been very uncivil to have denied them.</p>

                  </hi> The Commander puts the Maſter of his Ship into his place, and would needs have the other come on Board of his, but inſtead of obeying, this laſt ſent word to the Commander, that he did not underſtand, why he ſhould be deprived of a Place that was his Due, and that he would not go out of his Ship but by force: at the ſame time cauſing all his Canon to be Mounted, that was at the bottom of the Hold, and prepared himſelf as if he had been to fight. On the Morrow the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ſeeing this Rebel had ſet up the Red Flagg, made preparations on his ſide, inſomuch as nothing was expected but the Hour of coming to Engagement. In the mean while the <hi>Boutefeu</hi> ſent a Chaloupe to a convenient place to take in Water; which the Commander per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, filled his own with Souldiers, with whom he went himſelf, and ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the buſineſs; that he conſtrained 'em
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108700:17"/>
to yield themſelves up, and put them all into Fetters, until he was made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Deſign. Whereupon he poſted himſelf in ſuch manner, as it was impoſſible for the other to ſtir from his place. Whereupon the chief of the Rebels ſeeing himſelf ſhut up on all ſides, and beſides his Men being weakened by the loſs of thoſe whom the Commander had taken, repented of the fault he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and fancied that the ſhorteſt way of reparation, was to yield himſelf up at the Commanders Direction. And taking along with him ſome of the Ships Crew, he went on Board, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, where as ſoon as he was come, he had Fetters put upon his Hands and Feet, notwithſtanding the cries of his Men, who proteſted, that if he was not releaſed, they were reſolved to fight to the extremity, and not give any Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This <hi>Bravado</hi> had ſo little effect, that upon the firſt reſiſtance, that was made to the two Pilots in the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Name to come on board him, they went thither as Sheep, and were treated after the ſame manner as the others. Thoſe who remained being daunted by the detention of their Leaders, loſt heart, and yielded upon diſcretion. By order
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108700:17"/>
of the Council of War, it was demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all the Officers, that were revolted, except the Maſter, Which they would chooſe rather, either to burn altogether with their Ship, or to ſubmit themſelves blindly to whatſoever Orders the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ſhould pleaſe to impoſe upon them? 'Tis eaſie to conjecture that they choſe rather to live than to undergoe ſo hard a Death: and indeed they promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be more ſupple than Gloves, and proteſted after having asked pardon, not to fall any more into ſuch like faults. As for the Maſter's Puniſhment, it was remitted until the return of the Ships to <hi>Genoa,</hi> and in the mean while, for the preventing ſuch like diſorders, they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the two Ship's Crew, whereof the half was obliged to go board the other. This buſineſs did very much delay our Voyage, for the time of continuing it, being paſſed before that all was ſet to rights again, we were forced to wait for another <hi>Monzoon;</hi> but as in the mean time we made good Chear, and ſpent our time in Hunting, Fiſhing, gathering excellent Fruits with which the Iſland abounds, we were eaſily comforted for that Rub in our Voyage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:108700:18"/>
From the Coaſts of <hi>Sofala</hi> to <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſcar,</hi> is reckoned about a hundred and Ten Leagues, and from the <hi>Mozambiques</hi> Fourty four. It is ſituated on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of the Coaſt of <hi>Zanguebar</hi> and the <hi>Cafrees;</hi> between the Eleventh and Sixteenth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Southern</hi> Latitude; and extends from 72 degrees of Longitude to 81: ſo that it is about 350 Leagues in Length from the <hi>South</hi> to the <hi>North;</hi> 120 in its greateſt breadth, and 900 in Circuit. The Iſland is divided into ſeveral Provinces, which are almoſt all parted by great Rivers.</p>
               <p>The Air is healthful and temperate, the ſoil very fertile in Fruits, as Oranges, Pome-citrons, Lemons, very large Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and Pulſe. It produces Ginger, Rice, Cotton, Saffron, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Roots. They gather Wax and Honey; ſeveral ſorts of Gums, Balm; Oyls, whoſe effects are admirable. There are ſeveral Mines of Gold and Silver: the Gold is much courſer there than in <hi>Peru,</hi> and every where elſe, but the Steel of this Country is moſt excellent. They have very choice Trees; as Ebony, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zile and Sandale Wood, Red, Yellow and White; Palm Trees of four or five ſorts, from which the <hi>Inſularies</hi> draw
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108700:18"/>
very great conveniences: and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are of no leſs profit than theſe. The Precious Stones which are moſt commonly found there, are <hi>Topa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, Amnectyſts, Emeraulds, Sapphires, Hyacinths</hi> and <hi>Agats.</hi> There are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lions, Elephants nor Horſes; but abundance of Tame and Wild Swine, Goats who bring forth four times in the Year. The Sheep are ſo fat, that their Tayles weigh from twenty to five and twenty Pounds. The Swine and wild Boares are there much fatter and more delicate than thoſe of <hi>Europe.</hi> There are likewiſe Porcupines, whoſe fleſh, tho ſomething harſh, has a moſt particular guſt. Theſe Animals ſleep there ſix Months together, and during that time their skin is renewed as well as that of their Hedg-hogs, which are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in this Iſland. The Dogs here are very ſmall, and moſt part of them flat-noſed, and without Hair; the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys are there in Troops, never leſs than fifty together, ſome are white of the bigneſs of a Fox; they are cruel and hard to be tamed; but there are ſome much ſmaller and browner, that are much more docible. Some very large, that only go upon their Hind Feet, whoſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108700:19"/>
Skins are white, and not ſo tawny as the reſt. Theſe love Women to that degree, that if they meet with one, they help one another to violate her every one in his turn, after which they tear her in pieces. There are thoſe, whoſe Eyes ſparkle like burning Coales; theſe are look'd upon as much the ſiner; but they are ſo wild, that when they are taken they ſtarve themſelves to Death. They have great Numbers of Martins, Weaſels and Squirrels, as likewiſe Scorpions, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Cheeſelips, and other hurtful Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, whoſe Venom is ſo ſubtile, that 'tis preſent Death to them who are ſtung. All manner of Gumm is there very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. The Iſland is inhabited both by Whites and Blacks; theſe are for the moſt part of a middle Stature; and their Hair is black and Curled: The Whites are ſomewhat bigger, their Hair is leſs black, leſs frizled, and much longer; they ſhave their Beards, and are tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and humane, becauſe they inhabit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Coaſts. But they who dwell in the midſt of the Iſland, never ſhave their Beards, nor cut their Hair. They are Brutal Savages, and without inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, like the <hi>Cafres.</hi> Treachery and Revenge are their Vertues; and thoſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108700:19"/>
who are the beſt inſtructed in 'em are the moſt eſteemed; but Charity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion are Monſters which they have a horrour for; and thoſe who have the leaſt grain of them, are reviled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. Idleneſs is natural to 'em, and they ſpend moſt of their time in ſinging and dancing. Notwithſtanding which, they have Workmen, as Smiths, Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Potters, Cord-makers, and Weavers that are expert enough in their Trades; ſome Goldſmiths they have, but they are none of the moſt dexterous. Fiſhing and Hunting are their ordinary Occupations.</p>
               <p>The places, whither they retire, are very pitiful Cottages, which nevertheleſs they are uſed to take poſſeſſion of with as much joy, as if they were the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Palaces. When theſe Hutts are in a condition to be inhabited, the Proprietors fix the day of their Entrance, and make a Feaſt, to which they invite their Relations and Friends; every one goes thither with Preſents, for it is forbidden to come with empty hands; and thoſe preſents conſiſt of Gold, Silver, Iron, Corn and Utenſils, that are in uſe with 'em. Some give Oxen, Sheep, Goats, Fruits; and all this mounts ſo high, that at the end of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, the Proprietor finds himſelf
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108700:20"/>
largely re-imburſed for his Building and his Entertainment. The Feaſt laſts for ſome days, during which they commit ſeveral Exceſſes. Their way of living is very plain, for they have neither Tables, Chairs, Seats, Table-Cloathes, Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, Beds or Pillows. Inſomuch that whether it be for eating or drinking, they have only a pitiful Mat ſpread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Floor.</p>
               <p>The Common People go almoſt all naked, and often without hiding what we dare not diſcover. Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have a kind of Drawers, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches down to the middle of their Legs; the reſt of the body is covered very negligently with a piece of Cotton. The Women are clothed with certain Robes, which reach but to their knees: ſome of thoſe Robes have Sleeves, and others none. They wear under them a kind of Drawers, which differs little from thoſe of the Men. They have a Handkerchief upon their Necks, much like to thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> Thoſe Robes are made of Cotton, rinds of Trees, and of Silk of ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, garniſhed with Guimps and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that differ much from the colour of the Stuffs. All the Inhabitants of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108700:20"/>
both Sexes, go bare-headed and bare-footed; except thoſe who are of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Race, whoſe Men wear a Bonnet much like a <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Cap; and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men an Hood or Ornament in form of a Pyramid which falls down upon their Shoulders.</p>
               <p>Their Weddings are Celebrated with very few Ceremonies, and upon very ſlight pretexts the Men put away their Wives. As it is neither a ſin nor ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to Careſs one another, the Men and Women make no ſcruple of doing ſo; and when Lovers are taken in the Fact, they are acquitted for a Preſent of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Value. For the Maids to Proſtitute themſelves is looked upon as a good honeſt Trade: the more they gain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the more are they eſteemed; and the moſt notorious Gallantry is the moſt ready way to Marriage. It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a kind of ſhame for Maidens not to know what it is before they are Contracted: they muſt firſt of all have made ſeveral Tryals, and when they have not Wit to find Gallants, their Mothers have the goodneſs to furniſh 'em with the means of ſo doing, and to teach 'em to keep thoſe whoſe Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they are. With all this facility
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108700:21"/>
there is nothing ſo Chaſte as the Tongue of the Women of <hi>Madagaſcar;</hi> and ſuch an one is more laſcivious and more debauched than <hi>Lais,</hi> that one would take for a <hi>Lucretia,</hi> if youdid not know her.</p>
               <p>When any Perſon dies, all the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aſſemble to waſh the Body; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they deck the Deceaſed with his fineſt Attire; put him on Rings, Pendants and Bracelets, afterwards they wrap him up in fine Linnen, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

carry about them any thing of a red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, becauſe their preſence, ſay they, would hinder the ſtopping of the bloud in the Wound, All being thus diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Prieſt approaches with meaſured ſteps, and with Devotion takes the Knife deſtined to that uſe, and ties a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin on his left Leg; the Father and Unckles of the Child do the ſame upon their Arms; and in that Equipage they follow the Prieſt thro the Door ſituated on the Weſt, into the Hut, where the Mother is in Bed with the Child. In fine, after the Circumciſion, the Fore-skin is caſt upon the ground, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Circumciſed be a Slave; but if free, the Fore-skin is put upon the Yelk of an Egg, whereon the Father or Unckle of the Child receive it from the hand of the Prieſts. After having put upon the Wound a Mixture of the bloud of a Cock and the Juice of Herbs, the Child is brought back to his Fathers Houſe, with <hi>Huzzas</hi> and Acclamations, which laſt the reſt of the day.</p>
               <p>To ſee theſe Grimaces, one would ſay, that theſe <hi>Inſularies</hi> are very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and very tender of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; however we may affirm, they are nothing leſs than that; for indeed they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108700:24"/>
neither ſincerity nor affection, which it is eaſie to prove. When they have a Child born, they give notice thereof to their Prieſts, who make thoſe ignorant People believe, they read in the Stars all that happens upon Earth. The Prieſt pretends to conſult the Heavens upon what is to happen to the Child; and according to the humour he is in, he ſpeaks well or ill of his future inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and if His Holineſs ſays, that he is born under an ill Conſtellation, that his manners will be corrupted, that he will be wicked, cruel and bloudy mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from that moment the Child is carried out of the Houſe and caſt into a Buſh, where it ſerves for food unto the Beaſts. If a Woman during her big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belly finds her ſelf more ill than uſually, they ſtick not to believe, that 'tis the Child who torments her, and this is an ill <hi>Omen:</hi> whereupon they give the Mother a certain Potion, which kills the Child; or if they wait till it be born, it is no ſooner born, but 'tis caſt into a Ditch, or into Water. This inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſo general, that all Women both Free and Slaves, make no ſcruple of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Fruit upon any pretext what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Sometimes it is by reaſon that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108700:24"/>
the Mother being a Slave, takes it ill to ſee her ſelf put away by her Maſter, who has deflowred her: ſometimes for that a white Maid being got with Child by a Blackmore, has ſome horrour of being the Mother of a Child of a different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and laſtly, ſometimes for that a Maid having got an itch to Libertiniſme, and is not willing to Marry, chooſes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to kill her Children, than take the trouble of breeding them up. But if the Women are unnatural, the Men do not fall ſhort of them in that ill Quality; for if it happens, that the Mother ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires in the Delivery, the Father cauſes the Child to be put in the ſame Coffin, ſaying, <hi>that it is better for it to be dead, than to be brought up by Strangers.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe unhappy pretences of getting rid of their Children, there are a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred others cauſed by Superſtition: thus it is no wonder, that this Iſland, as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous as it is, is however ſo thinly populated. Thoſe who inhabit towards the Coaſts being become more humane thro Commerce with ſtrangers, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs eaſie to put their Children to Death. When the Prieſt has told them his Sentiment, and gives them no good hopes, there are thoſe who will have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108700:25"/>
them educated privately by Slaves, who bring them up like Beaſts, to the end, (ſay they) that they may overcome by that means their ill nature.</p>
               <p>The Iſland is governed by ſeveral Kings, who are almoſt always in War. Their Armes are Bows and Arrows, Javelins and Targets; they do not want Courage, but they Fight without Rules and Art. Their principal dexterity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſurprizing the Enemy in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Place, and keeping him in play, while the others ſecure the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and burn all they meet with. In the mean while the Women take their pleaſure, and ſeek out all means of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but they dare not be unfaithful to their Husbands, at leaſt, thoſe who love them; believing that if they had any favour to their prejudice, they would not fail to be killed or dangerouſly wounded: whereas by making good chear without having to do with Men, the Husband would become both ſtronger and more couragious.</p>
               <p>During our abode in the Iſland, King <hi>Diembro</hi> having marcht againſt His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Head of Seven Thouſand Men, we went upon a Mountain, from whence we ſaw the field of Battel. The
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108700:25"/>
two Armies being in ſight, they began confuſedly with Javelins; then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to join, the ſtrongeſt flung his Man upon the Ground, and killed him without remiſſion; the Fight was long and doubtful, but at length, <hi>Diembro</hi> had the advantage, tho he was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in Number, thoſe who remain Conquerors, return to their Homes ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the greateſt noiſe comes from thoſe, who have been made Nobles, which is performed in this manner. some days before that of the Battel, there are Detachments drawn out on both ſides to skirmiſh; thoſe who are the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cut their Enemies Heads off, and carry and lay them at the Kings feet, who Careſſes 'em very highly, and gives 'em the Title of Noblemen: if in the following Wars, thoſe Noblemen bring ſtill more Heads, they are qualify'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, inſomuch as the Heads of their Enemies are as ſo many ſteps, which raiſe 'em to the higheſt Offices and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</p>
               <p>When they have a deſire to make Peace, the firſt means to attain it, is to make Preſents on both ſides, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the day for the Treaty. The day being come, both Armies ſet 'emſelves
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108700:26"/>
in Battel-Array upon the Banks of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which parts 'em: They kill a Bull on each ſide, out of whoſe Liver, Kings ſend one another a Portion, whereof they and their Generals eat in the preſence of their Deputies: at the ſame time they ſwear to execute punctually the Articles of Peace, which they had newly agreed to; which commonly conſiſt in never poyſoning the Waters nor Cattel more; and in not burning the Houſes, and in abſtaining from all Pillage: Wiſhing that the Liver they eat may ſerve 'em for Poiſon, if they ſpeak againſt their Thoughts.</p>

               <p>From thence we made towards the <hi>Sonda,</hi> and a little after that we were in the <hi>Streights,</hi> Fourteen <hi>Holland</hi> Ships came thundring upon us.

The <hi>Hollanders</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Order, bid us with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Tone, bring to them our Flag and ſtrike Sail, or they would ſink us to the bottom.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108700:27"/>
ſince their loſs was infallible, if they perſiſted to make reſiſtance; this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was applauded by all the Ships Crew, whoſe diſunion was ſo viſible, that they could hardly have lived long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er together: thus the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were received with open Arms. We were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoy'd at the changing of our Maſters, and never were any Men better pleaſed with coming out of Priſon, than our Men were to go into it. If the paſſion of Separating had not been ſo great among them, it would have been eaſie for them to have made their Eſcape by Night by the way of <hi>Batavia,</hi> for our Ship was a ſwift Sailer, and thoſe of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſo heavy, that we were always twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four Hours more advanced than they.</p>

The City Gates are ſo wretched, that they might be beaten down with a Club; but ſo vigilantly guarded, 'twould be hard to approach without notice; there are neither Baſtions nor Towers, but in lieu thereof Scaffolds of three Stories, which yield a ſtrong defence.</p>
               <p>In the whole City there are but three principal Streets, which all about upon the Caſtle called <hi>Pacebam.</hi> The one from the <hi>Pacebam</hi> to the Haven; another
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108700:29"/>
where the Kings Slaves and Domeſticks inhabits, leads to the Gate towards the Fields, and the third to the Gate at the foot of the Mountain. The Streets are not pav'd, but are as commodious, by means of the Sand they are covered with. The Channels which in divers places croſs the City, are foul and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in regard the Stream of the River is not ſtrong enough to carry off the filth it brings, and what is thrown forth choaks the Water, and makes Puddles, that infect the whole City. No Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality, but has his private Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or Moſquite in his Houſe; but one is common near the Palace on the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazin and Stable-ſide. The City is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral Poſts, each of which is aſſigned to ſome Perſon of Quality, who commands in time of War, and gives direction in Civil Affairs. They have a Drum as big as thoſe <hi>German</hi> Casks called Thunderbolts, uſed inſtead of Bells, which they beat with a wooden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar as big as a Weavers Beam, Morning and Evening, as alſo upon Alarums they have braſs Baſons, which they beat Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically and Chime upon, as we do our Bells.</p>

At every corner of the Streets there ſtands a Guard, and at Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſet they draw up to make faſt all paſſage Boats, ſo as in the Night there is no ſtirring in the Street. At the Priſon-Gate, near the Palace, ſtands a Guard of Fifty Men: nor is there a Perſon of Quality, who has not one of Ten or Twelve at his Houſe. The Town is full of Coco-Trees, nor is there a Manſion without divers belonging to it. The Houſes are poorly built of Straw Reeds upon Piles made like thoſe at <hi>Ackim.</hi> They cover their Houſes with Coco-Leaves, and the ſides of their Lodging Rooms have only Curtains for freedom of the Air, which is exceeding neceſſary in this hot Climate. For preſervation of their Wares they have ſtore Houſes of Stone, but they are covered with ſtraw, ſo as to ſecure them from fire, which is but too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent amongſt them; they lay great pieces of Timber on the Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Rooms in their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are only divided by partitions made of Canes called <hi>Bamboos,</hi> which they ſlit ſo thin, that a Horſe-Load ſerves for all the Rooms in their Houſes. At the Houſes of Perſons of Quality upon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108700:30"/>
the firſt Entrance, you come into a Square Court, where the Guard is, and where the Maſter of the Houſe ſpeaks with ſuch as have buſineſs with him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a little ſhed, covered with Canes or Coco-leaves, in one of the corners of this Court ſtands the Moſquite, where at Noon they do their Devotions, and not far thence the Ciſtern where they waſh themſelves. Being entred the Houſe, you find on both ſides of a very narrow Gallery ſeveral little Nicks, for Slaves to reſt in, who watch there for their Maſters ſecurity; by reaſon they are all afraid of being ſurprized and killed by their enemies in the night. All Foreigners, as the Natives of <hi>Benga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> as <hi>Guſurats, Malayans, Abyſſins, Chineſes, Portugals,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> ly out of Town.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108700:31"/>
the great Meſquite divided from it by a Paliſado. To this place Women reſort with Sacks, and a weight of three Pounds, they call <hi>Gantam,</hi> who buy Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Country People, an eight or nine Hundred <hi>Caxas</hi> the <hi>Gantam.</hi> But the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> who are very skilful in this Trade, foreſtal them ſometimes, for they go to the Peaſants, and buy all they have by the lump before-hand.

               <p>A little higher on the Right Hand are Armorers, who ſell ſmall pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Piſtols, Sword-blades, Battle-axes, &amp;c. Not far thence, there are others that ſell Sandale Wood, White and Yellow, and on the Left Hand are Confectioners that ſell Sugar, Honey, and all ſorts of Sweet-meats wet or dry. Near to that is the Bean-Market, where are ſold all ſorts of Beans, black white, red, yellow, green and gray, at the three Hundred <hi>Caxas</hi> the <hi>Gantam.</hi> Next to this is the Onion Market, where the Merchants that ſell Cloth by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale come, and ſuch as deal in return of Money, and aſſurances of the return in

Veſſels. Hard by this is the Poultry, where beſides tame Fowl, they ſell alſo Kids, Geeſe, Pidgeons, Parrots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence you meet with 3 ways, one going to the <hi>Chineſes</hi> ſhop, another to the Herb and Pulſe Market; and the 3<hi>d.</hi> to the Shambles. By the way to the <hi>Chineſes</hi> ſhops, on the Right Hand are ſome Jewellers, who for the greater part are <hi>Choroacones,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Perſians</hi> or <hi>Arabians,</hi> who ſell Rubies, Hyacinths, Turqueſſes, Granats, &amp;c. And on the Left Hand is the place for the <hi>Bengalians,</hi> with their Toys and ſmall Wares. On the back ſide of this Street, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> ſell their Silks Raw and Coloured, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask, Velvet, Sattins, Brocadoes of Gold and Silver, Purcelane Cabinets and works of Lacques, &amp;c. By the way to the Herb Market, on the Right Hand upon the Sand, are the <hi>Bengalians</hi> with their ſmall Wares. On the Left Hand Merchants of Linnen-Cloth, and at the lower end of this Market, Married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have Seamſtreſſes ſhops; but Men are forbidden to come there under pain of a Forfeiture. Then you come to the Herb Market, where are a multitude of Simples unknown to us. Turning thence you ſee the Fiſh-market, then the ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108700:32"/>
with Stalls full of Beef, Buffles and Veniſon: Then the Spice-market, where Women ſell Peper, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, &amp;c. and all ſorts of Gumms and Druggs, to <hi>Europians</hi> unknown: and the Rice-market where likewiſe they ſell Earthen Ware and Salt; whence they paſs by the ſame way they came to the place, where Merchants and Maſters of ſhips meet about their Affairs:</p>
               <p>The ſale of theſe Commodities laſts but till Nine of the Clock, and then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the Market before the <hi>Pacebam,</hi> or Palace-Royal, where are ſold all ſorts of Victuals, as likewiſe ſome Pepper, which they truck with the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Noon the Market in the <hi>Chineſes</hi> Quarters begins, where nothing is ſold but for the Table.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Bantam, Tuba,</hi> or <hi>Tuban,</hi> is the Chiefeſt Town in <hi>Java,</hi> and in effect is ſtronger than all the reſt, and although not ſo great as <hi>Bantam,</hi> 'tis at leaſt as handſome; and as well built. The Palace is exceeding ſpacious, and hath very fair Apartments, where Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants and other Beaſts have their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Quarters: each Elephant hath his Lodge built upon four Pillars, with a Poſt in the middle to tie him to. The
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108700:32"/>
Rooms are filled with Cheſts, and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers for the Baggage, when the King goes His Progreſs. Near to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is a place where his Game-Cocks are kept every one in his Pen apart, and every one his keeper; as likewiſe the Parrats, which are much before thoſe brought into theſe Parts, the greateſt part of a beautiful flame colour, with a great Golden ſpot on the back: The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of their Wings blue and red, and the in-ſide a lovely Carnation. They are to endure the inconveniencies of a long Voyage: beſides the <hi>Indians</hi> highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem them, for that they love their ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and delight to be made much of by them. The King of <hi>Tuban</hi> was much taken with all theſe Creatures, as alſo with Dogs, Horſes, and white Ducks, much larger than ours. He had four legitimate Wives, Six Sons, and Two Daughters; beſides Natural Children, a great number by Concubines, which he kept in ſeveral Apartments: His Bed was raiſed at ſome diſtance from the Ground, built like an Altar of Great Stones, whereon lay a Quilt, and certain Pillows of Satin, filled with raw Silk.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:108700:33"/>
The chief Commerce they have at <hi>Tuban</hi> conſiſts in Pepper, which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Iſle of <hi>Bady,</hi> where they truck it for Cloth and Stuffes of Cotton and Silk, which afterwards they bring to <hi>Banda, Toanate,</hi> and the <hi>Philippins,</hi> and other parts, to truck for Cloves, Mace and Nutmegs, The Inhabitants for the greateſt part, live only on Fiſh. They wear no other Garments than a Linnen Cloth about the Loyns; only Perſons of the Firſt Quality have ſometimes Hangſelines of Chamelet, which reach but to their Knees. They are by this Habit diſtinguiſhed from others Perſons, and by their Trains of Slaves, without whom they never come abroad. They delight much in Horſes, and to have their Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles exceeding Rich, which are made like our great Saddles; only their Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings ſtudded with Gold and Silver, ſtriving to appear well Mounted at Aſſemblies, and to ſhew the King their Horſemanſhip, and the dexterity of their Horſes.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants that live in the inner part of the Iſle of <hi>Java</hi> are <hi>Pagans,</hi> and the greateſt part <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> believing a Tranſmigration of the Soul; for which reaſon they eat neither Fiſh nor Fleſh.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108700:33"/>
Towards the <hi>South</hi> part of the Iſle, there are, tho but few, <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion in all things, ſending for Prieſts to <hi>Mecca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They obſerve two great Feſtivals, the greater of the two begins the 5<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt;</hi> and at the beginning of this faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lent</hi> it is, the Slaves renew their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their Maſters, with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies extraordinary; for they take them by the Feet, and rub 'em upwards to the Knees; then cloſing their Hands, they rub the Head, Face and Neck, and then uncloſe them again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lent</hi> being ended, they celebrate their <hi>Eaſter,</hi> entertaining their Children and all their Domeſtics with a Dinner. There is ſcarce a Man in <hi>Bantam,</hi> who hath not three or four Wives, and ſome have ten or twelve, beſides Concubines, who wait on their Wives, eſpecially when they go abroad: they make no difference between legitimate and natural Children: a Father hath not power to ſell his Child though he had it by a Slave. Children go ſtark naked, only the Girls cover their Privities with a thin Plate of Gold and Silver: they marry at the AGe of Eight, Nine or Ten Years, not only to prevent the Diſorders, which in this hot Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108700:34"/>
were inevitable, but becauſe the King is Heir to all who dying leave their Children under Age, whom he makes his Slaves, as he doth the Widdows and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the deceaſed. The Dowry which Perſons of Quality give with their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters conſiſts in Slaves of both Sexes, and in a ſum of <hi>Coxas,</hi> which is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable among them when it amounts to three hundred thouſand, tho it be but much about twenty two Crowns and a half of our Money.</p>
               <p>The Women appear with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency at the Marriage of their Relations, tho they uſe no great Ceremony. One may know the day by certain Poles, which are ſtuck in the Houſes of the Bride and Bridegroom, with Taſſels of red and white Cotton.</p>
               <p>Dinner ended, they bring a Horſe to the Bridegroom, whereon he rides about the Town till Evening, expecting the Slaves he is to have in Marriage, who come commonly loaden with Preſents. None but the neareſt Kindred ſup with them, and ſee the new Married Couple abed.</p>
               <p>Women of the firſt Rank are kept in ſuch reſtraint, that their own Sons are not ſuffered to come into their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108700:34"/>
and when they go abroad, which is very ſeldom, all give place and reſpect to them, even the King himſelf does it: nor dares any Man ſpeak to a Married Woman without the leave of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Women of Quality are known from others only by their Train; for all are dreſſed after the ſame Faſhion, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Petticoat of Cotton or Silk, which comes from the Breaſt to the mid-leg, Stockings they have none, and go all bare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>headed, tying up their Hair toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the Crown of their Head; but, when they come to Weddings or other Publick Aſſemblies, they wear a Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of Gold, and have Coronets and Bracelets on their Fingers, and about their Arms. They are ſo much addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Cleanlineſs, that there paſſes not a day, but they bath themſelves three or four times. They never do their natural Neceſſities, nor receive their Benevolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from their Husbands, but they go up to the neck in Water to cleanſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: they do no work at all, which is no wonder; ſince the Husbands them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves having employed two or three Hours about their Merchandize, all the day after do nothing but chew <hi>Bettele</hi> amongſt their Wives, who are very ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108700:35"/>
by all the little Kindneſſes, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to court their Loves, waſhing and rubbing 'em till they are ſtirred up to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate of the Town of <hi>Bantam</hi> ſits in Judicature in the Court of <hi>Pace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam,</hi> from four or five in the evening un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be night. The Plaintiff and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant appear both in Perſon, and plead their own Cauſe. One only Puniſhment is uſed for Criminals; that is, they tie them to a Poſt, and ſtab them to death with a Ponyard. Strangers have this privilege, that giving ſatisfaction to the party complaining, they may redeem themſelves from death, except they have murdered in cold bloud, or upon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>The Kings Council meets upon Affairs of State under a broad ſpread Tree by Moon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>light, where ſometime there comes near five Hundred Perſons, who part not till the Moon goes down. When the Council is riſen, they go to Bed, and there ly till Dinner. Afterwards the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of State give audience to all who have ought to propoſe to the Council. When the King comes there in Perſon, he ſits in the midſt of them, or elſe with the four Principal Miniſters of State, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108700:35"/>
propounds the point wherein he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their advice, or cauſes the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Town to propound it, To a Council of War they call the three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Captrins, Commanders of the Troops the Armies conſiſt of, which are raiſed in the Town it ſelf. They have a particular courſe for quenching Fire, which happecs but too often among 'em; for the Women have this office impoſed upon them, while the Men ſtand in Arms to defend 'em in the mean time from Pillage.</p>
               <p>Perſons of Quality, when they go to Court, or through the Town, they have carried before them a Lance and a Sword ſheathed in a black Velvet Scabbard, and by theſe Enſigns oblige all the Street to make way for them, and retiring back to ſit on their Heels, till theſe Grandees are paſt. Their ordinary wear is of Stuff wrought with Silk, and they wear Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bants of a fine <hi>Bengalian</hi> Cloth. Some amongſt them wear <hi>Mandillions</hi> of Velvet black or crimſon, and never forget the Dagger or Poniard under their Girdle. They ever go with a numerous Train of ſlaves, one amongſt them carrying the <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi> Bottel, another the Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pot, and a third the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrello.</hi> They all go bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108700:36"/>
it being thought a diſparagement among 'em to walk with Shooes thro the Town. In their Houſes many wear 'em; they are made at <hi>Achim, Malacca,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> where are alſo made moſt part of the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Bantamites</hi> are haughty, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited, perfidious, miſchievous, and cruel; who never fail to make an end of ſuch they get advantage of; and having once committed a Murder they kill all in their power; for knowing Death to be their inevitable reward, their diſcharge their fury indifferently on all they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, without conſideration of Sex or Age: ſo as ſometimes they are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to kill them in the place, inſtead of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to be delivered up into the Hands of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>They generally wear long Hair, are of a Cheſnut Complexion, having great Jaw Bones, flat Faces, great Eyebrows, little Eyes, thin Beard; and being of a middle ſtature, well ſet, and ſtrongly limb'd. They are naturally addicted to Theft, and ſo vindicative, that to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of an Enemy they ſtick not to turn upon his Weapon, and chooſe an aſſured Death to take away anothers Life.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108700:36"/>
Of which there was an example during the King of <hi>Bantam</hi>'s beſieging <hi>Batavia</hi> in the Year 1659. a <hi>Dutch</hi> Souldier lying in Ambuſhcade in a Marſh, a <hi>Bantamite</hi> little dreaming that any body had been there, came to the ſame place to diſcover the Enemy, and was by the <hi>Dutchman</hi> thruſt with his Pike into his body. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>Bantamite</hi> finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wounded, did not ſtrive to pull the Pike out of his body, but thruſt himſelf further upon it, to the end he might come at his Enemy, whom he ſtabb'd to the heart as ſoon as he got within his reach.</p>
               <p>This bloudy diſpoſition ſhews, they have courage, and would make good Souldiers, were they but as dexterous at Fire Arms, as they are at their uſual weapons, which are the Pike, the Battle-Axe, and the Broad Sword, but above all the Dagger or Poniard. Their Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are of Wood or boyled Leather ſtretch'd upon a Hoop; and for their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they have <hi>Cuinaſſes,</hi> the pieces being faſtned together with Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Bantamites,</hi> as indeed all the reſt of the <hi>Indians,</hi> hold their Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſo dear to them, that they will not ſpeak to any Man without that by their ſide, not one Brother with another, and at Night they lay it under their Bolſters. Some uſe Trunks, thorow which they blow little poyſoned Arrows, ſo bearded that pulling it out, the Head remains in the Wound, which by theſe means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes incurable and mortal. Amongſt ſuch a multitude of Villains, there are notwithſtanding ſome honeſt People, but the number is very ſmall; for except ſome that inhabit near <hi>Bantam</hi> upon the Streight of <hi>Sunda,</hi> at the foot of the Mountain <hi>Gonon Bezar,</hi> who were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted thither from <hi>Paſarvan,</hi> all the reſt are depraved.

               <p>The Soil is cultivated either by free People, who take it of their King or other Lords at a certain Rent, and are not bound to labour longer than by their Bargain, and may afterwards do what they pleaſe; or by Slaves, who cultivate their Pepper, Rice and Cocoes, breed Poultry and Cattel for their Maſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and ſupply his Kitchin. Some Slaves take the Cocoes at 1000 <hi>Caxaes</hi> the Tree. Others work by the day, and get Eight Hundred <hi>Caxaes</hi> the day, which is to their Maſters profit. Others are not maintain'd by their Maſters, but ſerve them ſix days, and the ſix days follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work for themſelves, and ſo get their Livelihood. The Women-Slaves keep Market, where they ſell their Maſters Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and other Commodities; or elſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves in ſcouring or making Cloth, that they might not live unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. When they have a mind to be cas'd of them, they lead 'em from Port to Port, and ſell them to him who will
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108700:38"/>
give moſt. The ordinary price for one of an able body, is five <hi>Fardoes,</hi> that is about a Piſtol a piece. The Children of a Slave belong to the Maſter, who diſpoſes of 'em as he thinks beſt; but he hath not power over the life of his Slave, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs conſent of the King or Governour.</p>
               <p>The Pepper, which the <hi>Bantamites</hi> ſell to Strangers, is uſually mix'd with Ordure, black Sand, or Gravel; or they adulterate it ſome other way, either in quality or weight, as they do all their other Commodities. They keep a Trade amidſt all the neighbouring Iſlands, with notable advantage. At the Towns of <hi>Macaſſer</hi> and <hi>Surubya</hi> they fetch Rice, which there they buy for one <hi>Sata de Caxa</hi> the <hi>Gantan,</hi> and ſell it for double the Price.

               <p>Rich Merchants make no Voyages themſelves, but venture the greateſt part of their Money for more or leſs profit, as the Voyages are long and dangerous, and near upon the like Conditions we do here in <hi>Europe.</hi> Obligations, as all other Inſtruments, are written upon the Bark of a Tree, the Letters ingrav'd with a Bodkin; and they make it up in a Roll, or fold it four-ſquare betwixt two Boards, which they tye together with a Pack-thread very neatly: ſometimes they uſe <hi>China</hi> Paper, which is very fine and of all colours.

               <p>In the King of <hi>Bantam</hi>'s Dominions are all ſorts of Beaſts, both wild and tame: the Foreſts are full of Elephants and Rhinocerots, Leopards and Tygers, which are more cruel and furious than thoſe of any other place, and do ſo much miſchief, that People go not without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to gather Frankincenſe, Maſtick, Myrrhe, and Benjamin, which is there in its greateſt Perfection, and whereof there were great quantity to be gotten, if the Forreſts were not almoſt inacceſſible, by reaſon of the Wild-Beaſts, as alſo for Serpents, Lizards and Salamanders, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dangerous, and of ſo extraordinary a growth, that there are Serpents have ſwallowed Children and Sheep, eaten <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and Leopards, often come out of the

               <p>The Rivers breed Fiſh in abundance, and Oyſters have there been ſeen, that have weighed three Hundred Pound; a thing that would ſeem incredible if there were not two Oyſter-ſhells, which weigh four Hundred ſixty and ſeven Pounds, now to be ſeen in the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi>'s Cabinet at <hi>Gottorp,</hi> that were brought by a Sea-Captain from the <hi>Indies:</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain affirming, that there was ſo much Meat in them, that it ſufficed all that were in the Ship, being a Hundred and twenty Perſons.</p>
               <p>'Tis very hard to hunt Deer, Goats, Boars, and other Game, fallow or black, which abound there, in regard the Woods are ſo thick, that 'tis impoſſible to make any way through them; and the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamites</hi> are ſo unskilful at their Fire-Arms, that it hath been obſerved, that a <hi>Bantamite</hi> having ſhot a wild Buffler, made a ſhift to kill the Beaſt: but, the Muſquet recoyling he fell down, with his Cheek all bruiſed, and the loſs of two of his Teeth; inſomuch as theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

               <p>In the Rivers there is abundance of Crocodiles, which ſeize not only on Men bathing, but attempt the very <hi>Canoes</hi> as they paſs along, ſnatching men out of 'em, and dragging 'em to the bottom.

him, which they uſe not in Medicine, not only the Fleſh, the Bloud, the Horn, the Teeth, but even his very Dung; they hold there is no better Antidote againſt Poiſon, and attribute the ſame qualities to this, as Ancient Authors do to the Unicorn.</p>
               <p>The Ants are exceeding troubleſome in moſt of theſe places, but eſpecially in the Country of <hi>Bantam.</hi> They are much bigger than in our parts, and ſo miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, that there is no Stuff, but what they ſpoil, no Victuals but what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, if they can get to't; wherefore they ordinarily ſet the feet of Tables and Cupboards on diſhes half filled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to hinder the Ants from creeping up; and 'twere impoſſible to preſerve any Birds, did not they ſet them on Poles planted in a diſh of Water; for ſhould they put them in a Cage, the Ants would get up and kill 'em.

                  <hi>Faufel,</hi> and the <hi>Malayans, Pinang.</hi> It is a kind of <hi>Coco,</hi> but not ſo great, nor the Leaves ſo big and broad: the Fruit is like a Date; Nature encloſes it in a Husk, which opens not till it flower, and when it ripens the Shell falls off, the fruit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at the Branch. It hath ſcarce any Taſt, but it moiſtens the Mouth, dyes the Lips red, and the Teeth black. The <hi>Indians</hi> lap it up in a <hi>Bettele</hi> Leaf, mix a little Chalk or Lime with it, and chew it rather out of Cuſtom than for any Pleaſure, though they hold that it ſtrengthens the Stomach and Gums, and is a topical Medicine againſt the Scurvy; and in effect, there is ſcarce an <hi>Indian</hi> that is ſubject to this Diſeaſe or troubled with the Tooth-ach. This Drug will make ſome People ſo drunk, that all things to 'em ſeem to run round; but that dizzineſs is preſently over.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mangas</hi> grow on Trees not much unlike our Nut Trees, but they have not ſo many Leaves: They are of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Peach, but longer and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bending like a Creſcent of a light green, drawing a little towards the red. It has a great ſhell, that encloſes an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond of greater length than breadth, and eaten raw is very diſtaſtful, but roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

They get them, while they are green, and put 'em up in Salt, Vinegar, and Garlick, and then they call them <hi>Mangas d'acher,</hi> and they ſerve inſtead of Olives. There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wild ones, which they call <hi>Mangas bravas,</hi> of a pale green too, but brighter than the other, and full of Juice, which is immediate Death without a preſent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ananas</hi> is one of the lovelieſt, pleaſanteſt, and wholeſomeſt Fruits of the <hi>Indies:</hi> it grows on a Buſh, and hath Leaves like <hi>Sempervivum;</hi> the Fruit at firſt is green<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but being ripe, turns Orange or Aurora coloured, drawing a little to a red, ſharp like a Pine-Apple; for which reaſon, the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> who met with this Fruit firſt in <hi>Braſil,</hi> called it <hi>Pinas;</hi> but 'tis tender an eaſie to cut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis yellow within, of a delicate Scent; 'tis eaten in Wine, but the exceſs is dangerous for Feavers; the Juice is ſo ſharp, that if one wipe not the Knife it is cut with, next Morning it will be found eaten.

take Root in the Earth, tho it have not paſt two or three Leaves, be half wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have been cut fifteen days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

At a diſtance they look like Artichoaks, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are not ſo picked as the Leaves of that Plant: the Stalk is like that of a Thiſtle, and every ſtalk bears but one, and that at the top of it; for tho many times it puts forth at the ſide other ſtems, yet the Fruit that comes of 'em is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall, and ſeldom comes to Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They have of them in <hi>March,</hi> and then they are very pleaſant, for the Juice hath the Taſte of ſweet or new Wine, and is exceeding eaſie of digeſtion, but it heats and after brings a Fever.</p>
               <p>In the Territories of <hi>Bantam</hi> there is another Fruit called <hi>Lamnea;</hi> 'tis as big as a Citron, the Colour green, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing drawing to a red; full of Juice that is tart and Toothſome, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hath divers black Kernels: the Leaves are like thoſe of Lemmon Trees, but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108700:44"/>
not ſo long: they put them up in Salt or Sugar, or uſe them as <hi>Tamarinds</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt burning Feavers, Inflammations of the Breaſt, againſt pains in the Stomach and Fluxes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamarinds</hi> grow on great Trees full of Branches, whereof the Leaves are not bigger, nor unlike to the Leaves of <hi>Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernel,</hi> only ſomewhat longer. The flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at firſt is like the Peaches, but at laſt turns white, and puts forth its Fruit at the end of certain ſtrings: aſſoon as the Sun is ſet, the Leaves cloſe up the Fruit, to preſerve it from the Dew, and open aſſoon as that Planet eppears again. The Fruit at firſt is green, but ripening, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of a dark gray, drawing towards red, incloſed in husks, brown or tawny, of taſte a little bitter, like our Prunelloes. Every husk contains three or four little Beans in a certain skin, which is that the <hi>Portugals</hi> call <hi>Tamarincho.</hi> The Fruit is viſcous, and ſticks to the Fingers, but of ſo good a taſte, that the <hi>Indlans</hi> uſe it almoſt in all Sawces, as we do Verjuice; but 'twould turn a mans Stomach to ſee them cook meat with this Drug: for ſqueezing it between their hands, the juice that runs through their fingers looks more like a Medicine than a Sawce. Theſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108700:44"/>
Trees bear twice in the Year, and grow every whete without being planted, or otherwiſe looked after. Phyſicians uſe this Drug againſt burning Feavers, heat of the Liver, and Diſeaſes in the Gall; and infuſed a Night in cold Water, it purges gently. The <hi>Tamarinds</hi> brought to our Parts, are either Salted or preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Sugar. The Inhabitants of the Iſle of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> where there grows plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, call it <hi>Quille,</hi> and the <hi>Bantamites Sundalaſſa.</hi> The <hi>Portugals</hi> give it the name of <hi>Tamarinches,</hi> for the reſemblance the Fruit holds with the Date of <hi>Arabia,</hi> called <hi>Tamar,</hi> as if they would ſay, Dates of <hi>India.</hi> The <hi>Malabars</hi> call it <hi>Pali,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Indians Ampuli:</hi> the Tree is as big as a Walnut Tree, full of Leaves, bearing its Fruit at the Branches, like the ſheath of a Knife, but not ſo ſtrait, rather bent like a Bow. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> when they would tranſport their <hi>Tamarinds,</hi> take them out of the Husks, and make them up in Balls as big as a man's Fiſt, unhandſom to look on, and worſe to handle.</p>
               <p>Common it is in this Country to plant Pepper near a ſort of Canes, by the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamites</hi> called <hi>Mambu,</hi> in which the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baxir</hi> is found. 'Tis true, in the Iſle of

Theſe Canes are as big as the Body of a Poplar, having ſtrait Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Leaves ſomething longer than the Olive tree. They are divided into divers knots, wherein there is a certain white Matter like Starch, for which the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> give the weight in Silver, for the Uſe they make of it in Phyſick, againſt burning Feavers, and bloudy Fluxes, but eſpecially upon the firſt approaches of any Diſeaſe: and which, according to their Application, is a Soveraign Remedy againſt the Stone.</p>
               <p>Theſe Canes are ſo big, that the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> cleave them to make Boats, leaving Knots at each end, whereon they ſit to guide it, one before, another behind, and uſe this ſort of Boat the rather, for that they are perſwaded <hi>Crocodiles</hi> bear a reſpect to the <hi>Mambu,</hi> and never hurt the Boats made of this Cane.</p>

In the Iſle of <hi>Java</hi> there is another Fruit, called amongſt the <hi>Malagars Duri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aon,</hi> not to be ſeen any where but in this place, and the <hi>Malaccaos.</hi> The Tree that bears 'em, by the <hi>Malagars</hi> called <hi>Batan,</hi> is as big as our Apple-tree, the Bark thick, plentiful of Boughs, and wealthy in fruit: the Bloſſom, which they call <hi>Bnaa,</hi> is white, inclining to yellow, and the Leaves half a Foot in length, and two or three Fingers broad; on the out-ſide of a pale Green, drawing towards a Grey, but on the in-ſide the Green is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and lively; the Fruit is as big as a Melon, covered with a thick rough Rind, green, and hath ribs, as the Melons. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 'tis divided into four quarters, which are again divided into two or three lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cells, that contain the Fruit, which is as big and white as a Pullets Egg, and of taſte ſo delicious, that the <hi>Bianc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Lantor</hi>-Tree, which is another ſort of <hi>Cocoe</hi>-Tree, as we ſaid before, is frequent in the Iſle of <hi>Java;</hi> the Leaves are five or ſix foot long, and ſo ſmooth that the <hi>Bantamites</hi> write upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it with a Bodkin, and uſe it inſtead of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

fetch'd it thence, to furniſh other Parts, before the <hi>Portugals</hi> or <hi>Hollanders</hi> had any Commerce there. This fruit grows upon another Tree like Pepper, and in Bunches like Grapes. The <hi>Bantamites</hi> knowing it to be no where but with them, eſteem it ſo much as they will not ſuffer a Plant to go from them, and ſell it not unboyl'd, for fear it ſhould be planted elſewhere, tho there is ſuch plenty of it, that at <hi>Bantam</hi> a Weight of fifty ſix Pounds is worth but ſix, or at moſt, ſeven thouſand <hi>Caxaes.</hi> The Uſe of it is, to fortifie the Stomack, and cleaſe the Breaſt, but the <hi>Mahometans</hi> take it with a little <hi>Arek,</hi> and are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it reſtores languiſhing and ſpent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Manghoſtan</hi> is a fruit growing by the High-ways of <hi>Bantam,</hi> upon Buſhes, like our Sloes, and much of the ſame taſte.</p>

In <hi>Java</hi> they have another Fruit, which grows likewiſe in other places call'd <hi>Jaca,</hi> in form and bigneſs like a <hi>Citrul,</hi> with a thick and rough Rind; Within 'tis full of certain Nuts, the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels whereof being roaſted on Coals, are good to eat, and ſtay the flux of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Tree is very great, but the Boughs not being ſtrong enough to bear the fruit, it hangs all along the Body of it, up from the very ground: Being full ripe, the Rind grows hard and black, and emits a very ſweet ſcent; the fruit it ſelf chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es taſte, yielding one while that of the Melon, another that of the Peach, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that of Honey, ſometimes that of ſweet Lemon; but is ſo hard of digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that 'tis never eaten, but vomited up again. The Nut of it is as big as a Date, and cauſeth windineſs in thoſe that eat it green, but roaſted after the manner we told you, they are very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and good for ſuch as have a kindneſs for Women.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Iſland, towards the Streight of <hi>Sundy,</hi> grows alſo abundance of wild Cinnamon, which the <hi>Portugals</hi> call <hi>Canela de Mato,</hi> and <hi>Malayans Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jumanis.</hi> It is not near ſo good as the fine Cinnamon, whence it comes,

there's but very little of it bought, it being hardly worth the Tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Carcapuli</hi> is a Fruit about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Cherry, and much of the ſame taſte, and the Trees which bear it are like our Cherry-Trees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of theſe there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds, whereof ſome are white, ſome of a dark red, and ſome of a lively Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Colour.</p>

The <hi>Bantamites</hi> give it to their Horſes, compounding it with Garlick, Cummin-ſeed, Salt, Sugar, and Butter, making it into a Paſte, which they call <hi>Arata;</hi> and they hold it very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign for their Beaſts, to whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they never give it, till the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the Heats be over.</p>

The <hi>Zerumbal,</hi> which the <hi>Bantamites</hi> and <hi>Malayans</hi> call <hi>Canior</hi> too, grows in theſe parts and is like to Ginger, only the Leaves ſomewhat more long and broad. They uſe to dry it, or preſerve it in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, as they do Ginger, but eſteem it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Ginger.</p>
               <p>There are two kinds of <hi>Galanga,</hi> by the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Calvegian.</hi> The leſſer comes from <hi>China,</hi> and is much better than that which is brought out of the Iſle of <hi>Javan,</hi> where they call it <hi>Lanquas.</hi> This Herb is neither ſowed nor ſet, but grows naturally, and is about two foot high above the ground. The Flower is white, and the Leaves pointed, and as hard as the point of a Knife. The <hi>Banta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> uſe it for a Sallad, as alſo in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, as they do the Root, which is thick and long, and full of knots like a Cane, as biting in taſte as Ginger, and of a very ſweet ſcent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Benjamine</hi> is a Gum diſtilling from Trees, not unlike Lemon trees. While they are young the <hi>Benjamine</hi> is black, which is the beſt. But as they grow old the <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> grows white, and loſes ſtrength; ſo as to put it off they mingle it with black. The <hi>Moors</hi> call it <hi>Louan Javii,</hi> that is, <hi>The Incenſe of Java.</hi>

In the Foreſt of <hi>Java,</hi> Trees there grow of red <hi>Sandale,</hi> but the white and yellow <hi>Sandale,</hi> which is without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon the better, comes from the Iſles of <hi>Timor</hi> and <hi>Salor.</hi> This Tree is of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Walnut-Tree, and bears a fruit not unlike our Cherries, but 'tis black and inſipid. The <hi>Indians</hi> beat white and yellow <hi>Sandale,</hi> and make a Concoction, wherewith they rub their Bodies, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the odour, but for that they believe 'tis reſtorative. They value not red <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> but ſell it at cheap rates to other Parts.</p>
               <p>They have likewiſe abundance of Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by the <hi>Malayans</hi> called <hi>Aliaa,</hi> and by the <hi>Bantamites Gauti;</hi> but they either eat it green in Sauces, or preſerve it, for they never dry it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anacardium</hi> by the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> called <hi>Fava de Malacca,</hi> by reaſon of its like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a Bean, is very common here: and the <hi>Bantamites</hi> take it in Milk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Aſthma,</hi> and the Worms.

               <p>That Wood the <hi>Portugals</hi> call <hi>Pala de Cuebra,</hi> grows there in great abundance. 'Tis white inclining to yellow, hard and

bitter. The <hi>Indians</hi> bruiſe, and take it in Wine or Water againſt burning Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and the ſtinging of Serpents: 'tis ſaid, that for this Cure they are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Creature in ſize and ſhape like our Ferrets, by them called <hi>Quil</hi> or <hi>Quirpela,</hi> which they breed for Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to catch Rats and Mice. This lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Beaſt being a mortal Enemy to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, never meets with any of 'em, but it ſets upon 'em, and being bitten runs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to this Root, which is his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Cure.</p>

                  <hi>Palo d' Aguila,</hi> by Druggiſts called <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Aloes,</hi> by the <hi>Portugueze Palo d' aguila,</hi> and by the <hi>Indians Calamba,</hi> grows in <hi>Java,</hi> but not in ſuch quantity as in <hi>Malacca, Sumatra, Cambaya,</hi> and other places. The Tree is like the Olive tree, only a little bigger. The Wood while green hath no ſcent, but as it drys its odour increaſes. The weightieſt and browneſt is the beſt: its perfection is known by the Oyl that iſſues out of it when it is held to the fire. They make Bands of it, and the <hi>Indians</hi> uſe it to embelliſh their Cabinets; but the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt uſe is for Phyſick, for this Wood bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to Powder, and taken in Broth or Wine, fortifies the Stomach, ſtays Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108700:49"/>
and Cures the Pleuriſie and Bloudy Flux. What the <hi>Portugals</hi> call <hi>Aquila brava,</hi> or wild <hi>Calamba,</hi> is not ſo good as the others, and the <hi>Indians</hi> chiefly uſe it at the Funerals of their <hi>Bramins,</hi> making the fire of it that burns the Corps.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bantam</hi> they ſell alſo ſtore of <hi>Lacque,</hi> whereof they make <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wax, and the Varniſh they lay over ſo many excellent Works in <hi>China, Japan,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the Territories of <hi>Bantam</hi> produce it, but the beſt comes from <hi>Pegu,</hi> where 'tis called <hi>Tieck,</hi> and where great and winged Ants get up the Trees, and ſuck the Gum, which afterwards they lay upon the Boughs as Bees do Honey and Wax. When the Boughs are full, the Owners cut them, ſetting 'em to dry in the Sun till the <hi>Lacque</hi> falls from the Boughs, then they beat it to powder, and give it what colour and form they pleaſe.</p>

               <p>AMong the Creatures, which we ſaid the Land of <hi>Bantam</hi> abounds withal, we mentioned Apes; and it is obſervable, that where there are a great number of theſe Animals, there are very few Crows; for aſſoon as they have built their Neſts, and laid their Eggs, the Apes get upon the Trees, and throw their Eggs to the ground: I do not know whether it be to ſee, if they can fly or no. As I was one day travelling along the Road in a Coach, attended with a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108700:51"/>
great many, we ſaw a vaſt number of Monkeys Males and Females, and many of the Females holding young ones in their Arms: Having a deſire to ſhoot at one, I took a Harquebuſs, and kill'd a Female Monkey, who lay ſtretched out upon the Boughs, letting her little one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all to the ground. But immediately all the Monkeys that were upon the Trees, to the number of ſixty, came down in a great fury to have leap'd into our Coach, where they would ſoon have ſtrangled us, had we not prevented them by clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Shutters; and had we not had a great number of Men, who with much ado kept them off; yet they purſued our Coach above a League, and were ſtout luſty Monkeys. In ſeveral parts of this Country there are particular Hoſpitals for theſe Creatures. On the ways there are commonly Copſes of <hi>Bamboos</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very high; ſome of theſe are ſo thick, that it is impoſſible for a Man to get into 'em; but they are peſtered with prodigious numbers of Apes. Thoſe that breed in the Copſes upon one ſide of the way, are enemies to them that are bred on the other ſide; ſo that they dare not croſs from one ſide to the other, but they are in danger of being immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108700:51"/>
ſtrangled. Here the Travellers have good ſport by ſetting the Apes together by the ears, which is done after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; In ſeveral parts of the Road there is Rice to be ſold, and they that would ſee the ſport, cauſe five or ſix Baskets of Rice to be ſet in the Road, ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or fifty paces the one from the other, and cloſe by every Basket they lay five or ſix Botoons about two foot long, and two inches about; then they retire and hide themſelves: preſently they ſhall ſee the Apes on both ſides of the way, deſcend from the tops of the <hi>Bamboos,</hi> and advance towards the Baskets which are full of Rice; They are about half an hour ſhewing their Teeth at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before they come near the Baskets; ſometimes they advance, then retreat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, being Ioath to encounter. At length the Female Baboons, who are more eager and couragious than the Males, eſpecially they that have young ones, which they carry in their Arms as Women do their Children, venture to approach the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; and as they are about to put in their hands to eat, the Males on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide advance to hinder 'em. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the other Party comes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and thus the feud being kindled
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108700:52"/>
on both ſides, they take up the Battoons, that lie by the Baskets, and thraſh one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in good earneſt. The weakeſt are conſtrained to fly into the Woods with their Pates broken, and their Limbs maimed, while the Maſters of the Field glut themſelves with Rice, and the joys of Victory, tho it may be when their Bellies are full, they will ſuffer ſome of the Female Party to come along with 'em.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Elephants,</hi> I happened to ſee two that were lately taken. Each of them was placed between two Tame ones. Round about the wild Elephants ſtood ſix Men, with every one a Half Pike in their Hands, and a lighted Torch faſtened at the end of a Pike; who talkt to the Beaſts, giving them Meat, and crying out in their Language, <hi>Take, eat it.</hi> The food which they gave 'em was a little Bottle of Hay, ſome pieces of brown Sugar, and Rice boiled in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with ſome few Corns of Pepper. If the wild Elephants refuſed to do as they were bidden, the Men made Signs to the Tame Elephant to beat 'em, which they did, banging the Refractory Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant upon the Head and Forehead with their Trunks; and if he offered to make
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108700:52"/>
any ſtir or reſiſtance, the other Elephant thwack'd him moſt unmercifully on the other ſide; ſo that the poor <hi>Elephant</hi> not knowing what to do, was conſtrained to learn obedience.</p>
               <p>Being thus fallen into the Story of <hi>Elephants,</hi> I will add ſome other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, which I have made upon the nature of theſe Creatures. Though the <hi>Elephant</hi> never meddles with the Female after he is once taken, yet he is ſometimes ſeized with a kind of luſtful Rage. One day that the King was Hunting upon an <hi>Elephant,</hi> with one of his Sons that ſate by him to fan him, the <hi>Elephant</hi> became ſo furious by reaſon of his Luſt, that the <hi>Governour</hi> who was by no means able to maſter or rule him, declared to the King, that to allay the fury of the <hi>Elephant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> who would doubtleſs bruiſe him to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among the Trees, there was no way but for one of the three to forfeit his Life, and that he would willingly ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his for the ſafety of the King, and the Prince his Son; only he deſir'd His Majeſty to take care of the three ſmall Children which he muſt leave behind him. Having ſo ſaid, he threw himſelf under the <hi>Elephants</hi> Feet, who had no ſooner taken him in his Trunk, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108700:53"/>
ſqueez'd him to pieces with his feet, but he grew quiet and peaceable as before. The King as an acknowledgment of ſo ſignal a deliverance, gave to the poor Widow 200000 <hi>Roopies,</hi> and highly advanc'd every one of his Sons, that had ſo generouſly laid down his life for the ſafety of the Father of his Country.</p>
               <p>I obſerved alſo, that tho the <hi>Elephants</hi> skin be very hard whilſt he is alive, yet when he is dead the skin is juſt like melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Glew.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral Parks that are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled with nothing but <hi>Elephants</hi> Teeth, the leaſt of which Parks is above a League about. In ſome places they Hunt the <hi>Elephants,</hi> and eat the Fleſh; but they are obliged to give the Tuſhes of every one they kill to the Lord of the place. When they intend to take their <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,</hi> they make a long Lane clos'd in on both ſides, ſo as the <hi>Elephant</hi> can run neither to the right nor to the left. This Lane is broad at the firſt, but grows narrower and narrower, till there is no more Room left at the further end, than for the Female <hi>Elephant</hi> to lie down, which muſt be one that is deſirous of the Male at the ſame time. Tho ſhe be tame, yet ſhe is bound with good Ropes and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108700:53"/>
Cords, and by her Cries will call the Male, who preſently runs through the Lane towards her. Now when the <hi>Elephant</hi> comes where the Lane grows narrow, they that lie hid for that purpoſe, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately barricado up the Lane behind; and when he comes near the Female, then is another barricado ſet up, that ſtops him from going any further. When he is thus between the Barricadoes, they ſo entangle his Legs and Trunk with Ropes and Cords, that he is ſoon taken, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no way to help himſelf. The ſame way they uſe for the moſt part in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>Pegu;</hi> onely that the Natives there mount the Female <hi>Elephant,</hi> and go to find out the Male in the Foreſts; and when they have met with his haunt, they tie the Female to the moſt convenient place they can find, and then they fix their Snares for the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> who in a ſhort time haſtens to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Female hot for generation, where her Cries call him.</p>
               <p>This is obſervable of the Female, that when ſhe begins to be hot, ſhe gathers together a great heap of Herbs and Weeds, and makes her ſelf a kind of Bed ſome four or five foot high from the ground, where contrary to the Cuſtom
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108700:54"/>
of all other Creatures ſhe lies upon her back in expectation of the Male, whom ſhe calls to her by a peculiar Cry.</p>
               <p>This is furthermore particular to the <hi>Elephant</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> that only the firſt, which the Female brings forth has Tuſhes. And it is alſo obſervable, that the Ivory which comes from <hi>Achem,</hi> when it is wrought has this peculiar quality with it, that it never grows yellow, like that which comes out of the Continent, and from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which makes it more eſteemed and dearer than any other.</p>
               <p>When the Merchants bring <hi>Elephants</hi> to any place to ſell, 'tis a pleaſant ſight to ſee 'em go along; for in regard there are generally old and young together, when the old ones are gone by, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will be running after the little ones to play with 'em, and give 'em ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other to eat. While the young <hi>Elephants</hi> (which are very wanton) are buſily taking what is offered them, the Children leap upon their Back; but then the young Elephants, that lately ſtopt for the lucre of Victuals, perceiving their D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ms a great way before 'em, double their pace, and playing with their Trunks,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108700:54"/>
throw the Children off their backs to the ground, and that without doing 'em any harm.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all the Inquiry I have made, I could never find exactly how long the <hi>Elephant</hi> will live; nor can all the Governours and Keepers of thoſe Creatures tell you more, than that ſuch an Elephant has been in the poſſeſſion of their Father, Grandfather, and Great Grandfather: and by that computation I have found, that they have liv'd ſome of 'em ſix ſcore, or an Hundred and Thirty Years.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Javians</hi> making their benefit of the <hi>Portugals</hi> Ingratitude to the <hi>Indian</hi> Princes, who entertained 'em, did perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly oppoſe the eſtabliſhment of any ſtrangers in the Iſle. But the profit the Kings of <hi>Bantam</hi> and <hi>Jacatra</hi> receive by vending their Spices to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> was ſo conſiderable, that at laſt they conſented, that the People of thoſe two Nations ſhould build a Houſe for ſuch Factors, as they ſhould have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to leave there, and for ſtowing up the Commodities they traffiqu'd in. The <hi>Dutch</hi> by Treaty with thoſe Kings, regulated the Cuſtoms of Importation and Exportation; but thoſe Articles
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108700:55"/>
were ſo ill kept by the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings, who raiſed their Rates according as they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſtrangers neceſſity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; that the <hi>Dutch</hi> to avoid this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and ſecure 'emſelves from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> by degrees ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly fortified their Quarters at <hi>Jaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> and in a ſhort time made it defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The <hi>Indians</hi> perceived it not, till 'twas paſt their hopes of forcing it; ſo as in this deſpair of driving out the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they made uſe of the bad Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and them, which chiefly appeared in a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight they had near <hi>Bantam</hi> and <hi>Jacatra, June</hi> 2. 1619. the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet being put to Flight by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> being forced to retreat, the King of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catra</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, beſieged the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fort, now called <hi>Batavia,</hi> which Siege laſted ſix Moneths, till the <hi>Holland</hi> Admiral having reinforced his Fleet with the Ships that lay in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucques,</hi> conſtrained the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to raiſe the Sieg, to embarque their Guns, and quit the Streight of <hi>Sundy,</hi> to get into the main Sea. The King of <hi>Jacatra</hi> would have caſt the blame of all theſe diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but the <hi>Dutch</hi> General would not be ſatisfied with ſuch
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108700:55"/>
excuſes, but landing his Forces, to the number of Eleven Hundred Men, he aſſaulted the Town of <hi>Jacatra,</hi> which he took by force, and having put all to the Sword, fir'd it. That done, the <hi>Dutch</hi> compleated the Fortification of their Quarters, and brought it to a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar form, with four Baſtions of Free-ſtone, well Trench'd and Pallizado'd, with Half Moons, Redoubts, and other neceſſary works. The King of <hi>Matram,</hi> who is (as it were) Emperour of <hi>Java,</hi> in the Year 1628. beſieged this Fort, and lying under the Canon ſtorm'd it ſeveral times; but in the end was forc'd to raiſe the Siege, as he in like manner was the Year following; and ſince that time the <hi>Dutch</hi> have eſtabliſhed their Commerce joyntly with the <hi>Chineſes, Siameſes, Succadans,</hi> and other Neighbours, taking Ten in the Hundred Cuſtom upon all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, whether imported or exported thence.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Batavia</hi> is twelve Leagues from <hi>Bantam,</hi> Eaſtward in a Bay, which being ſheltered with ſome ſmall Iſlands on the Sea-ſide, is one of the beſt Roads in all the <hi>Indies.</hi> Strangers that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit there pay a certain Tax by the Moneth, according to the profits they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108700:56"/>
make, which is great; for a Porter who will with eaſe get two Royals a day, pays but one and a half in a Moneth; a Fruiterer four Royals, a Fiſherman three Royals, Diſtillers of <hi>Arach</hi> eight Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; Mechanicks, as Shoomakers, Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and the like, ſo as at preſent 'tis the moſt important place and firm eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment the <hi>Dutch</hi> have throughout the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after my return from <hi>Bantam</hi> to <hi>Batavia,</hi> I was drawn out amongſt others to be ſent to <hi>Siam,</hi> where we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſafely. That Kingdom extends not onely in the <hi>Peninſula,</hi> beyond the <hi>Ganges</hi> as far as <hi>Cape ſin Capare;</hi> but it likewiſe comprehends the Kingdom of <hi>Martaban,</hi> which is upon the Gulph of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and that of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> upon the Gulph of <hi>Siam;</hi> it is ſituated in the moſt Eaſtern part of all the <hi>Indies,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains abut 360 Leagues from the <hi>South</hi> to the <hi>North,</hi> and about 200 in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt extent from Eaſt to Weſt above the <hi>Peninſula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be divided into four or five principal parts; that which is above the <hi>Peninſula,</hi> in the midſt of the others, is particularly the Kingdom of <hi>Siam.</hi> On its Weſt is that of <hi>Martaban,</hi> on the Eaſt

                  <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and <hi>Maluca</hi> on the South<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Iſland formerly contained ſeveral Kingdoms, that are at preſent reduced into Provinces, the Princes whereof are Subjects and Tributaries of the King of <hi>Siam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very pleaſant and fruitful is this Country, being watered with ſeveral great Rivers, the principal of which is called <hi>Menan,</hi> which after having Bathed <hi>Prom, Travai,</hi> and <hi>Brema,</hi> Cities of <hi>Ava</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> enters into that of <hi>Siam,</hi> paſſing thorough <hi>India</hi> the Capital thereof. This River is ſo deep, that it can carry Ships of four Hundred Tun, and which take Twelve or Thirteen Foot Water; and it might bear thoſe that draw as much more, were it not that at its mouth there is a Rock, which fills the bottom near which you are to paſs, and hinders great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Veſſels from coming in. Its breadth near the City, and for two Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, is two Bow-ſhoot, which renders the unlading of Commodities ſo much the more eaſie. Every where elſe its Banks are a good Muſquet ſhot diſtance one from another. From the City to thirty Leagues beyond it 'tis all along be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with Gardens, Burroughs, Villages, Monaſteries, and other very fine glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108700:57"/>
Buildings, the ſight of which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely charming. And what exalts their beauty, is that inſtead of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, we ſee nothing in all that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which is plain and even, but Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Pyramids, which have ſomething very ſingular both for Art and Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.</p>
               <p>Eight Leagues from the City ſtands another called <hi>Bancock,</hi> where all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Ships, of what Nation ſoever they be, are obliged to ſtop to declare from whence they come, whither they go, what is their <hi>Cargo?</hi> and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men they have on Board? after which they pay the Cuſtoms, for which the Toll-man gives an Acquittance, which they are obliged to ſhew to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little City, called <hi>Canon Bantenau,</hi> which is but a League from <hi>India;</hi> and in caſe it be without deceit, they are permitted to go whither they pleaſe, and to trade freely through all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, without being obliged to pay any other Cuſtoms than thoſe of going out, which every Ship is to pay upon pain of Confiſcation. As for <hi>India,</hi> which, as I have ſaid, is the Capital of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, 'tis without contradiction, one of the fineſt things that can be ſeen. Its

Ramparts are about three fathoms in height, with Baſtions of all ſorts, for there are both ſolid, plain and cut. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable are its Buildings, but eſpecially the Temples, the Monaſteries, and gilt Towers, are there of an unexpreſſible Richneſs and Ornament. The River <hi>Menan</hi> does there run into eight parts, which after having formed two Iſlands, diſcharges it ſelf into the Gulph of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi> The Kings Palace is of ſo vaſt an extent, that one would take it for a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The Air is very temperate, conſidering its being ſo near the Line, (for it is but fifteen degrees diſtant) perhaps by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the narrowneſs of the Country, which is refreſhed by Winds. The Soil is fat, and very fruitful in Rice, Barley, and Fruits. They gather there a great quantity of Pepper, Benjamin, Musk and Aloes. There are Mines of Gold, Silver, Copper, Pewter, and other Metals. It
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108700:58"/>
breeds a great number of <hi>Elephants</hi> and Horſes. There are great Foreſts towards <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> which ſerve for retreats to Tygers, Lions, Leopards, and other ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Beaſts, and for Veniſon; but the number of Red and Fallow Deer is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, ſince that there is carried eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year to <hi>Japan,</hi> above Three Hundred Thouſand Skins of thoſe Creatures, wherein the Company have a good ſhare.

The Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wants not Fiſh, but above all they make a great Trade of the Skins of Thornback, the moſt part of which are ſold in <hi>Japan,</hi> where they are worth fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſixty, and ſome an Hundred Ducats a piece. I have ſeen one ſold for an Hundred Crowns; and that was no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary rate, yet they would not give five Pence for one that has the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

               <p>This Country was always governed by a King or an Emperour, to whom His Subjects pay a kind of Adoration.

               <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> tho vaſt, yet is Populous, proportionably to its greatneſs. The Natives are good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd, witty and induſtrious. All the Artificers are very dexterous; and tho they be of all ſorts, moſt part of 'em however are either Fiſhermen or Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, becauſe very few but have their Lands in Property, or certain Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Rivers and other Waters, where
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108700:59"/>
they have Right of Fiſhing, which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them for their ſubſiſtence. For Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and Ambition are no Vices of this Country; the Abundance being ſo great, that moſtly the day-labouring People have but three Pence a day for their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and pains, on which they live very handſomly, and have beſides ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lay up.

               <p>In each City is a Sovereign Court, whoſe Preſident, that is Triennial, being aſſiſted with his Counſellours, ſits as Judge in all Cauſes both Civil and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.

There is no Court more <hi>ſuperb</hi> than that of this Emperour. He never goes on foot, no, not in his own Palace, where he cauſes himſelf to be carried from one place to another in a Chair of Maſſie Gold. The greateſt Lords of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, who are obliged to follow him at all hours, and at all times, however ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee him more than once a day; and that too with ſo much Pomp and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, that he dazles all thoſe who look on him. When one of theſe great Men is deſirous to ſpeak to him, he approaches him with his Knees upon the ground, his Hands joyned, his Head bowed down, and begins and ends his Speech with theſe words, <hi>Javva Fiauw Perre Bonde, Tiauw Javva;</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> His Throne, which is of Maſſie Gold, and all beſt with Precious Stones, is raiſed very high from the ground; he mounts it by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſteps of the ſame Metal, but 'tis a Crime to ſee him mount it, and every ſtep at both ends ſupports an <hi>Animal</hi> of different kind, and of fine Gold. When he goes out of His Palace, whether out of Devotion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or for Pleaſure, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens two or three times in the Year, he is attended by the greateſt Princes of His
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108700:60"/>
Empire, by His Wives and Concubines, who are in great numbers all very rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clothed, by Land upon <hi>Elephants,</hi> and by Water in Barges all guilt without and within. From the Palace to the place where the Emperour goes, the Life-Guard ſtands in a row on each ſide, all well apparelled and mounted to advantage; principally the chief Officers, who are upon <hi>Elephants,</hi> whoſe Houſes are of Gold and Silver. All along the way nothing is to be heard but Fifes, Drums, Flutes, and other Inſtruments, which make a paſſable Harmony. And aſſoon as the Emperour appears, every one upon pain of Death is obliged to come out before him, proſtrate 'emſelves, and adore him: wherein they are ſo rigorous, that if one waits never ſo little to acquit himſelf of this <hi>Devoir,</hi> he is puniſhed at that inſtant, which I have ſeen with my own eyes. This Cuſtom is quite contrary to what is practiſed in <hi>Peru;</hi> for in all places where the King goes with his Wives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, the People muſt ſhut their Doors and Windows, and remain as in Priſon until all is gone by. Thoſe who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be in the Emperours way, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to diſlodge, and make way for His Attendants; which often occaſions

people to die of Hunger and Cold; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when the Order comes by night, thoſe who give it being ſo punctual, or rather ſo hard-hearted, as they force o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, without giving the People time to provide themſelves with Clothes and Food.

               <p>Gold is ſo common in this Court, that their Cattle are ſerved in Veſſels of no other Metal. The <hi>Elephants,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the White Ones, are there treated like Princes; and of this laſt ſort there is always one in ſo great Veneration, that they attribute to his preſence the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Empire. Thoſe Creatures have in all times ſerved for a pretext to Wars of long continuance betwixt the Neighbouring Kings; for beſides, that they are rarely of that colour, they reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence 'em in memory of <hi>Xaca,</hi> whoſe Mother being with Child of him, once dream't, that a <hi>White Elephant</hi> came out of her mouth, and at another time out of her left ſide.</p>

It was upon the account of theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, that in the Year 1548, the Kings of <hi>Ava</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> made a League againſt the Emperour of <hi>Siam,</hi> in whoſe Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories they had made a great Progreſs, before he was in a condition to reſiſt 'em.

Thoſe who thought to have ſurprized him, ſeeing ſo ſtrong a Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er oppoſed to their Deſign, made ſhew of preparing 'emſelves for a Battel; but whether their Forces were unequal, or they began to abate in their good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence among 'emſelves, three Moneths paſſed without making any attempt; at the end of which thoſe Kings ſeeing their Armies periſh for want of Victuals, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the ground, and left by that means the Emperour of <hi>Siam</hi> the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſſeſſour of the two <hi>White Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,</hi> which they pretended to ſeize on. What at firſt delayed his March, was, that he had neither Souldiers nor Ships to go to the place, where he was to joyn the Enemy; and he cauſed above Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand Veſſels to be built, which required ſome time. Beſides the two
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108700:61"/>
Hundred Thouſand Men which he brought with him, he left upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers Fifty Thouſand Citizens, who were obliged to guard 'em at their own coſts. Some were amazed, he did not take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of His Enemies weakneſs; but he ſaid, <hi>That he had gained more by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying them after that manner, than if he had conſtrained 'em to end the quarrel by a Battel, the iſſue whereof was uncertain.</hi> He pretended to have conquered 'em more cunningly, and more happily for His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whoſe Lives and Eſtates he preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without coſting 'em one drop of bloud. So that he was received in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in His <hi>Metropolis,</hi> as if he had made the greateſt Conqueſts. After the death of the King, if he has left no Male Infant, or his Son has not attained the Age of 15 Years, this Son loſes His Right to the Crown, to which the eldeſt Brother of the deceaſed becomes the Legitimate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. And as for the Offices poſſeſſed by the Grandees of the Court, they are all Hereditary, at leaſt if he who enjoys 'em does not oblige the Prince to declare his Heir uncapable of ſucceeding him.</p>

The greateſt Expence of this Prince is the great number of Pagods, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, Hoſpitals and Towers, which he cauſes inceſſantly to be built, and what it coſts him in raiſing 'em, does ſurpaſs the <hi>Idea</hi> People have conceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. After having applied Himſelf to what concerns Religion, he takes care His Arſenals be largely provided with all that is requiſite for War: and indeed all things there are in a ſurpriſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and ſo neatly kept, that it would be very difficult to imitate them therein.</p>
               <p>As for His Forces, they conſiſt almoſt all in Infantry, which is very good; the Pay of the Souldiers is but a little Rice; the reſt they have occaſion for, they are to gain it from the Enemy, or by labouring very hard at any kind of Work, for they are treated as Slaves, and they give a blind Obedience to whatſoever they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>As for the Citizens, their condition is little better than that of the Souldiers; for, beſides the Subſidies with which they are exceſſively oppreſſed, and that they have nothing in Propriety: they are obliged to work on the Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to work as well as the Souldiers
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108700:63"/>
in occaſions of neceſſity. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, they are ſo ſupple, and ſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable, that they are never heard to complain or murmur: tho the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſevere, they live contented and happy, becauſe they deſire nothing. From that ſoft and tractable Humour, they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily proceed to Devotion, which is as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to 'em; and whether they are little addicted to Riches, whereof they have only the uſe, and not the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or they think 'em unworthy of their Affection, they employ 'em almoſt all in Alms, which they beſtow upon the <hi>Bonzes,</hi> who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The great eſteem the People have for 'em, cauſes 'em to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply more than can be imagined; theſe Prieſts affect a fine out-ſide, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty which ſavours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108700:63"/>
dearer than their Lives, they only think of advancing themſelves, inſomuch that there has been thoſe found, who have made ſecret Cabals for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning the King, for to Reign in His place.</p>
               <p>Theſe good People are clothed in yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and every New Moon they have their Heads, Beards and Eye brows ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. They neither wear Gold nor Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and dare not ſo much as touch it, but they receive and diſpence it by a <hi>Procurator,</hi> that is to ſay, by the Hands of a Man of an approved Fidelity, and who Honours the Secrets of the Order, but pretends to ſee nothing. They make a Vow of Chaſtity, and ſeem to keep it very rigorouſly; but they ſee Women in private, and provided there reſults no ſcandal from that Commerce, they make little ſcruple on't<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if it comes to light, the Criminal is puniſhed very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely. Bating this, they lead a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious life, exempt from all care; for as they want nothing, and they have not ſo much as the care of heaping up Riches, which ſhower down upon 'em, without ſpending their thoughts in that way, they have nothing more to do than to ſtudy, how to entertain their Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108700:64"/>
in the good intention they have of nouriſhing 'em in a Heavenly Idleneſs. Their Rule obliges 'em to preach to the People every Quarter of the Moon, to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſe at all times, and to induce 'em to Peace. The great Modeſty which they affect in their Pious Exerciſes, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to their Houſes all the People, who in acknowledgment of the ſpiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which the Monks communicate to 'em, beſtow upon 'em ſuch as are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and that even to profuſion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four a clock in the Morning, they riſe at the ringing of the Bells, and go all together to a certain place appointed for Prayer; part of the day is ſpent in viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſick; in the Evening they return to Prayers, where they remember the dead, for they believe that their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers contribute very much towards their comfort and eaſe, and for the freeing 'em from an imaginary Place, where (they ſay) they endure great Pains.</p>
               <p>They have an infinite number of Idols, who repreſent ſeveral poſtures of Men and Women, moſt being of Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſome of Copper and Pewter, and very few of Stone or Wood. In the great Pagod, where the King goes once a year, there is one, who tho ſeated with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108700:64"/>
Legs acroſs, is about ſixty foot high; the others are much richer, but not ſo great. Thoſe of the Altars are much the fineſt, but their Beauty is not in the leaſt to be compared with the Idols of the Pagod, which is in the midſt of the City; where of four Thouſand which it contains, there is not one but what is either of Gold or Gilt. As for their Ceremonies, they are in many things conformable to thoſe of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who its eaſie to prove, have ſuck'd moſt of their Superſtition from <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> for at the Entrance of their Pagods, there is Holy Water; and without ſpeaking of their Altars, that are loaded with Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Idols, there are Lamps always burning, a number of other Lights, and every where Boxes to receive the Alms of Pilgrims. The Works of <hi>Supererogation</hi> are in great Credit amongſt 'em; and if we would believe 'em, there is not a dead Perſon, but whom their Prayers are a great help to, nor any living, but to whom they are conſiderably uſeful. Tho the <hi>Indians,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Bonzes,</hi> have commonly a blind averſion to thoſe who are of a contrary Religion to theirs, theſe People ſeem very moderate in that reſpect, and far from being paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108700:65"/>
When we repreſent to 'em the Vanity of the Gods they adore, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer modeſtly, proteſt they ſearch for the Truth, and if they knew a better way to attain it, they would quit all to purſue it. I have heard one of thoſe <hi>Banzes</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> after them were the moſt beloved by God, and the nigheſt to Salvation. <hi>I eſteem them</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſo much the more, in that they ſeem to love Juſtice, Probity and Sincerity; becauſe th y leave the Conſcience free, and do not traduce us, at leaſt in our preſence, as the</hi> Mahometans <hi>do, who cannot ſuffer thoſe, who are not of their belief. A pride which we deteſt, and which binders us from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Converſion, as we do for the Chriſtians, whoſe God is the Brother of our God.</hi>

               <p>NOthing is wanting in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of things neceſſary for the Structure of all ſorts of Buildings, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it abounds in very fine Stones, and yet the Houſes there are only of Wood:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:108700:65"/>
the reaſon of it is, that the Stones are reſerved for the building both the <hi>Pagods</hi> and <hi>Pyramids,</hi> whereof there is a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious number through all the Country, Stools, Chairs and Tables are of no uſe there, and the <hi>Siamites</hi> as well as all the other <hi>Orientals,</hi> ſit in all occaſions, only upon Mats or Carpets. All their Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, which conſiſt in ſome Utenſils of the Kitchin, are of Braſs, always very bright and very neat; their Houſes are ſo clean and neat, that they far exceed <hi>Holland</hi> in that; and as for their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they waſh their Bodies three times a day from Head to Foot, in the cleareſt Fountain water that can be found; then they rub 'emſelves with a Perfume com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Sandal Wood, Aloes, Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece, Roſe-Water, Musk, and ſuch like things, whoſe Odour is very agreeable; wherein they take a much better courſe than the <hi>Javans,</hi> who perfume 'emſelves with a Drug that is inſupportable to thoſe that are nice in the leaſt. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is forthwith after thoſe Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that they make their Viſits and their Devotions, but they firſt deck 'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all their fineries; thoſe of the Men conſiſting in a number of Gold-Rings, and a long Veſt of Cotton-ſtuff,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108700:66"/>
upon which they have a Saſh of ſeveral colours, and under, a very looſe ſhirt of Linnen or Cotton, which is ſometimes red, ſometimes white, or of another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The Sleeves of their Veſts are very large, moſt of 'em open about the Elbow, and hanging to the Knees, but they go almoſt bare-headed, and without ſhooes.</p>
               <p>The Women make a round of their Hair, which they faſten behind their Head with a Bodkin. Their Pendants are of blades of Gold, of a Fingers length, which are inchaſed with ſome Jewels; thoſe blades are ſo maſſie, that the weight of them makes holes in their Ears big enough to put a Thumb through. Their Bracelets are likewiſe of Gold and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones, and they have very fine Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds upon their Fingers. As for their Habits, they are of Cotton, as well as thoſe of the Men, and made much after the ſame manner; except that they have upon their Boſoms a Veil of Linnen or Silk, the colour of which is Arbitrary, and the form ſomething reſembles the Scarfs Women wear in <hi>England.</hi> The Complexion of both Sexes is Tawny; they are Tall of Stature, but well ſet, and of a Free Carriage, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108700:66"/>
the People there are good natur'd and polite.</p>
               <p>Tho the young Men and Maids ſee one another with liberty enough, and it is no Scandal for the latter to grant ſometimes Favours, they live in Marriage with ſo much reſervedneſs, that there is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the Women have more: Not that they are all perhaps ſo many <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretiaes,</hi> but as Adultery is there ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed, the fear of Puniſhment is capable of rendring 'em diſcreet. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Mothers forbid their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters when they are young, too great a Commerce with Men, for fear <hi>of getting an ill Habit;</hi> or perhaps too, for fear that the Men ſhould not be ſo eager to court 'em by way of Marriage. This Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance makes the Maids, who have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be Married, of difficult acceſs; and the more they conceal 'emſelves, the more do their Lovers crowd after 'em. The means to obtain 'em is, to addreſs ones ſelf to the Parents, who, without conſulting their Daughters Inclinations, grant her to the Man, who pleaſes 'em moſt, provided he be of the Kindred; for it is the Cuſtom of the <hi>Siamites,</hi> to ally 'emſelves only in their own Family, where all Alliance is permitted, except
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108700:67"/>
between Brother and Siſter; nay, and theſe may Marry together, in caſe they be but Half-Brothers and Half-Siſters; that is to ſay, of the ſame Father, and not of the ſame Mother. Thus Intrigues of Gallantry are of no uſe in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſuch an one Marries, who has never ſeen the Perſon ſhe is to wed. As Intereſt reigns there as well as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, they make Alliances commonly in conſideration of Eſtate and Fortune; and when the Match is advantageous, for fear of a diſappointment, the Maids are Married at Nine years, and the Young Men at Twelve; inſomuch as the married Couple do not both make five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, when they find 'emſelves alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Fathers and Mothers. Out of Marriage the Men are permitted to have as many Concubines as they can maintain, and in Marriage, if they have but one Wife, they are free to quit her upon ſlight pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, eſpecially when they have no Children, and then either the one or the other may Marry again when they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Tho the Prieſts are very much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced in that Country, yet there is no reſpect had to 'em in Marriage, and far from calling 'em to be Witneſſes of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108700:67"/>
Union, they are on the contrary avoided, and People take it for an ill <hi>Omen,</hi> that they ſhould be preſent at ſuch a time. He who performs the Ceremony of it, is one of the neareſt Relations, who in the heat of the Feaſt, makes an Exhortation, after his mode, to the new married Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and whether the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom live together until death, or they part, the Clauſes of the Contract of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage are religiouſly obſerved.</p>
               <p>As to the Children, they are brought up with great gentleneſs, and yet they are very ſupple, and do punctually, without any need of uſing rigour, all that is exacted from them. 'Tis uſually the Prieſts, who take care of their Education; and as this ſort of People live happily, their Diſciples obſerving it, turn Prieſts as well as they, for to enjoy the ſame pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Their Cuſtom in regard of the Dead, is to burn them, and to make their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals conformably to their Means, which is performed in the manner following; The Relations of the Defunct raiſe up a Tomb, which they fill with ſweet ſcented Wood, which ſerves to burn the Corps, and whereto the Prieſts ſet fire, after having ſaid Prayers. The
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108700:68"/>
Rich preſerve the Aſhes in Urns of Gold or Silver, or bury 'em under a Pyramid, or in a Pagod, which the Deceaſed has cauſed to be built; for there is not a rich <hi>Siamite,</hi> but who is at that expence to eternize his Memory. The Aſhes of the Poor are caſt into the Wind. Thoſe who die naked of all, through an exceſs of Charity, that is to ſay, for having ſpent what they had of Value in building Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries or <hi>Pagods,</hi> thoſe I ſay, are burnt at the expence of the Prieſts and Monks, who have profited thereby, for which reaſon the Pomp is very ſmall. As for Criminals and Children, who end their Lives, thoſe by a Criminal, theſe by an untimely death, their bodies are not burnt, but they inter 'em, it not being reaſonable, that they who have lived without honour, or died before they attained to the Knowledge of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Gods, ſhould enjoy the Honours and Priviledges of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>The Civility of the <hi>Siamites</hi> extends even to Strangers, and of what Nation ſoever a Man be, he is favourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there. What contributes to this good Reception is, that the more Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers there be there, the more are the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108700:68"/>
of the Country eſteemed by the Neighbouring States; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is forbidden to trouble them in any kind, whether in the courſe of their Trade, or Cuſtoms, or in the exerciſe of their Religion. True it is however, that there are ſome who are priviledged; and of all thoſe who frequent there, none are ſo well received as the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to whom the King has been particularly kind, as well in their Trade as Impoſts; and even contrary to his Cuſtom, which is to ſee no Foreigners, he gives 'em Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in His Palaces, and calls 'em, <hi>His Children.</hi>

Since we have had the Honour of having

Acceſs into His Palace, he has heaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us new kindneſſes; and that which he did in permitting us to aſſiſt at the Funerals of his only Daughter, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one of the greateſt that Strangers can receive. This Princeſs being deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at my firſt arrival there, ſix Moneths afterwards the King ſent word to the <hi>Sieur van Muyden</hi> Principal Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Company, that he had leave given him to be preſent at the Obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. <hi>Van Muyden</hi> received with all due reſpect the Honour the King did him: and thus, with ſome others, of which number I was, he was Spectatour of a Ceremony which merited well to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>Preparations were made for that Pomp in one of the Courts of that Palace, where there were raiſed five Towers of Wood; whereof that in the midſt was about an Hundred and twenty Foot in Height, the others diminiſhing by the ſame degrees they ſtood at a diſtance from that. Thoſe Towers were painted and gilt, and had communication by Galleries, with Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſters enriched with the ſame Ornaments. Before the higheſt of thoſe Towers, the Body of the Defunct, was repoſed upon an Altar, all covered with Gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108700:69"/>
Stones; ſhe was ſtanding, her Hands joyned, her Face turn'd towards Heaven, in a Coffin of Gold an inch thick. Her Robe had a long Train, and was all beſet with Jewels; her Crown, her Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and her Bracelets likewiſe, all over covered with Diamonds, were of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable price. When every one had taken places upon Scaffolds made on purpoſe, all the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the Kingdom went to make their Bows to her. The Ladies came thither afterwards, and both Sexes were only apparell'd with a white Cloth, without any Attire or Ornament; each one ſcattering round the Body and the Altar Flowers and Perfumes, with a very ſad Countenance. After which, the Body was carried twenty paces from thence in a Chariot, the riches whereof equalled that of the Altar. The Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the Kingdom, and the Ladies, having paid her the ſame Honours, they all wept bitterly, and after ſo mournful a manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it ſeemed as if they had loſt what they had deareſt in the world. Theſe Tears and Lamentations having laſted for half an hour, the Principal Officers of the Crown drew the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot very gently towards the place where the Funeral Pile was.

At half way from the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pile, there were Stages or Scaffolds, where the Lords of leſſer Quality than the former, expected the Convoy. When the Body was come up over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, ſome caſt ſeveral ſorts of Habits to the People; others, Oranges full of Ficols, which makes half a Crown of our Money: and ſome certain pieces

               <p>The Convoy being arrived at the place where the Ceremony was to end, the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the Kingdom took the Body with great Reſpect, and laid it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Funeral Pile, ſeveral Inſtruments in the mean while ſounding, whoſe mournful Harmony, attended with the Tears and Lamentations of all the Court, was capable of ſtaggering the hardeſt Hearts.

               <p>Whilſt the Ladies were weeping round the deceaſed Princeſs, the Prieſts were upon Scaffolds in the Court where the firſt Tears were ſhed, praying Night and day for her Soul: And while the Body was expoſed there, they interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Prayers often, for to caſt to the People Garments of all ſorts, Utenſils for Houſe-keeping, Inſtruments for Artificers, Beds, Mats, and other Moveables.

               <p>THE Body having repoſed two days upon the ſweet ſented Wood, which ſerv'd to burn it, all the Court went to relieve the doleful Ladies, whom their Fatigue had rendred very lean. The Ceremony began with Prayers and Speeches, which the Prieſts made; and when they had done 'em, the King took a lighted Wax-Candle from the Hands of the Arch-Prieſt, and ſet fire himſelf to the Funeral Pile, where the Body was reduced to Aſhes in the Coffin of Gold, wherein they had left the Riches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was adorned. When they thought the Body conſumed, and went to gather up the Aſhes for the putting 'em into an Urn of Gold, there was found a piece of fleſh of the bigneſs of a little Child, ſo fine, and ſo Vermilion-like, that it ſeemed at firſt, as if the Fire had ſpared it out of reſpect; but that thought was followed by another, which occaſioned the ſhedding of a great deal of bloud. The King, who was one of thoſe who gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108700:72"/>
up the Aſhes, looking upon that piece of fleſh, <hi>What do ye think</hi> (ſaid he, to the Lords who were preſent) <hi>is it out of reſpect, the fire has ſpared what remains of the body of my Daughter?</hi> The King waiting their anſwer, one amongſt 'em ſaid, <hi>That His Majeſty had too much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to doubt what he ſaw. How!</hi> (replied the King all in a fury) <hi>I have but too much reaſon not to doubt any longer of a ſuſpicion I have had a hundred times, my Daughter was poiſoned.</hi> In finiſhing thoſe words he gave order they ſhould ſecure all the Women who had ſerv'd the Defunct, and that not one ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>The days following, new ſuſpicions were formed, upon which a number of innocent People were impriſoned: for what tortures ſoever they made them ſuffer, there was not one but diſavowed the Crime. In the mean while the Kings fury daily augmented; all thoſe that were accuſed made appear, they were not culpable: but the Cruelties did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh; and when the Court was drei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the King no longer found any one upon whom to diſcharge his Anger, he ſent upon divers pretexts, for the greateſt Men of the Kingdom, and their
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:108700:73"/>
Wives, whom he cauſed to be put in Priſon as ſoon as they arrived at Court. When he had 'em in his power, he cauſed ſeveral holes to be digged round the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, about twenty Foot ſquare, wherein great Fires were kindled, guarded by Souldiers, who took care to hinder 'em from going out. And thither he ſent the Priſoners, loaded with Chains, to the end he might draw from 'em by force what Threatnings and Promiſes had not been able to make 'em confeſs. When they were at the place of Puniſhment, it was begun with making 'em enter into a Tub of hot water for to ſoften their skin, and render it more ſuſceptible of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Fire. After which they ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Soles of their Feet with Irons as ſharp as Knives; then carried 'em before Judges, who examined 'em concerning the pretended buſineſs of poyſoning; thoſe who continued obſtinate to deny that they were culpable of it, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to walk bare footed upon burning Coals; and if it was found afterwards that the Fire had penetrated 'em, it was a convicting proof, they were guilty of the fact whereof they had bin accuſed. An Errour which in all times has been entertained among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108700:73"/>
made uſe of Fire for the trying of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals; Witneſs the <hi>Roman Veſtals,</hi> who only proved their Chaſtity by graſping a burning Iron, without burning 'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As for the <hi>Siamites</hi> we ſpeak of, they whom the heat of the Fire cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to fall into a Swoun, and who had not Strength enough to get out of 'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, periſhed there miferably, no body daring to to help 'em, for fear of running the ſame danger. Thoſe who eſcaped it, were tyed to a Poſt, from whence an <hi>Elephant</hi> inſtructed in that manner of Death, tore 'em with his Trunk, caſt 'em into the Air, from whence they fell again upon his Teeth, and after ſeveral Toſſes he trod 'em under Foot, and made their Guts come out, which were afterwards caſt into the River. Beſides this hard puniſhment, there was one, that was no leſs to be feared, which was to be Interred all alive unto the Chin, upon the High-way of the City, with obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Paſſengers to ſpit upon 'em, and prohibition to give 'em eaſe in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and even to advance their Deaths, which was the favour thoſe miſerable Wretches demanded with moſt Arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:108700:74"/>
Amongſt other Puniſhments, there was this very remarkable, and which is alſo very frequently executed upon notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Malefactors. The Criminal is bound ſo ſtreight about with a Napkin, that a Man may graſp him with his Hands, and then is pricked with Engines as ſharp as Needles; not only make the bloud guſh out, but force the Patient to hold in his breath. Which taking the opportunity of on a ſudden, they cut him through the middle, and clapping immediately the upper part of his body upon a flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot piece of Braſs, through the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terization of which, he remains a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time alive, in far greater torments than can be imagined.</p>
               <p>Theſe cruel Executions laſted for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four Moneths, during which, they took the Lives away of an incredible Multitude. One day in leſs than four or five Hours, I my ſelf ſaw above fifty put to death. People imagined, that would have been the laſt day of the Maſſacres, becauſe ſome Moneths paſſed afterwards without putting any body to death; but they were quickly diſabuſed. As the Nobility, that were terrified, began to take Heart and return to Court, the Executions were renewed, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108700:74"/>
Heads fell at length, that the flower of the moſt Apparent, whom the King thought ill intentioned to His Perſon and Children, periſhed upon the Pretext of having had a Hand in this Sham-buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Poyſoning, or of having been privy to it. To have ſeen thoſe Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſo viſible an Injuſtice, it was much to be wondered there was no Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and indeed, there has been ſuch for leſs conſiderable Reaſons: but the King had provided againſt that, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on foot a great number of Forces, with which he had filled his beſt Towns, in appearance, for to ſend 'em againſt the <hi>Chinezes,</hi> but indeed to bridle thoſe whom he diſtruſted, while he made ſure of the others. And further, His Hatred did only extend to the Great Men, whoſe Fall the People did joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſee, by reaſon of their Inſolence, and the ill Treatments they received from 'em.</p>
               <p>On the 28 of <hi>February,</hi> they carried three Hundred Perſons, who had ſerved the Defunct Lady to go thro the Fire: but whether it was only a Fire of Straw, or painted, it is ſaid to have ſpared thoſe three Hundred Domeſticks, who by thoſe means were abſolved and releaſed: ſome
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:108700:75"/>
days after one of the deceaſed Kings Daughters was impeached; ſhe was one of the youngeſt of his Children, who was ſuſpected of the Crime then in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, becauſe it had been obſerved, that ſhe laughed when all the others wept at the Obſequies of the Princeſs. They were fortified in this Suſpicion by the Remembrance of the frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ſhe had made of the King, by reaſon he had not Conſideration enough for her, and His Slights were the cauſe, that ſhe was no longer treated as a Kings Daughter, wherein ſhe was in no wiſe inferiour to His other Children who were the Delight and Admiration of the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tho theſe Conjectures were but Half Proofs, yet they were made uſe of for the bringing her to a Tryal; or rather, ſhe was condemned contrary to all forms of Juſtice; for, without hearing her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they cauſed her to paſs thro the Fire, with almoſt all her Attendants: but, as they had only a deſign upon her, a Rumour was ſpread abroad, that it had hurt no body but her; wherefore they loaded her with Chains of Gold in an obſcure place, with prohibition, to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it was, to ſee and ſpeak with</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:108700:75"/>
                  <hi>her. Nothing was now expected but the Hour of that Princeſſes Death, when People learn'd, that the King being mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Compaſſion, deſired nothing more than to ſave her, provided ſhe could juſtifie her ſelf of the Crime, that was imputed unto her in the Preſence of His Counſel. On the day of her Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, inſtead of being terrified at the Torments that were preparing for her, <hi>My Lords,</hi> ſaid ſhe, looking ſcornfully up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Judges,</hi> All in Chains as you ſee me, I am of the Bloud, which you adore in the Perſon of the King, and which you have adored in the Perſon of my Father. 'Tis of the ſame value; 'tis the ſame in my Veins that it is in his; and yet the ſame Bloud is treated in me, as if I was a vile Slave, at the ſame time that Incenſe is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it elſewhere, and they render the ſame Honour as to the Bloud of the Gods. From whence comes this difference, My Lords? Is it, that the Bloud which animates me is corrupted? But whence ſhould that Corruption <note place="margin">Infamous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes among the <hi>Siamites,</hi> and for woh they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>proceed? Thanks to the Gods, I have neither a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nor the Pox; and tho there had been ſomething impure in me, the Fire I have been made to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108700:76"/>
paſs through muſt needs have purged it: but I am ſaid to have taken away my Couſins Life, and by that Action I have degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Dignity of my Anceſtors. I do not examine the Effects of the Crime, whereof I am accuſed, nor if our Actions deface in us a Character, which Nature bath imprinted there; but let us ſee if it be juſt to condemn me without hearing me; the greateſt <hi>Barbarians</hi> take another courſe, and the worſt of Crimes are puniſhed among Them according to the Laws. However, they make a ſcruple of treating me as all the World is treated; I do not deſerve the leaſt regard ſhould be had for me, and upon the leaſt appearances, I muſt be condemned to undergo the ſevereſt Puniſhments. But I laughed, <hi>ſaid they,</hi> inſtead of weeping at the Obſequies of my Couſin, I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the Kings ſlights, How! When were the moſt innocent Actions ever condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Is it ſo culpable a thing to laugh when we are young, and not yet at an Age to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble? And for ſome ſmall Complaints which were none of the worſt grounded, have I merited either Fire or Sword, and ought they to prophane in me the Bloud of a Prince, who never ſought Pretexts to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Yours, under whoſe Reign this Empire has ſo long flouriſhed, and under
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108700:76"/>
whom it would ſtill perhaps have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, if certain ſecret Enemies had not ſnatch'd the Scepter from him by an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is commended in them, becauſe they have had the Happineſs of trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing without Oppoſition, and which is baſely puniſhed in me becauſe I am weak, and all the Authority is in the hands of my Antagoniſt. Thus you ſee, <hi>My Lords,</hi> the Injuſtice of this Procedure; but after the manner I ſpeak thereof, you may very well judge I have no deſire to be ſpared; and indeed, <hi>My Lords,</hi> I hate Life, and ſince the Affront that has been put upon me, I only wiſh for Death; not that I am troubled with the Remorſes of my Conſcience, but becauſe I bluſh to live in ſo ſordid an Age, and I have no Body to help me to repulſe the Blows of a Tyrant, who cannot endure the ſad Reliques of your Kings, Go, <hi>My Lords,</hi> and tell him my Reſolution, and endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it to him after ſuch a manner as may terrifie him in caſe my Death be in the leaſt deferred: This is the only favour I demand of you.</p>

The Princeſſes boldneſs did ſtagger Peoples Minds, and if the King had not foreſeen it by the raiſing of the Forces we have before mentioned, 'tis certain, that there would have bin ſome Revolt; but the fear of the approaching Danger ſtifl'd the grief of the Judges: they made their report of what they had heard, and the King diſſembling the Vexation he had to ſee himſelf braved after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, pretended to have ſome pity, and made her appear before him with an Air, as gave occaſion to believe, he had a deſire to ſave her. <q>Well, ſaid he, to her, at her coming into his Preſence, I hear that Life is grown a burden to you, and it would be in vain for us to endeavourto ſave it; but from whence proceeds that great Averſion to it? Is it not from the Remorſe of having poyſoned my Daughter, or from ſome other yet more violent? for I do not believe you of a humour to confine your ſelf to one Crime: but as wicked as you are, I have no deſire to ſee your Ruine, which it lies only in your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to try, which you may eaſily do by confeſſing your Crimes, and your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices.</q>

                  <q>Do not think, Sir, (replied the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs boldly) I am terrified with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, or your falſe kindneſs is capable of ſurpriſing me. I am in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſpeak to you ſincerely; you have loſt a Daughter, and you will needs have me to be the cauſe of her loſs: Yes, yes, let it be ſo, I confeſs, it was I, who poyſoned her, but I likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow, that this Crime is not ſo great as you make it, or rather that that Victim was too vile to be ſacrificed to my juſt reſentment. 'Tis well known, that it was by your Plots, the Scepter of my Anceſtors fell into your Hands; and by your Order, we are in the duſt: could I do leſs than take Vengeance for ſo conſiderable a loſs, and for a Treatment ſo unworthy the Bloud of ſo many Kings? Wherefore I have ſought to comfort my ſelf in the death of my Enemies; but I have ſo ill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, that I think my ſelf unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Light; and it is for having failed of depriving you of it, that I can no longer endure living. As for my Accomplices, I confeſs with the ſame ſincerity, I have had none of thoſe whom you have ſo cruelly murdered. But why ſhould I tell you what you know,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108700:78"/>
and what no body is ignorant of? No body is ignorant, that you, hated 'em long ſince, you dreaded 'em, and have a long time ſought for a pretext to get rid of 'em; you have found that happy moment, you triumph, you are belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Heaven, enjoy in repoſe the favours which it heaps upon you; and if you have ſtill any humanity left, finiſh what you have begun; for I muſt confeſs, I am weary of breathing the ſame Air that is ſucked by the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner of my bloud, and the baſeſt of all Tyrants.</q>

               <p>The King uſed great violence upon himſelf to ſuffer her ſpeak ſo long, but at length, affecting to appear what he was not, that is to ſay, good natur'd and humane; after having asked her if ſhe had nothing more to ſay, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs making no anſwer, he cauſed a piece of her fleſh to be cut off, which he commanded her to eat; <hi>Content thy ſelf</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him) <hi>with being my Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner; thou mayſt tear my body to pieces, but thou haſt no Power over my Will.</hi> She was going to continue, when the Kings Choler augmenting, ſhe was cut to pieces as ſhe finiſhed theſe words, and caſt into the River.</p>

with an <hi>Holland</hi> Flag, which ſeemed to come directly to us; the more it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, the more did we believe, it was a Pyrate: wherefore for fear of a ſurprize, and to be ſo much the more free in caſe he attaqued us, we were contriving how to caſt ſome Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes into the Sea, when we perceived, it was a Merchant-man. Being delivered from our fears, we called to 'em to come ſhew us their Paſsport, but they excuſed 'emſelves, in that their <hi>Jonc</hi> was in ſo ill a condition, that it ſprung Leaks on all ſides. We armed Seven or Eight of our Men, and put 'em into a Pinnace to go on board of 'em. All the Men on board the <hi>Jonc</hi> were <hi>Chineſes</hi> and <hi>Gambodians;</hi> they had <hi>Sandale</hi> Wood, <hi>Amrac,</hi> and Buck-skins as well as we; but they were moreover freighted with counterband Goods, and had no Paſport, for which reaſon we ſeized upon 'em. Having got all they had on board of us, while the <hi>Jonc</hi> was repairing, we cauſed the <hi>Gambodians</hi> and the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into it, who were expoſed to the Sea without Sails, Maſts and Rudder, that we might be revenged of the Maſſacre which the latter had executed a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon ſome <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:108700:82"/>
On the tenth of <hi>May</hi> being arrived at <hi>Formoſa,</hi> we caſt Anchor before the Fort called <hi>Zelandoia,</hi> from whence preſently after, we ſaw a <hi>Jonc</hi> ſtrike ſo hard upon a Rock, that both it, the Goods, and Men were all caſt away.</p>
               <p>This Iſland is ſituated under the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of Cancer,</hi> at 21 degrees of Southern Latitude, and ending towards the 25<hi>th.</hi> of Northern; its Circuit is 130 Leagues. It abounds in Fiſh of all ſorts, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all they catch a ſort called <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> of the bigneſs of a <hi>Whiting,</hi> which being ſalted and prepared like <hi>Stock fiſh,</hi> is diſtributed thorow all <hi>China,</hi> as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> are in <hi>Europe.</hi> They ſalt appart the Eggs of that Fiſh, which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> make a very ſavoury Diſh of. That Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paid formerly to the <hi>Dutch Eaſt India</hi> Company a certain Impoſt for the fiſhing of this Fiſh, but that Right does no longer ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>Its Soil is very fruitful, but the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants (who are laſie) do not make the beſt advantage on't. It produces Rice, Wheat, Barley, Millet, Ginger, Cinamon, Coco's, Lemons, Oranges, Melons, Gourds, and all ſorts of Pulſe, <hi>Majavinades, Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavas, Cadiany, Potates;</hi> and the <hi>Focu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focoes,</hi> which is a Fruit of the form and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108700:83"/>
bigneſs of a <hi>Bon Chreſtien</hi> Pear. This Fruit is of a Purple colour, and lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground as Melons do, and is of a moſt excellent taſte. There are likewiſe ſome Sheep, but not ſo many as Deer, Goats, Hares, Rabbets, Pidgeons, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Deer, wild Goats, wild Boars, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Bears and Monkeys; beſides a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Animal, called by the <hi>Hollanders, the Devil of Fayovan;</hi> it is about three quarters of a yard in length, and about twenty Inches large; it has Scales like a Fiſh, and very ſharp Claws. It only feeds upon Piſmires, who go of themſelves upon its Tongue, when Hunger preſſes it to put it out. This Creature is very timorous, and eſpecially of Mankind: if it can only ſhun one by hiding it ſelf in the Earth, it makes a hole there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with ſo much ardour, that in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it retrenches it ſelf as in a Fort; or if it be ſurpriſed in ſuch a manner, as that it has not time to get in, it wraps its ſelf up in its Scales, and takes the form of a Ball. Thoſe who have named it <hi>Devil,</hi> muſt needs not have known it, or they were frighted with its Figure; for tho you hurt it never ſo much, it will rather ſuffer it ſelf to be killed than make any Defence. There are no Parrots, but
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108700:83"/>
many other ſorts of Birds, and an infinity of flying Locuſts that are very dangerous and troubleſome.</p>
               <p>The Men are of a low ſtature, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe who inhabit the Mountains; neither are the Women of a larger ſize, moſt of whom have broad Faces, great Eyes, flat Noſes, and full boſomed; and what they have moſt ſingular is, that they have Beards grow upon their Chins as well as Men; and were they not very diligent in pulling it out, they would be much better furniſhed. Add to this beauty very long Ears, which they take great care to lengthen and augment by the weight of certain great Shells, which ſerve 'em inſtead of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. This Ornament ſeems to 'em ſo rare, that the more Solemn the Feaſts are, and of the greater quality the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they ſee, the more they lengthen their Ears, which reach, on thoſe occaſions, down to their very Breaſts, by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weights which they put in 'em. Their Hair is both very black and long; ſome wear it much after the ſame manner as they do in <hi>Holland;</hi> others tye it up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Chineze</hi> manner, or make it into ſeveral Treſſes, which they faſten round behind their Heads with a Tin Bodkin.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108700:84"/>
Their Necklaces are of Glaſs or Stone, and of little pieces of Silver in ſeveral Figures. Their Complexion is yellow and black, and ſome towards <hi>Kubeland</hi> are yellow and white. The Women of <hi>Miday,</hi> whoſe King is Maſter of the greateſt part of the Iſle of <hi>Souten, Norwe</hi> and <hi>Lamei,</hi> are altogether yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. As for the Gifts of Mind, all the Inhabitants in general are pretty well furniſhed.</p>
               <p>The Women are cloathed from the Neck to the Middle with a piece of Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which flys about negligently; and from the Middle to the Knees with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther piece of Cotton. Their Head-geer is of ſome Silk ſtuff, or moſt commonly of Velvet, whereof they make two points, which advance on either ſide the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: They go always bare-footed, and are almoſt ever followed by an Hog, who is as familiar to them as the Dog is in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Habits of the Men conſiſt in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ells of Cotton, whereof one part falls from the right Shoulder to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg, the two ends croſſing over the left Arms, inſomuch as half of the Body is always uncovered. They go common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bare-footed, except in a long Tract
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108700:84"/>
of way, when they have ſometimes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Shooes made of Goats Skin, and much like the Sandales of our Monks. In Winter they dreſs 'emſelves in Beaſts Skins, as Tygers, Bears, and Leopards. Thoſe of the Province of <hi>Soulang</hi> dreſſed 'emſelves formerly after the Mode of the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> At this day it is after that of <hi>China,</hi> as well as in all the reſt of the Iſland, where all the Inhabitants went naked, before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſet foot there, which is ſtill at this day obſerved by thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the Mountains; except that they cover groſly, what Civility forbids to name.</p>
               <p>The Men paint their Breaſts, Backs, and Arms, with a juyce of Herbs, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worn out: they have Bracelets of Glaſs and Necklaces of the ſame, and they have ſuch ſtreight Sleeves of Iron upon their Arms, that they can hardly move 'em; as for their Legs, they deck 'em with rows of white Shells very neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Tocadeol</hi> take for a Sumptuous Ornament (for they only deck themſelves with it on Holy-days) a long Reed or Cane of a yard and a quarter in length, the one end of which,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108700:85"/>
is faſtened upon the Reins, the other bends over the Head, to which, is tyed a floating knot of red and white ſtuff, of almoſt half a yard long, and ſeven or eight Inches broad. They have more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a Crown of Cocks Feathers, and the Tails of Bares upon their Arms and Legs. Their Beds are as extraordinary as the reſt, two Stags Skins ſerving 'em for Quilts, Sheets and Blankets: theſe Beds ſeem ſo delicate to 'em, that they are loath to leave 'em; and when that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, which they do the lateſt they can, 'tis with no deſign to go to work, for they are neither Shoo-makers, Weavers nor Joyners. In a word, they make Profeſſion of having no need of the moſt neceſſary Trades: or rather, they know 'em all, every one being capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he has occaſion for: their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Dexterity lies in handling the Bow; and whether running, lying, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſitting, they never fail of hitting the Mark they aim at, provided it be viſible. They are alſo excellent Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, but eſpecially they run with an incredible Swiftneſs, and when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, there is not a Horſe that can outgo 'em; they have, while they are running, a piece of Iron of a round Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108700:85"/>
ſix Inches long, and five Inches broad; they ſtrike with thoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Bracelets or Sleeves of Iron we have mentioned, to animate one another, according to the need they have thereof, making more haſte, or making the leſs ſpeed, according to the number of the blows they give. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation is an Art which they do not underſtand; and all they know in point of <hi>Water</hi> is to croſs a River in the hollow of a Trunk of a Tree: but tho they are ignorant of what is the delight of moſt other Nations, yet they live ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happily, fiſhing and hunting furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em abundantly wherewith to live; and if they have an occaſion or deſire of ſomething elſe, their Women have ſo natural an Inclination to Agriculture, that they find means, without the help of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther living Creatures, to diſpoſe the Earth, to produce 'em what they ſow there. They make War after the ſame manner, that Savage and Brutal Nations do, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> without Art and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and what is therein moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, without Quarter too: for, thoſe to whom Hazard gives the advantage, never give Quarter to their Enemies, for fear they ſhould be taken with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108700:86"/>
of returning to the Charge, or they ſhould become more happy the ſecond time than the former. <hi>Thus,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to remove all Fears that may ariſe from that ſide, it is requiſite to take that courſe.</hi>

               <p>Before I had ſeen this Iſland, I had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard ſay, there were Men with long Tails like Beaſts, but I could never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and I thought the thing ſo far from our Nature, that I could hardly give credit to my Eyes, when they took away all doubts by an Adventure ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what odd. The Inhabitants of <hi>Formo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> being accuſtomed to ſee us, we ſaw one another with ſo much confidence, as not to be afraid of any ill accident on either ſide. So that tho Foreiners, we belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our ſelves in ſafety, and went of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten abroad without a Guard, when Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience made us know that we hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves too far. One day ſome of our People walking together, one of our Miniſters being of the Company, went a Stones Caſt from 'em upon ſome Natural Occaſions, the others in the mean while walked ſtill on, very attentive to a ſtory that was told 'em. When it was ended, they remembred the Miniſter did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and waited for him ſome time:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108700:86"/>
after which, being weary of waiting, they went towards the place where they expected he was; they found him, but without life, and the ſad condition he was in, gave ſufficiently to underſtand that he had not languiſhed long. While ſome kept him, others went on ſeveral ſides for to diſcover the Murderers: they went not far without finding a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſeeing himſelf incloſed by ours, foamed, howled, and made 'em comprehend, that he would make him repent who ſhould firſt approach him. His deſperate Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage made at firſt ſome impreſſion, but at length their fears ceaſed, they took that miſerable Wretch, who confeſſed, that he killed the Miniſter, but they could not learn for what reaſon. As it was a heinous crime, and that impunity might have ill conſequences, they condemned him to be burnt. He was tied to a Poſt, where he remained for ſome hours before the Execution. It was then that I ſaw what hitherto I had not been able to believe; his Tail was above a foot long, all covered with red hair, and very like to that of an Ox. When he ſaw that the Spectators were much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee in him what they had not themſelves, he told 'em<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that that defect,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108700:87"/>
if it was one, came from the Climate, ſince all thoſe of the Southern part of this Iſle where he was born, had the like as well as he.</p>

At the end of the Bridge they enter into the Magazine, in the midſt whereof is the Houſe of the chief or principal Officer of the Company. 'Tis a very regular Building, very large and well furniſhed. There is round the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine a number of Houſes, which form Streets of a good handſome largeneſs, where there are convenient places for the Inhabitants of that little City.

There were thoſe of our Ships Crew, who without being much concerned for what might happen, gave their hearts up to joy, and drank ſo largely thereof, that they ſet up the Flag, round which they ſung, danced, and to which they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded likewiſe to ſhew a Comedy, when a Hurricane came, and broke all their Meaſures; it came with ſo much fury, that we had hardly time to get into the Hold, than the Maſts, Sail-yards, Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, all were broke like Glaſs, and caſt very far into the Sea.

Charity is a Vertue which they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, and neither the Poor nor the Sick can hope from them either eaſe or pity.</p>

The Government is Monarchical; above threeſcore petty Princes do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Proſtrate their Coronets afore the Supream Diadem.

One Temple is dedicated to a Lizard, which they make the Author and Patron of Learning without Altar or Image in it. He that readeth of the huge Works of <hi>Taiscoſoma</hi> holding ſometime an Hundred Thouſand Workmen in labour at once, may preſent to his imagination the incredible Buildings which thoſe Tyrants, by ſo many Slaviſh Hands, can raiſe.
