            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>That they have often sinn'd upon their Backs,</l>
               <l>How easily the Priest comes in for snacks,</l>
               <l>And shrievs the pretty Pen'tent <hi>Alamode,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>No trick like a <hi>Jure Divino</hi> Fraud.</l>
               <l>Thus are their chiefest Doctrines plain Device,</l>
               <l>Pimp to their Pride, their Lust and Avarice;</l>
               <l>In Holy Apostolical Disguise</l>
               <l>In short, the whole mysterious Cheat doth lye,</l>
               <l>In Superstition and Idolatry,</l>
               <l>Two Spurious Graffs</l>
               <l>Set in the Tree of Life, Religion,</l>
               <l>By whose luxurious Branches 'tis o'regrown</l>
               <l>To such a monstrous Disproportion;</l>
               <l>That the first Planters would it quite disown,</l>
               <l>Religion like a modest Rural Maid,</l>
               <l>No artificial Dress, no <hi>Fucus</hi> had,</l>
               <l>But was in Native Innocency clad.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:97167:4"/>Till in <hi>Rome</hi>'s Court she ceased to be such,</l>
               <l>Thence sprang her Infamy and first Debauch;</l>
               <l>There laying plain simplicity aside,</l>
               <l>She grew to lazie Wantonness and Pride:</l>
               <l>Yet still some modesty confin'd her home,</l>
               <l>Nor rambled she beyond the Walls of <hi>Rome:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Till proud of her successful Charms, she grew</l>
               <l>Ambitious greatest Monarchs to subdue:</l>
               <l>So by deceitful Arts sh'enlarg'd her Power,</l>
               <l>And made them Slaves that she had serv'd before:</l>
               <l>Then wisely some the Vassalage forsook,</l>
               <l>Others repin'd, as weary of the Yoke;</l>
               <l>She jealous lest her Universal Sway</l>
               <l>Should lessen, and her former Fame decay;</l>
               <l>'Mongst others, did the Schoolmens Pen employ</l>
               <l>To vindicate her Truth and Honesty,</l>
               <l>(Schoolmen who ransack Sciences and Arts,</l>
               <l>To prove with pains that they are Fools of parts)</l>
               <l>So these her Honour justify'd in Words,</l>
               <l>As bully Jesuits plot to do with Swords;</l>
               <l>But both in vain, for 'tis concluded on;</l>
               <l>Their Mistress is the <hi>Whore of Babylon.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Shift, shift the Scene, <hi>Alecto,</hi> Fury, Fiend,</l>
               <l>Wake all thy Snakes and make this Tragick End;</l>
               <l>By Hellish Art raise up in dark Cabal,</l>
               <l>The Pope, a Jesuit, and Cardinal;</l>
               <l>Thy self place in the middle raving wood,</l>
               <l>With Poysons, Pistols, Daggers, Fire and Blood.</l>
               <l>Now let this Scene start into sudden sight,</l>
               <l>By gloomy Flashes of sulphureous Light;</l>
               <l>There let his Holiness's Face appear,</l>
               <l>Full of deep Counsel, weighty thought, and care,</l>
               <l>Whilst each of you in <unclear>awful</unclear> silence hears</l>
               <l>The sacred Oracle with humble Ears.</l>
               <l>Was it for this my ample Power was giv'n,</l>
               <l>For this have I the Keys of Hell and Heaven?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:97167:5"/>In vain I boast of a Supremacy,</l>
               <l>And call my Chair the Universal See:</l>
               <l>A little Nest of Hereticks cut off</l>
               <l>From <hi>Europe</hi>'s Earth, at all my power doth laugh:</l>
               <l>Who though they kindly could decline to be</l>
               <l>A Bar to ballance Gallick Tyranny,</l>
               <l>Yet still oppose my Holy Monarchy.</l>
               <l>False Agents,<note place="margin">Turning to the Iesuit.</note> heartless Traiterous, have you</l>
               <l>So often sworn by Sacramental Vow,</l>
               <l>Or to Convert this Island, or undo?</l>
               <l>Was your Commission scant, did I deny</l>
               <l>Plenipotentiary Villany?</l>
               <l>Have not I null'd Divine and Humane Laws,</l>
               <l>That without Let, you might promote the Cause?</l>
               <l>Heav'ns Laws, though fix'd by an Eternal Seal,</l>
               <l>Stoop and are liable to my Repeal.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> once broke these Tables, often I,</l>
               <l>Not to prevent, but fix Idolatry.</l>
               <l>Thus had your large Commission no restraint,</l>
               <l>Nor did you Apostolick Blessing want;</l>
               <l>Nay more the blackest Crimes in you were Merit,</l>
               <l>For which all others endless Flames inherit:</l>
               <l>So Treasons, Murders, Perjuries, became</l>
               <l>Sure Monuments of your Eternal Fame;</l>
               <l>So Nature's Course was chang'd, yet nothing's done</l>
               <l>T'Advance the Catholick Religion.</l>
               <l>Be gone, Slave, fly, Delude with crafty Words,</l>
               <l>If they prove vain, use Poyson, Fire, and Swords;</l>
               <l>Make better work on't, or I swear by th'Mass,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And</hi> the Divinity of holy Cross—</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>These chance unlucky Words broke all the Spell,</l>
               <l>They vanisht, and <hi>Alecto</hi> sunk to Hell.</l>
