         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſince my application is to you, whoſe

univerſall, the trouble is ſpar'd, and
if there be any thing remarkable by way
of account of him, it is but fit it were
done (<hi>pro more</hi>) in <hi>another</hi> place.
Nor is there, in <hi>this,</hi> any more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
I ſhould (though I might eaſily take
the occaſion) celebrate this kinde of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as the most advantageous of any.
It is in a manner the <hi>Cement</hi> of all

               <hi>ſociety,</hi> the foundation and ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture

all that employ themſelves in <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations</hi>
are ſtrictly tributary, that is, to
ſay, ſomething of their <hi>Authours.</hi> This
indeed is eaſily imagined, but, for my
part, what I have to ſay of mine, ſeems,
<pb facs="tcp:115945:5"/>
at leaſt to me, to be the effect of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
neceſſity, or, if you will have it ſo,
a convenience, that I ſhould give
ſome account of him. For certainly,
when there is ſo much <hi>briguing</hi> and
courtſhip uſed to procure Letters of
<hi>Naturalization</hi> here by perſons that
have lived long among us, for me to
naturalize a perſon, who only took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſee this Country, ſome three
and twenty yeares ſince, and never
thought of travelling into it again ſo
long after his death, without the leaſt
ſatisfaction given, whether he be ſuch
as may be made a free Denizen, and
enjoy the priviledges of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man,
were certainly a preſumption I know
not how to anſwer.</p>
            <p>The perſon I ſollicit for is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in his own Country, <hi>but</hi> one of
the moſt eminent Members of the
<hi>FRENCH ACADEMY,</hi> a <hi>Conſort
<pb facs="tcp:115945:5"/>
of wits</hi> aſſembled together to <hi>harmoniſe</hi>
the language of that Country, and
amidſt their contributory Labours to
all Learning in general, to endeavour
the cultivation thereof ſo farre as to
make it capable of the higheſt Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and ornament. But this haply
is a recommendation not calculated
for the meridian of the ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xpecting to find him more
particularly characterized, I have
thought fit to take him aſunder, and
conſider him in his ſeverall qualities
and perfections.</p>
            <p>He was excellently well furniſhed
with all thoſe qualities which are any
way requiſite or advantageous to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi>
having a certain confident fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
whence all he did or ſaid,
was attended with a more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
grace. His carriage was full of
mildneſſe, affability and complaiſance,
<pb facs="tcp:115945:6"/>
far from all animoſity, deriving neither
reputation nor envie from other mens
works, but judging of things ſoberly,
without prejudice or paſſion. When any
diſcourſe was advanced about any point
of Learning, or that he was to give his
judgement of ſome opinion, he did it
to the infinite ſatisfaction of all the
Audience, with a certain Gallantry
which ſpoke him much free from the
ſupercilious contentiouſnes of the
Schools<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inſomuch that many imagine
his Wit and Genius naturally expreſſed
under the name &amp; perſon of <hi>Callicrates</hi>
in the third Volume of the <hi>Grand Cyrus.</hi>
He was an excellent pattern of a good
and reall Friend, which diſpoſition of
his Heart attended by thoſe others of
his mind gained him ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and that of ſo great ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He never
contracted friendſhip with any he had
once convinced of falſhood, whence it
<pb facs="tcp:115945:6"/>
came to paſſe, that laying the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his affections on vertue and not
on Fortune, they were not ſhaken by
diſgraces.</p>
            <p>Theſe endowments, though they
are not ſo frequent in Courts, yet do
they often bring men thither. They at
leaſt forced our Authour, and gained
him a reputation there, ſuch as that, by
the means of <hi>Monſeigneur d' Avaux,</hi>
(ſometimes his Fellow-Collegian, but
always his Friend and Patron) the doors
of Lords and Princes were open to him.
Nay nature ſeemed to requite the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of bulk ſhe had beſtowed on him
with certain letters of recommendation
writ in a character that purchaſed him
the eſteem and careſſes of the greateſt,
and raiſed him to acquaintances much
beyond what a Courtier of his birth
and quality could have expected.</p>
            <p>This would be thought a fair ſtep
<pb facs="tcp:115945:7"/>
to publiſh charges and employments,
but his Genius directed him to other
things, as having a great diſ-inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for whatever was of Affaires, by
reaſon of the diſtraction and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
incident hereto. Yet, <hi>I</hi> know not
how it happened, he was a kind of
<hi>Master of the Ceremonies</hi> to the Duke of
<hi>Orleans,</hi> his buſineſſe being the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
and entertainment of thoſe
<hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> that came to viſit his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
He was alſo ſent as an <hi>Envoy</hi> to
the Great Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> to acquaint
him with the birth of the preſent <hi>Lewis
XIV.</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> He went twice
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was once here in <hi>London.</hi>
During the Broyls of <hi>France</hi> he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> into <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi>
whence he was by him ſent to
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, where he was very
familiar with the late great Favorite
the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke <hi>d' Olivares</hi> and other
<pb facs="tcp:115945:7"/>
Grandees. He ſtaid ſo long in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,
that he arrived to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue, that he
made thoſe much celebrated verſes,
which were taken to be <hi>Lope de Vega's,</hi>
one of the greateſt wits of that Nation.</p>
            <p>For his <hi>Correſpondences</hi> they muſt
needs be great, that is, conſonant to his
Friendſhips and acquaintances, which
were with the greateſt. The late Prince
of <hi>Conde,</hi> he that is now, and his Brother
the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> had very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
for him; he was alſo much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> the late,
and the preſent <hi>Cardinall,</hi> with whom
he had been a long time acquainted,
and had received divers good offices
from him. His familiarity with the
Cardinall <hi>de la Valette</hi> may be much
ſeen in his letters. Nor is it leſſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

to the houſe of <hi>Rambouillet,</hi> (a place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated

to be the manſion of vertue,
where, in the chamber of the illuſtrious

            <p>But among his more letterd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances,
that is, ſuch as were more
conformable to his humour and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are to be numbred <hi>Monſieur de Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zac,
Monſieur Chapelain, Coſtart,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
all that pretended any thing to
wit, had a reverence and admiration
for his, and have now no leſſe venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for him dead, then they had
eſteem for him alive. Among his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
we find but one to <hi>Monſieur de Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zac,</hi>
which gave us occaſion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
that of <hi>Monſieur de Balzac</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it was an anſwer. But in <hi>de Balzac</hi>'s
letters there are many to Mr. <hi>de Voiture,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115945:8"/>
both in his Volumes, and his choice
letters, not yet publiſhed in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Eſtate conſiſted for the moſt
part in penſions, as may be ſeen partly
in his letters. His great Benefactour
<hi>Monſeigneur d' Avaux</hi> allowed him

That ſtory and much more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, as he was a member of the

               <hi>The Authour of the hiſtory of the</hi>
French Academy, <hi>gives this account of
his way of writing;</hi> His Proſe, <hi>ſaith he,</hi>
is more correct and exact, having a certain
aire of gallantry, which is not found any
where elſe, and ſomething ſo naturall and
elaborate together, that the reading thereof
is infinitely pleaſing. He many times ſlights
<hi>Rules,</hi> and liek a <hi>Maſter</hi> thinks himſelfe
above them, as ſcorning to be fettered by
them, ſo that his writings are not <hi>Copies,</hi>
but <hi>Originals;</hi> having, out of the Ancient
and Modern wits, made a certain new cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
wherein he imitated no man, and
ſcarce any can imitate him. <hi>This I ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:115945:9"/>
have ſomething to ſay to anon, taking
thence at the preſent only occaſion to
give the account I think fit of his</hi> LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS,
<hi>which in this addreſſe was
my particular deſigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent Collection was made
according to the directions of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Chapelain,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Conrart,</hi>
two Members of the <hi>Academy,</hi> who,
out of the eſteem they had for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
memory, took the paines to cull
out of an infinite number, theſe, as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,

               </gap>l circumſtances conſidered, at
that time, to be publiſhed. For the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it is according to the time as near
as could be gueſſed, but it was the
Authours negligence, that he ſeldome
dated his letters, eſpecially as to the
yeare. There are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome few words in
the <hi>Italick</hi> Character, which ſignify
ſomething particular, which, out of
the ſame modeſty, as thoſe who have
<pb facs="tcp:115945:10"/>
put out the ſeverall Editions of this
book in <hi>French,</hi> I have forborn to give
any explication of, not ſo much for
fear of miſtake, as a tenderneſſe for the
Correſpondents. Let therefore the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
make what he can of them, it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that I have acknowledged that
there is in them ſome extraordinary
meaning. The letters of <hi>Love</hi> are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by themſelves, for their ſakes
who ſhall not haply think them ſo full
of wit and vigour as might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In both theſe and the other, there
is abundance of variety, as to expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſomthing particular as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of invention. Only his familiarity,
with ſuch great perſons as he writes
to, may ſeem ſtrange; but it may be
ſuppoſed he knew how far he might
be free, and that that was excuſable in
him, which, in any other haply would
not, yet on ſome occaſions he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb facs="tcp:115945:10"/>
much reſervedneſſe, a great
conduct of judgement.</p>
            <p>But to take the juſt value of this work
we are to appeal, from even the moſt
judicious men, to the women, whoſe
approbation and ſuffrages, we ſhall,
in this caſe, look on as moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Thoſe were they that thought
his writings and diſcourſes their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
entertaiments. Nor indeed is it
leſſe difficult, or leſſe glorious to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
heard in the Cabinet then on
the Theatre. He made it his buſineſſe
to pleaſe the Court, that is, the nobleſt
part of it, the Ladies. Among theſe,
there was (why may I not ſay?) a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
virate</hi> (ſince in their judgements and
their comprehenſion of things of this
nature they were more then Maſculine)
which had an infinite eſteem for him,
and to pleaſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſignifies no leſs then
to pleaſe all the wits of the ſexe. They
<pb facs="tcp:115945:11"/>
are, the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Longueville,</hi> and
the two Marchioneſſes <hi>de Sable,</hi> and <hi>de
Montauſier,</hi> ſuch as a man no ſooner
hears named, but his ſoul is filled with
the image of three the moſt accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
perſons in the world. Such they
are, that Princes, Ambaſſadours, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries
of State preſerve their letters
as ſo many rarities of the <hi>French</hi>
Tongue. So fortunate was this Author
in this particular, that it cauſed two
impreſſions of his works in the firſt ſix
Months, ſince which, they have had
4. or 5. other Editions both in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I come to what <hi>I</hi> intended
to ſay to the foregoing character of his
writings, given by the Authour of the
<hi>Hiſtory. I</hi> produce of him the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his great Friend and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
<hi>Monſieur de Balzac,</hi> in the
<hi>XXIX.</hi> Letter of the ſecond Book of his

&amp; niles choſes, ni les paroles ne
ſont pas tousjours en leur juſte place.</hi> All
the concernment <hi>I</hi> have in this, is, that
if there cannot be a greater affectation
then the <hi>ſlighting and ſcorning of Rules,</hi>
and that it muſt be ever attended with
obſcurity, an imperfection in any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
he who employes himſelfe in
the tranſlation of ſuch things, muſt
expect to meet with much ambiguity.</p>
            <p>But of all writings there are not any
lye more open to various conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then <hi>LETTERS,</hi> it being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
there is ever ſomething particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="tcp:115945:12"/>
between the two correſpondents
which a third perſon cannot poſſibly
imagine. To this therefore may the
defects of the preſent work be juſtly
attributed; and that ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the Authour never intending
any thing of theſe Letters to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and ſeeming to write all he did
only for his Friends, does it in ſuch
characters as were only intelligible by
them.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Poetry</hi> is excellent, but free and
unconſtrained, as having been rather
his diverſion then his Buſineſſe. He
began a kind of <hi>Panegyrick</hi> for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>
Duke <hi>d'Olivares,</hi> to expreſſe his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and acknowledgements of the
favours he had received from him; As
alſo an <hi>Hiſtory</hi> under the name of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidalis,</hi>
mentioned ſeverall times in his
letters; but both are ſo imperfect, that
there is little probability the world will
<pb facs="tcp:115945:12"/>
ever ſee them. Of his Correſpondence
with <hi>Monſieur Coſtart</hi> (for whom it
ſeems he had an infinite eſteem) there
is a great Book extant.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>advantages</hi> may be made
of the preſent work of his <hi>Letters,</hi> I
doubt not but they will be thought
conſiderable by thoſe whom <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi>
generous <hi>acquaintances</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,</hi>
have any way raiſed above the

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THough one half of <hi>France</hi> lye between us, yet are you as
preſent to my Thoughts as the Objects I ſee; and you
are concern'd in all my imaginations. Rivers, Plains
and Cities, may well oppoſe my content, but cannot
take off my memory from the entertainment of, and a
frequent reflection on thoſe excellent Diſcourſes you have honored me
with, till I recover the happineſs of hearing them again. Should you
grow proud of any thing, I muſt confeſs, it ſhould be only of thoſe
ſeeds you have ſcattered in my ſoul; and your company, which at firſt
was extreamly pleaſing, is now become abſolutely neceſſary to me.
You may therefore well think it is much againſt my will that I leave
you ſo long in the Embraces of your Miſtreſs, or ſuffer her to enjoy
what is mine, and not be accountable to me for it. Every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhe allows you of entertainment, are ſo many uſurpations made
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115945:15"/>
upon me; your whiſperings are ſecrets conceal'd from me; and to
enjoy your converſation in my abſence, is for her to inrich her ſelf
to my diſadvantage: But there is no reaſon I ſhould envy ſo fair a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
were it only becauſe you are both equally happy; or build my
affection upon your mutual enjoyments; provided (at my coming)
I find my ſelf after four Moneths abſence fairly character'd in your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and that <hi>Love</hi> hath there aſſign'd ſome place for <hi>Friendſhip,</hi>
and thence hope your condoleances for the miſeries of the times, and
injuſtice of mankind. In the interim, as my joys, where I now am,
are but ſlender, ſo are my afflictions inconſiderable; I am at an equal
diſtance from good and bad Fortune; that fickle Goddeſs, who is
employed in the depopulations, and ſubverſions of States and Cities,
is not at leiſure to do miſchief in mean places. I converſe with <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes,</hi>
who can ſay <hi>I</hi> and <hi>no,</hi> and are too dul to be deceaved by
underſtanding perſons; and though they are equally ſtrangers to
<hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Eloquence;</hi> yet becauſe I am maſter of them, they
would ſuffer me to ſhew how ſmall a diſtance there is between <hi>Power</hi>
and <hi>Tyranny.</hi> Inſtead of the fine words, and quaint diſcourſes
wherein your Ladies abound, there iſſues from their mouths a pure
and innocent breath, which incorporating it ſelf with their Kiſſes,
affords a taſte, which ordinarily the Court does not. If therefore
you prove not happier in your choice there, then I ſhall here, I
make over-particular profeſſion to rely on your judgment, and be</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IF it be true that I have ever had that place in your eſteem, you
tell me, you have not been, in my opinion, as careful of my
ſatisfaction as you ſhould, ſince that in not affording me the
knowledge of ſo great a piece of News; you have continu'd
me in the ignorance of my being the happieſt man in the
world. But, it may be, you conceiv'd that happineſs to be ſo far
beyond any thing I could hope, that you thought your ſelf oblig'd
to take time to bethink you of expreſſions, ſuch as might repreſent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115945:15"/>
it to me as credible; and were to maſter all the forces of your Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
to perſwade me that I ſtill live in your memory: This indeed
I muſt confeſs, very much ſpeaks your juſtice, ſince that, being to
make me no other return of the affection I might claim of you, but
<hi>Words,</hi> you have made choice of thoſe ſo <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Noble,</hi> that, to
be free with you, I am in ſome doubt whether the <hi>Effects</hi> would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
much more; and am abſolutely of belief, that any Friendſhip
beſides my own, might take it for good ſatisfaction. But what I
quarrel at, is, that ſo much Artifice and Eloquence cannot ſhadow
the truth from me, and that I therein am like your Shepherdeſſes, who,
through an over-great ſimplicity, cannot be ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oll'd by too much
wit. You'l however, excuſe me; if I am a little diſtruſtful as to
that Science, which can finde Elogies for <hi>Quartan Agues,</hi> and
<hi>Nero's;</hi> and wherein I know you have ſtronger charms then ever any
man had. All thoſe Gentilleſſes, which I admire in your Letter, I
take to be expreſſions of your greateſt wit rather then of your good
affection; and of ſo many excellent things as you have ſaid in my
commendation, all that I can flatter my ſelf to beleeve, is, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
hath been pleas'd to make me ſome part of your Dreams; and
yet I am to learn whether the reſueries of a ſoul ſo Elevated as yours
is, are not too ſerious, and too rational to deſcend to any reflection
on me; and I ſhall accordingly acknowledg you deal too favourably
with me, if you have afforded me your Love but in a Dream. I
dare not imagine, that amidſt thoſe high deſignations, whoſe preſent
employment is to make diſtributions of glory, and to proportion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to all Vertues, you may have reſerv'd any place for me; no,
I have a greater opinion of your worth, then to be drawn into ſuch
a diſeſteem of it, nor ſhould I wiſh your enemies had ſo much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you with. I am ſatisfied, that that meaſure of affection
which you may with juſtice have for me, is that which you ſhould
have. That precept of <hi>knowing ones ſelf,</hi> which all others ſhould look
on as a memorial of humility ſhould have on you a contrary effect,
that is, oblige you to a contempt of whatever is without you. For
my part, I muſt profeſs to you, that, diſdaining all pretence to <hi>your</hi>
Friendſhip, I ſhould have been content, if you had only preſerv'd, with
ſome little tenderneſs, that which I had vow'd to you, and had diſpos'd
it, if not among thoſe things for which you have any eſteem, yet at

                  </gap> that you have
left me here ſo neer this fair Rival, whom you mention, not to diſguiſe
my thoughts to you, ſignifies that your jealouſie is not very ſtrong,
and you give her ſo much advantage, that I have ſome reaſon to beleeve
you hold a correſpondence with her, to my prejudice. If ſo, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115945:16"/>
I have much greater cauſe of complaint then you, ſince ſhe hath
enriched her ſelf by your loſſes, and that you have ſuffer'd her to gain
that whereof I thought to hav eluded her Tyranny, by diſpoſing it
into your hands. Had you made the leaſt oppoſition in the world
the better part of my ſelf were yet at our diſpoſal; but your negligence
put it into her power, and enabled her ſo to improve her conqueſts
over me, that when I have poſſeſ'd you of all that remains, you ſhall
not finde the one half of what you have loſt. Yet I dare aſſure you,
on the other ſide, that you have recover'd in my <hi>eſteem</hi> the ſame place
that had been taken from you in my <hi>affection,</hi> and that my <hi>love</hi> no
ſooner began to decreaſe towards you; but I thought my ſelf oblig'd
to <hi>honour</hi> you the more. I have not met with any thing of yours
ſince your departure, which ſeems not to me above whatever you had
done before; nay, by theſe late pieces of yours, you have gain'd the
honour of having excell'd him who had out-gone all others. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in the mean time but think it ſtrange, that having ſo much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be content as you have, yet you cannot be ſo, and that all
Great Perſons expreſſing their ſatisfaction of you, there wants only
your own. All <hi>France</hi> is become your Audience, and there is not
any one that hath arriv'd to reading, looks indifferently on you. All
thoſe who any way concern themſelves in the glory of this Nation, are
not more inquiſitive to know what the Marſhal <hi>de Crequi</hi> does, then
what you do; and we have more then two <hi>Generals,</hi> who make not ſo
much noiſe, amidſt an Army of thirty thouſand men, as you do in
your ſolitude. You are not then to wonder that ſo great Reputation
ſhould be attended by much envy, but bear it patiently, if the ſame
Judges, before whom <hi>Scipio</hi> was found a Criminal, and who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
<hi>Ariſtide</hi>'s and <hi>Socrates,</hi> allow you not, by a joint ſentence
all your merits can pretend to. It was ever a Cuſtome with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to hate the ſame excellencies in any man, which they admire in
him, every thing that is out of their Road, being offenſive; whence
they are more ready to bear with a common Vice, then an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Vertue. So that if that Law, which ordered the baniſhment of
ſuch as were over-powerful, either as to <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Reputation,</hi> were
ſtill in force among us; I beleeve the greateſt burthen of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Envy would fall upon your ſhoulders; and that the Cardinal of
<hi>Richelieu</hi> would not run ſo great a hazard as your ſelf. But be it
your care, that you call not that your misfortune, which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that of the Times, and complain not any longer of the injuſtice of
men, ſince that all thoſe who own any worth, are of your ſide, and
that among thoſe you have found a Friend, whom it is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but you may loſe once more. At leaſt give me leave to aſſure
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115945:16"/>
you, I ſhall do all that lies in my power, to put you into a capacity
of doing it; ſince it is now become ſo great a vanity to be numbred
among yours. I have hitherto made ſo publique a profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that if it ſhould happen, I cannot but love you leſs then I was
wont, aſſure your ſelf you will be the only man to whom I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume

               </opener>
               <p>I could never have beleeved it poſſible, that I ſhould give you
any cauſe to complain of me, or that ever Libels ſhould be
written againſt me in <hi>Madrid.</hi> And, to deal ingenuouſly,
I ſhould not eaſily have been appeas'd for the one or the other,
if, when I receav'd that unhappy tidings, I had not at the ſame
time met with an account of your well-fare, and the great Reputation
you dayly gain among a ſort of men, who, before they ſaw you, could
not admire any thing but themſelves. But ſince I number all your
happineſſes amongſt my own, I muſt think it abſolutely unlawful for
me to be ſad at a time when all the world ſpeaks ſo advantagiouſly of
you; nor can I do leſs then rejoice as often as I hear it ſaid here, that
you have taught the <hi>Spaniards</hi> humility, and that they have as much
honour for you, as if you were of the blood of the <hi>Guzman's,</hi> or that
of the <hi>Mendoza's.</hi> You may therefore hence conclude, my Lord,
that my ſoul is more tender then you make it, and that I have this,
at leaſt, common with all the vertuous, that I concern my ſelf in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
good fortune happens to you. 'Tis true, I had once reſolv'd to
ſmother this ſentiment, ſo as not to communicate it even to you.
For amidſt thoſe great affairs whereof you have now your hands full,
I thought it a breach of the publique peace to occaſion the leaſt diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of your thoughts, by any unneceſſary addreſs; and how much
liberty ſoever you might have given me to do it; yet ſhould I not
have had confidence enough to make uſe of it, if I had not another
extraordinary adventure to acquaint you with. Be pleas'd then to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115945:17"/>
know, my Lord, that upon Sunday the twenty firſt inſtant, about
twelve at night; the King and the Queen, his Mother, having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
the whole Court; there was ſeen at one end of the great Hall
in the <hi>Louure,,</hi> where nothing appear'd before, a great brightneſs
brake forth on a ſuddain, and immediately there appear'd, amidſt an
infinite number of Lights; a company of Ladies cover'd all over with
Gold and precious Stones, and ſeem'd as it were newly deſcended from
Heaven: But there was one amongſt the reſt ſo eaſily obſervable, as
if ſhe had been all alone; and I have a certain faith, that humane eyes
never ſaw any thing ſo excellent. She was the very ſame, my Lord,
that upon another occaſion, had been ſo much admir'd under the
name, and in the habit of <hi>Pyramus,</hi> and that had, another time
appear'd among the Rocks of <hi>Rambouilllet,</hi> with the bow and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of <hi>Diana.</hi> But imagine not that you can repreſent to your ſelf
above half her Beauty, if you meaſure it only by what you have ſeen;
and know, that this night, the <hi>Fairies</hi> had ſhed on her thoſe ſecret
advantages of Beauty, which make a difference between <hi>Women</hi> and
<hi>Goddeſſes.</hi> For even when ſhe had mask'd her ſelf with the reſt, in
order to the <hi>Ball,</hi> which they were to repreſent, and conſequently
had loſt the advantage her face gave her over them, the Majeſty of her
ſtature and carriage rendred her as remarkable as before; and whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhe went, ſhe drew along with her, the eyes and hearts of the
whole preſence. In ſo much, that renouncing the errour I was in, in
beleeving ſhe could not dance excellently well; I now confeſs, it was
only ſhe that could. And this very Judgment was ſo generally given
by all preſent, that thoſe who cannot endure to hear her praiſes, muſt
needs baniſh themſelves from the Court. This, my Lord, acquaints
you, that while you receive great honours where you are, you miſs
great enjoyments here, and that Fortune how nobly ſoever ſhe may
employ you elſewhere, does you no ſmall injury, when ever ſhe takes
you from your own houſe. For, in fine, now that you have gone
over the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, if you ſhould paſſe that Sea which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates
<hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> and proceeding further, would viſit that
other ſide of the World, which Nature ſeems to have diſpos'd at a
great diſtance, purpoſely for the greater ſafety of her Wealth and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
you ſhould not find there any thing ſo rare, as what you have
left behind you; and indeed all other parts of the earth, cannot afford
you what may equal that you have left at <hi>Paris.</hi> This puts me into
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>belief, that your abſence will be as ſhort as may be; and that as ſoon
as his Majeſties affairs ſhall give you leave, you will return hither to
enjoy thoſe Goods, which none but your ſelf can be worthy of. But,
my Lord, I am not ſatisfi'd, whether we are not over confident of a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115945:17"/>
Nation, that hath made ſo great uſurpations upon us, to have truſted
you in their power, and accordingly fear the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will be as
loath to part with you as <hi>la Valteline.</hi> This fear certainly would
put me into a far greater diſorder, were I not confident that thoſe of
the Councel of <hi>Spain,</hi> have not ſince your coming into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
been Maſters of their own reſolutions; and that you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
made too many ſervants there, to ſtand in fear of any violence.
We may then hope, that as ſoon as the Sun, which ſcorches men, and
dries up Rivers, ſhall begin to re-aſſume his heat, you will return hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and overtake the Spring, which you had already paſs'd over there,
and gather Violets, after you have ſeen the fall of Roſes. For my part,
I expect this ſeaſon with much impatience; not ſo much becauſe it
furniſhes us with Flowers and fair weather, as that it brings your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and I promiſe you I ſhal not think it pleaſant, if it come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

powerful graces whereby you gain the affections of all that ſee you;

               <p>THis certainly is the nobleſt Adventure, that ever <hi>Orlando</hi> was
engag'd in, nay, when he alone defended the Crown of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi>
and ſnatch'd Scepters out of the hands or Kings, he could
not pretend to any thing ſo glorious, as now that he hath the honour
to kiſs yours. The Title of <hi>Furioſo,</hi> under which he hath wandred
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115945:18"/>
all over the earth, muſt not divert you from granting him that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
nor frighten you from affording him your preſence; for I am
confident he will be civiliz'd by being near you, and that he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<hi>Angelica</hi> aſſoon as he ſhall have ſeen you. This at leaſt I know
by experience, that you have already done greater Miracles then this,
and that you have ſometime, with one word, cur'd a greater madneſs
then his. And certainly, it were far beyond all that <hi>Arioſto</hi> hath
ſaid of it; it he ſhould not acknowledge the advantage you have over
the Lady, and confeſs, if ſhe were plac'd near you, that ſhe would
addreſs her ſelf, with much more neceſſity then ever, to the Vertue
of her Ring. This Beauty, who of all the Knights in the world, met
not with any compleatly arm'd, who never ſmite the eyes of any one,
whoſe heart ſhe wounded not, and who by her love, burnt up as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts of the world, as the Sun enlightens, was but a faint draught
of thoſe Miracles which we are to admire in you. All the Colours,
all the Adulterations of Poetry have not been able to repreſent her ſo
fair as we finde you, it being a thing even beyond the reach even of
Poetical extravagance; for to ſay truth, it is much more eaſie to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
Chambers of <hi>Chrystal,</hi> and Palaces of <hi>Diamonds;</hi> And all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
of <hi>Amadis,</hi> which you look on as ſo incredible, ceaſe to
be ſuch when once compar'd to yours. At the firſt ſight, to fix the
moſt obſtinate minds, and ſettle ſuch as are at the greateſt diſtance
from ſlavery; to kindle in them a certain love, that ſubmits to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
yet knows not what hope or deſire means; to Crown with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Delight thoſe ſouls whom you have depriv'd of all reſt and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and to diſmiſs thoſe infinitely ſatisfied, whom you do not any
ways oblige; theſe are effects more ſtrange, and more remote from
probability then <hi>Hippogryphs</hi> and <hi>flying Chariots,</hi> or whatever our
<hi>Romans</hi> furniſh us with that is yet more wonderful. I ſhould make
a greater Book then that which I ſend you, if I continue this Diſcourſe;
but this Knight, who could never be brought to give any man prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is troubled that I wait on you ſo long, and advances to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
you with the Hiſtory of his Loves. 'Tis a favour you have often
deny'd me; and yet I ſhall, without jealouſie, allow him to be in
that more happy then I, ſince he promiſes me, in lieu thereof, to
preſent you but with this Diſcourſe in my behalf, and to oblige you
to read it before any thing elſe. This enterpriſe is too great for a heart
leſs confident then his, and I know not how fortunate he may be in
it. However, it is in my opinion, very juſt, ſince I afford him
the means to entertain you with his own paſſions, that he give you

               <p>OF ſo many ſeveral imaginations as have been the productions

who excell all others in that part of the ſoul which inſpires <hi>Painters,

that blame which is caſt upon it, which is, that it admits not excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,

that great illumination of mind, which enables you at the firſt ſight

<hi>Madam,</hi> to tell you, that you can judge of them, ſince I durſt
affirm, that, when you are ſo pleas'd, you can exquiſitely do them.
And indeed it hath happened, that even when you have not been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

inexpreſſibly troubled, and yet, all notwithſtanding,
I have not been unmindful of what commands you
had layd on me. As I paſs'd by <hi>Eſpernay,</hi> I went, by your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

Magnificence of his Monument, that conſidering the condition I was
in, and finding my ſelf not able to get thence, I was very deſireous to
be buried near him. But this was a little boggl'd at, becauſe it was
perceiv'd I had yet too much warmth about me: I reſolv'd therefore
to cauſe my Body to be tranſlated to <hi>Nancy,</hi> whither, at length, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
it is come, but ſo out of caſe and fleſh, that I aſſure you, there
are many interr'd, that are not ſo much. Eight days have I ſpent
here, yet not recover'd my ſelf, and the more reſt I take, the wearier
I am. Beſides there is ſo vaſt a difference between the fifteen days
wherein I had the honour to be with you, and the fifteen laſt paſt, that
I wonder how I can ſuffer it; and me thinks, <hi>Monſieur Margone,</hi>
who is a School-Maſter here, and my ſelf, are the two moſt deplorable
examples of the inconſtancy of Fortune, that ever were ſeen. I am
troubled with certain obſtructions and weakneſſes, which ſpare me not
a day, there being no ſuch thing here, as <hi>Theriacon;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I am ſicker then ever I was, and that in a place where I can finde
no Remedies. So that <hi>Madam,</hi> I much fear, <hi>Nancy</hi> may prove as
fatal to me, as it was to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> and that after I have
run through great hazards, and oppos'd great Enemies, as he had
done, it is decreed I ſhall end my days here: But I will hold out as
I can, for, I aſſure you, I never am ſo much in fear of death, as when I
think I ſhall not have the honor to ſee you again. And therefore having
miſs'd death by the hands of one of the moſt excellent Ladies in the

it would trouble me very much to come and lay my bones three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

               <p>ALL the inventions you have furniſh'd me with for my

and the more rational your advices ſeem to me, the leſſe
reaſon I find to take any heart, ſince they are only my
remembrancers, that I can no more hear a perſon, whoſe

the place is pleaſant enough; and there is not one of the quality of

through <hi>La Becauſe;</hi> and I remember I have met better company

               <p>UPon Friday in the afternoon, I was teſſ'd in a blanket,
becauſe I had not made you laugh in the time aſſign'd me to
do it, according to the ſentence of Madam <hi>de Rambouillet,</hi>
upon the motions of the Lady her Daughter, and the Lady
<hi>Paulet.</hi> They had once put off the execution till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of <hi>Madam la Princeſſe</hi> and yours, but they have ſince reſolv'd
not to delay it any longer, out of a conſideration that puniſhments
ought not to be referr'd to a ſeaſon that ſhould be abſolutely conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to joy. It was to little purpoſe for me to cry out, or to reſiſt;
the blanket was brought, and four of the ſtrongeſt could be met with,
were choſen to do the buſineſſe. All that I can tell you, <hi>Mâdam,</hi> is,
that never was any man ſo high as I was, nor could I ever have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
Fortune ſhould ever have exalted me ſo much. Every toſſe
ſent me out of their ſight, even beyond the Soarings of Eagles. The
Mountains I ſaw infinitely below me, and could obſerve the winds
and the clouds travelling under my feet, I diſcover'd countreys which
I had never ſeen before, and Seas which had never come into my
imagination. There cannot be any thing of greater diverſion, then
to ſee ſo many things at a time, and to take a ſurvey of one half of the
earth at one ſight. But I aſſure you, Madam, that all this cannot
be ſeen without diſturbance, when a man is in the air, and is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to fall down again. One thing I was extreamly frightened at,
was, that when I was gotten up very high, and look'd downwards,
the Blanket ſeem'd to me ſo little, that I thought it impoſſible I
ſhould ever fall back into it, and this I muſt confeſſe put me into ſome
diſorder. But among ſo many ſeveral objects, as at the ſame time
entertain'd my eyes, there was one which for ſome minutes put me
out of all fear, and found me a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re then imaginary pleaſure. And
that is, <hi>Madam,</hi> that deſirous to look towards <hi>Piedmont</hi> to ſee what
was done there, I ſaw you at <hi>Lions</hi> juſt as you were croſſing the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</hi>
At laſt, I perceiv'd on the water a great light, encompaſs'd
with an infinity of beams, ſuch as are thoſe of the greateſt Beauty in
the World, I could not well diſcern who was with you, by reaſon
that at that time my head was downwards, ſo that I believe you ſaw
me not your ſelf, for you look'd another way. I made ſignes to you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115945:21"/>
as much as I could, but as you were going to lift up your eyes, I fell
down ſtill, and one of the tops of the Mountain <hi>Tarara</hi> depriv'd
me of your ſight. I was no ſooner got down, but I would needs
give them an account of you, aſſuring them I had ſeen you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
breaking into a laughter, as if I had told a thing abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
they began to make me dance up more nimbly then before.
There happened one ſtrange accident, ſuch as will ſeem, to thoſe
who ſaw it not, incredible; in one toſs which they gave me, as I
came down again, I fell into a cloud, which being very thick, and
I extreamly light, I was for a good while entangled in it, and could
not get out ſo that they below were at a loſs for a long time,
ſtretching the Blanket, and looking up to the skies, not able to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
what was become of me. By good fortune there was not any
wind ſtirring, for if there had, the cloud paſſing along would have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me ſome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>way or other aſide, and conſequently I had fallen to the
ground, which could not have hapened, but I muſt needs hurt my
ſelf very much. But there fell out afterward a much more dangerous
accident, the laſt caſt they gave me into the air, I fell amongſt a
flight of Cranes, who at firſt ſight were amaz'd to ſee me ſo high, but
coming nearer, they took me for a <hi>Pigmey,</hi> with vvhom, as you
know, <hi>Madam,</hi> they have carried on a war from the beginning of
the world, and thought I was ſent as a ſpy to ſee what they did in the
midle Region of the air. They fell upon me pell-mell, pecking at
me as faſt as they could, and that ſo violently, that I thought my
ſelf ſtabb'd in a hundred places vvith Ponyards; and one of them,
having faſtened on my Leg, purſu'd me ſo importunately, that it
let me not alone till I vvas fallen into the blanket. This put my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
into a certain fear of returning me to the mercy of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
for there vvas an infinite number of them got together, that
hung ſtill in the air, expecting I ſhould be ſent among them. They
carried me therefore to my Lodging in the ſame blanket, ſo bruiſ'd
that it vvas impoſſible I could be more. And to deal ingenuouſly,
this exerciſe is ſomevvhat violent for a man of ſo much vveakneſſe as
I am, You may judg, <hi>Madam,</hi> vvhat Tyranny there vvas in this

you to command, it concerns you in time to accuſtom your
ſelf to hate injuſtice, and to take the oppreſſed into your protection.
It is therefore my humble ſuit, Madam, that you vvould declare
this manner of proceeding illegal, and ſuch as you muſt diſapprove;
and for reparation of my Honour and ſtrength, to order that a large
Canopy be ſet up for me in the blevv-Chamber at <hi>Rambouillet-Houſe,</hi>

               <p>I Am novv ſatisfy'd that the ancient Cardinals aſſume a great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
in compariſon of ſuch as are but lately admitted to the
dignity, ſince that though I have written divers times to you,
and not receiv'd any thing from you, you yet quarrell at my ſloth.
But in the mean time I meet with ſo many perſons of good quality,
who tell me, that you honour me too much in the remembrances you
are pleaſ'd to afford me, and that accordingly I am oblig'd to write
to you, and ſend you my moſt humble thanks, that I am reſolv'd
to follow their advice, not minding any concernment of my own
therein.</p>
               <p>Be pleaſ'd then to know, my Lord, that ſix dayes after the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe,
and fifteen dayes after my death, Madam <hi>La Princeſſe,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Burbon,</hi> Madam <hi>du Vigcan,</hi> Madam <hi>Aubry,</hi> Mademoiſelle
<hi>de Rambouillet,</hi> Mademoiſelle <hi>Paulet,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Chaudebonne</hi>
and my ſelf, left <hi>Paris</hi> about ſix of the Clock in the evening, to go
to <hi>La Barre,</hi> where Madam <hi>du Vigean</hi> was to entertain Madam <hi>la
Princeſſe</hi> at a Collation. We met not with any thing by the way
worth the obſervation, ſave that at <hi>Ormeſſan,</hi> we ſaw a Dog,
which came to the boot of the Coach, and fawn'd upon me. You
may be pleaſ'd to take notice my Lord, that, as often as I ſay, we
met, we ſaw, we went, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſpeak in the quality of a <hi>Cardinal.</hi>
From thence we arriv'd at <hi>la Barre,</hi> and came into a Hall ſtrew'd all
over with Roſes and Flowers of Oranges. The Princeſſe much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115945:22"/>
that piece of magnificence, would needs viſit the walks,
in the interim between that and ſupper-time. The Sun was then
ſetting in a cloud of Gold and Azure, and ſcattered no more of
his beams, then would ſuffice to ſhed a pleaſant and gentle light;
the Air had diſmiſs'd all wind and heat, and Heaven and Earth,
in a certain competition to Madam <hi>du Vigean,</hi> would needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the nobleſt Princeſſe in the world. Having paſs'd through
a ſpacious Court, and large Gardens full of Orange-trees, ſhe
came into a wood, into which, Day had not been admitted for
a hundred years, till that hour that it came in along w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th her. At
the end of a ſpacious walk, as far as we could ſee, we found a
Spring, which alone, was guilty of a greater liberality of water,
then all thoſe of <hi>Tivoli.</hi> About it were diſpos'd four and twenty
Violins, which had much ado to drown the noiſe which the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the waters made. Being come near it, we diſcover'd in
a hollow Seat, which was within a Paliſado of fruit-trees, a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
about the age of eleven or twelve years, and more beautiful
then the Forreſts of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly</hi> had ever ſeen her. She
carry'd her Bow and Arrows in her eyes, and had about her all
the Beams of her brother. In another Seat not far from it, there
was one of her Nymphs, handſom and gentile enough to be of her
retinue; thoſe who give not much credit to Fables, thought them
to be Mademoiſelle <hi>de Burbon,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Prianda,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they were very much like them. All the company ſtood in a
profound ſilence, as admiring ſo many objects, which at the
ſame time charm'd both eyes and ears, when on a ſudden the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs,
iſſues out of her Seat, and with a grace, beyond all repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
began a <hi>Bal,</hi> which laſted for ſome time about the
Spring. What is moſt remarkable, my Lord, is, that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt
ſo much pleaſure, which ſhould abſolutely take up and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the minds of thoſe engag'd therein: there wanted not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
of you, and it was the general acknowledgment of all, That
there was ſomething defective to ſo great enjoyments, in that you
and Madam <hi>de Rambouillet</hi> were not there. Whereupon I took
a Harp, and ſung.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Pues quiſo me ſuerte dura,</l>
                  <l>Que falt ando mi Sennor</l>
                  <l>Tambien faltaſſe mi dama,</l>

               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:115945:23"/>
And went through the reſt ſo melodiouſly and ſo mournfully,
that there was not one in the company, who ſhed not abundance
of tears; and this had laſted a long time, had not the Violins
ſuddenly ſtruck up a Saraband ſo full of life, that all riſe up as jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund
as if nothing had been, and ſo leaping, dancing, vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
turning, and tumbling, we came into the houſe, where
we found a Table ſo well furniſh'd, as if it had been ſerv'd in by
<hi>Fairies.</hi> This, my Lord, is ſuch a circumſtance of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as cannot be deſcrib'd, and certainly there are no colours
or Figures in Rhetorick, can repreſent ſix Biſques, which were
the firſt entertainment of our eyes. But this was particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that there being only Goddeſſes at the Table, and two
Demi-Gods, that is to ſay, Monſieur <hi>de Chaudebonne</hi> and my
ſelf, they all fed, and that neither more, nor leſſe heartily,
then if they had been really mortal. And indeed, to ſay truth,
never was there a handſomer ſervice, and among other things,
there were twelve ſorts of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſh, ſo diſguiz'd, no man ever heard
any talk of, and whereof the very name is yet to be learn'd. This
particularity, my Lord, hath unfortunately come to the ears of
the Marſhal of Saint — Lady, who, though ſhe had given
her twenty drams of Opium more then ordinary, yet could never
ſleep ſince. At the beginning of Supper we had not your health
up, as being otherwiſe very merry, and at the end there was no
more done, by reaſon, as I think, it was not thought on. You
muſt not, my Lord, expect that I ſhould flatter you, but that,
as a faithful Hiſtorian, I give you a true account of what paſt;
for I would not have poſterity miſapprehend one thing for another,
and that ſome two thouſand years hence it ſhould be believ'd your
health was drunk to, when there was no ſuch thing. Yet dare I
not but do truth this right, that it was not for want of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
of you, for all Supper-time, there was much diſcourſe
of you, and the Ladies wiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>'d you there, ſome of them very
heartily, or I am much miſtaken. At the riſing from Table
the noiſe of the Violins drew up the company into an upper cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which was ſo well enlightened, that the day, which was
gone from above the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, ſeem'd to be wholly retir'd thither.
Here the <hi>Bal</hi> was reaſſum'd in better order and more handſomely,
then it had been about the Spring, and that which was of greateſt
magnificence in it, was, my Lord, that I danc'd my ſelf. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle
<hi>de Bourbon</hi> was indeed of opinion, and that juſtly, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115945:23"/>
I did not dance well, but that I was a good Fencer, becauſe that
at the end of every cadence, I ſeem'd to put my ſelf into a poſture of
defence. The <hi>Bal</hi> continu'd with much pleaſure; when on a
ſudden, a great noiſe was heard without, which oblig'd all the
Ladies to look out at the windowes; and there iſſu'd out of a great
wood, which was about three hundred paces from the houſe,
ſuch a number of Fire-works, that all the boughs and bodies of
the trees ſeem'd to have been turn'd into crackers, that the Stars
were falling out of Heaven, and that the Sphere of fire were to
take poſſeſſion of the middle region of the Air. Theſe three Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles,
my Lord, well priz'd, and reduc'd to juſt value of things,
are worth three dozen of crackers. When all were recovered out
of the aſtoniſhment, whereinto this accident had put them, it
was reſolv'd we ſhould depart, and we took our way towards <hi>Paris,</hi>
by the light of twenty Torches. Having croſs'd over the quarter
of <hi>Ormeſſon,</hi> and the great Plains of <hi>Eſpinay,</hi> we paſs'd without
any oppoſition through the midſt of St. <hi>Denis</hi>'s. Sitting in the
Coach immediately next to Madam — I repeated to her in
your behalf, a whole <hi>Miſerere,</hi> whereto ſhe anſwer'd with much
courteſie and civility. We ſung by the way, abundance of <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans,
Petits-doigts, Bonſoirs,</hi> and <hi>Bon-Bretons.</hi> By that
time we were got a League beyond St. <hi>Denis</hi>'s, it was two of the
clock in the morning: the trouble of the journey, watching,
and the exerciſe of the <hi>Bal,</hi> had made me extreamly heavy; when
there happens an accident, which I thought would have prov'd my
final deſtruction. There is a little Village between <hi>Paris</hi> and Sr.
<hi>Denis</hi>'s called <hi>La Villette,</hi> at the end whereof we met three
Coaches, in which were gotten the <hi>Violins,</hi> whom we had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
all the day before. Take then, my Lord, the ſtrange
accident that happened; the Devil would needs put it into the
mind of Mademoiſelle — to give order they ſhould follow us,
that we might ſpend the whole night in <hi>Serenades.</hi> This propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
made my hair ſtand upright, and yet it was ſeconded by all
the reſt. The Coaches were ſtai'd, and the order ſent them what
they ſhould do; but, as good fortune would have it, the Raſcals
had left their Inſtruments at <hi>La Barre,</hi> for which Heaven reward
them. Hence, my Lord, you may eaſily judg, that Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle — is
as dangerous a Lady for the night as any in the
world, and that I had much reaſon to ſay at Madam — there
was a neceſſity of ſending away the Muſick, otherwiſe that it was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115945:24"/>
in vain to entertain any thoughts of a departure. We kept on our
way without any diſturbance, till that, entring the Suburbs, we
met ſix luſty Plaiſterers, who being ſtark naked, paſs'd by the
Coach wherein we were. At laſt we got into <hi>Paris,</hi> and what I
am now going to tell you, is more dreadful then all the reſt:
We found the whole City cover'd with a horrid obſcurity, and
whereas we had left it about ſeven hours before full of noiſe, Men,
Horſes, and Coaches, we now meet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have: That which you have ſent, hath cauſed amazement in all
thoſe that have ſeen it; and, what is much more to be admir'd, and
which I think beyond all the power of Magick, it hath rais'd in
the Marchioneſſe of <hi>Rambouillet</hi> a Love, and in me a Joy, the
very day of your departure. I cannot apprehend how that could
happen to you. But the Letter and Preſent which came from
you, made me forget all my misfortunes, and I received the little

that which makes one of the three parts of the world, and which
is divided into divers Kingdomes. And indeed it is of greater

               </opener>
               <p>I have with your Letter receiv'd, the greateſt joy I met with,
ſince your departure hence. If you pleaſe to call to mind with
how much ingenuity and Friendſhip, all the Letters you do me
the honour to direct to me, are written, you will no longer
doubt of it; and you would diſcard the opinion you are in as to
my negligence, if Fortune had not pleas'd, the laſt I writ to you
ſhould miſcarry. 'Tis a miſcarriage you ſhould be the more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of, in regard there was one enclos'd from Mademoiſelle <hi>de
Rambouillet.</hi> She entreats you to ſatisfy your ſelf from Madam
<hi>de St. Amand,</hi> to whom it was directed, what is become of it;
for ſhe is much troubl'd, by reaſon of diverſe things ſhe writ to
you about. But for my part, Madam, aſſure your ſelf I take ſo
much delight in writing to you, that I take not much more in
being idle. And my Letters are the productions of ſo ſincere an
affection, that if you judg aright, you will eſteem them much
beyond thoſe which you are ſo importunate for. Thoſe were only
the iſſue of my invention, theſe of my heart, thoſe I was at ſome
charge at, theſe extreamly divert me. Should I not have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115945:27"/>
you a little, Madam, if I had repeated <hi>theſe</hi> and <hi>thoſe</hi> five or
ſix times more, and would you not have been ſurpriz'd at the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
of the ſtile? I thought to have done it, meerly to ſee what
you would have ſaid, but ſince you are not here, I am in no
great inclination to laugh, and I ſhould have been gone hence
long ſince, if a certain change of my affairs had not detayn'd me.
My ſloth is born under the moſt fortunate conſtellation that may
be, it never wants ſome pretence or other to avoid the doing of
what it hath no mind to do, and I have put off my departure
from one week to another, yet it is no fault of mine, that I am
here ſtill. I believe, Madam, you will not think this ſtrange,
ſince you would have ſtaid here till now, had not the Chariot of
the <hi>Poſt-houſe</hi> forc'd you hence. But I am reſolv'd to ſnatch my
ſelf out of <hi>Paris</hi> within ten or twelve days, and I conceive I ſhall
find no great difficulty in it. At leaſt, the greateſt inducement
I had to ſtay here, was taken away the day of your departure; and
if any thing could at the preſent enforce me thereto, it ſhould be
Madam, and Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rambouillet,</hi> who tell me every
day that I ſhould be gone. <hi>I</hi> can aſſure you, Madam, without
any violence done to the ſincerity <hi>I</hi> owe you, that you are lov'd
by theſe two Ladies, as much as you can deſire, and I hear them
dayly diſcourſe of you with ſo much tenderneſs, that one of thoſe
things I ſo much at this preſent eſteem in them, is the affection they
bear you. Be therefore as much aſſur'd of them, as of me, and place
not their Friendſhip among thoſe Goods which you may loſe. I
am extreamly glad that you have ſatisfy'd ſome others who are not
of this nature, and that you have taken that order in your affairs
that you deſired. I return you my moſt humble thanks, that among
your own you have had a careful reflection on mine. The indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
I am guilty of as to that particular, beſpeaks a neceſſity of
knowing what I ſhould do, ſo as I durſt not diſobey, and that I
ſhould entertain the advice of a perſon, whoſe counſels are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
That about which I was ſo much troubl'd, and was the
cauſe of my ſtay, is in a better condition then I could have hop'd,
and I doubt not but we ſhall take ſome order in it, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of a certain ſum of money. But I ſhall think my ſelf well
out of the Bryars, if I eſcape ſo: Beſides Madam, I ſhall hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
be the leſſe troubled for wealth, now that I am aſſur'd you
will not want any. If it come to the worſt, the Secrets I know
in <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> may prevail with you to afford me a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115945:27"/>
retreat, and to cloath me like a Gentleman, when you ſhall think
fit I ſhould uſher you. You were very much in the right, when
you thought I ſhould want your recommendation to Mademoiſelle
<hi>d'Atichi,</hi> and I humbly entreat you, Madam, to write to her
in my behalf. I have ſeen her but once ſince your departure.
That with what Monſieur <hi>Nerti</hi> ſhall be able to acquaint her
with, will, I hope, ſatisfy her, that you recommend unto her
a perſon you look not indifferently on, and one, whom you
have found ſo faithful, as to have deſerv'd that good office from
you. If ſhe believe it, I conceive, Madam, that ſhe will think
better of it, then of many other things; for there is nothing more
certain (pardon me, Madam, if I ſpeak it not with reſpect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)
then, that I love you beyond any thing this world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords,
and with all ſincerity, am,</p>

               <p>THe beginning of your Letter gives me occaſion to admire your
Judgment, for I muſt acknowledg you have been more appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of a reſentment, which lay dormant in my heart,
then I was my ſelf. Me thought I was extream earneſt to depart:
but what pleaſure ſoever it may be to me to hear from you, yet I
muſt confeſſe that when I ſaw <hi>Robin,</hi> I was ſomewhat at a loſſe to
think I had no pretence for any longer ſtay, and I think I ſhould
have been content to wait ſeven or eight days for that joy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Madam, I cannot have been ſo far ſurpriz'd, but I ſhould
eaſily recover my ſelf, through the care you are pleas'd to have of
me, and I am extreamly ſatisfy'd, to ſee that you have written
more Letters for me in one night, then you have done in four
years for Madam <hi>Deſloges</hi> and Madam <hi>D'aubigni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is queſtionleſſe, the greateſt expreſſion or affection may be
expected from you, eſpecially if I conſider the circumſtances
wherein you write to me, and I muſt no longer doubt, that you
will direct all things to the advancement of my Fortune, ſince you
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115945:28"/>
contribute thereto your own pains, I acknowledg it, Madam,
with ſuch a heart as you know I have, and beſides the great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
it affords me, as to my own particular, I think it a far
greater, to find you as generous and as noble a friend as I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wiſh'd you. And I am to profeſſe to you, I am ſo far at reſt,
as to that part of my Fortune, that I am afraid I ſhall neglect it
in others things, and ſhall ſlight the friendſhips of Queenes, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I ſhall think my ſelf aſſur'd of yours. Be not therefore, I ſhall
entreat you, Madam, the leaſt troubl'd at what you have done
for me, or what may be the iſſue of it, nor what effect your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
may have; but if you have written any, either for my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
or reputation, aſſure your ſelf they have prov'd as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
as you could have wiſh'd. I ſhall not fail to obſerve the order
you have given me for the delivery of them. For the reſt you
have done very well to excuſe the ſtile, for, not to diſſemble with
you, that jargon of <hi>Marfiſa, Merlin,</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> is to me
inſupportable. And yet I cannot amidſt all this, but obſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of wit, and a ſtrange vivacitty, but above all, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
inclination to do me ſome favour. I am extreamly
pleas'd at what you tell Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rambouillet,</hi> that if they
be not more careful, I ſhall go into <hi>Flanders,</hi> as if I went to
<hi>Vaugirard;</hi> and in my judgment, that very word is worth a
good Letter. 'Tis very true Madam, that had they not been ſo
careful as to give me notice of it, I had gone with the Meſſenger
of <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> And to deal truly with you, I go this journey with
ſo much regret, that I cannot imagine I ſhould fear to be taken;
and were it not for Madam — I ſhould be content to paſſe the
reſt of the Winter in a chamber in the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> ſo that it may be
allow'd good fires. The — is abſolutely ruin'd; Monſieur
 — hath for theſe four months paſt, profeſs'd a ſtrict friendſhip
with him, and Monſieur <hi>de Bellegarde:</hi> you may eaſily judg,
Madam, he will never be the better for it, no more then I. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle
<hi>d'Atichi</hi> hath promiſed me wonders, and that with ſo
much affection, as you could have done your ſelf. I acknowledg
I have not deſerv'd ſo much at her hands, and know not whether
I ever ſhall; aſſure your ſelf of Madam <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> and be not
troubled for any thing elſe, I have receiv'd all your inſtructions,
and ſhall obſerve them. Madam and Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rambou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illet</hi>
have an infinite affection for you. I bid you farewell Madam,
with the tears in my eyes, and aſſure you, I love you proportionably
to your merits, and much beyond your imaginations.</p>

               <p>TO deal freely with you, It is an impardonable ingratitude in
you not to have taken the pains to ſend me ſome Anſwer, and
to be more ſlothful then I am, ſpeaks a ſloath abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable.
What fair pretences ſoever I made a ſhift to finde for
my not writing to you for ſix Moneths together; yet have I not
diſmiſs'd <hi>Robin,</hi> without ſomething to aſſure you, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

pleaſe. I could ſometimes heartily wiſh, that I might, with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle

by good fortune had not been entertain'd any where; ſhe
hopes you will receive her as a perſon ſhe hath choſen for you, and
accordingly hath diſmiſs'd her two days ſince. I ſhould not have
written ſo confidently if I had not been commanded; for, beleeve

               <p>IF you concern not your ſelf in my content nor my quiet, yet at
leaſt be not ſo negligent of my fortune. I am upon the point
of my departure, which yet I muſt put off till I hear from you.
I fear me, that the Letters you have ſent me bear too old a date; if
you have not broke off all correſpondence in that Country; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it were much to my advantage that you gave me others, or
took ſome occaſion to ſpeak in my behalf, if you think fit. But
if otherwiſe, it will be but neceſſary that you ſpeak for your ſelf,
and that by your Letters you renew the aſſurance of your fidelity
and ſervice. And that, Madam, will prove a continual kind of
recommendation for me. I humbly beſeech you to ſend to me
with all poſſible diligence, for there is not any thing elſe ſtays my
departure. I bid you Adieu, Madam, with ſo great affection,
and ſo much tenderneſs, that it were much more dangerous that
<hi>Nerli</hi> ſhould ſee this then the other, and aſſure your ſelf I am much
more troubled to live at a diſtance from you, then to quit the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
I leave here. Thus, Madam, are you more conſiderable with me
then all the world beſides, and if you knew after what manner it is,
you would be ſatisfy'd with it, though nothing but whole hearts wil
content you. I tell you this with as much ſincerity, as if they

you tell me, that thoſe who honou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> me with their affection, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
at my ſloth, when they themſelves are ſo far guilty of it, that
they employ others to reproach me with it. The condition I am
in conſider'd, it were much more rational to ſend me Conſolato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
then complaints, and it ſeldome happens that the perſecuted,
the baniſhed, and ſuch as are ſequeſtred, finde others ſport. When
I ſay ſo, I ſhall entreat you not to think that I mean any thing
againſt that excellent Perſon, whoſe exceſs of merit, and want of
health, exempt her from all obligations of this nature. But thoſe
whoſe buſineſs is to complement, and only to exerciſe their wits,
are not, in my judgment, to be pardoned, the neglect of doing me
that honour. I aſſure you there never was any ſadneſs compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to mine, and if I durſt write pittyful Letters, I could tell you
things would make your heart burſt: But to ſay truth, I ſhall be
glad it ſhould remain whole, and ſhould much fear that, if it were
once in two, it would be ſhar'd away in my abſence. You ſee
how well I can apply thoſe ingenuous things I hear ſpoken; but
Madam, it concerns you, (from whom I have this, ſince I forget
not any handſome expreſſion of yours not in two years after I
have heard it) to ſend me ſome, ſince I can ſo well make my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
thereof, and ſend me ſome words which I may think my
ſelf oblig'd to remember as long as I have thoſe: All I have ever
ſeen from your departure till now, is ſo indifferent that it hath not
taken away any thing of my affliction; and therefore I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to ſend me ſome thing of greater vertue, ſince you can
furniſh others with as much as you pleaſe. Otherwiſe I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the precipitate reconciliation which was made ſo ſuddainly
before my departure, was feigned, and that there was not any thing
of ſincerity in you, but what ſignifies your coldneſs, and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115945:30"/>
I leave it to you to judge whether it is poſſible I can

Since that, I have known no diſturbance though I have had
much pain; for I would not have it ſaid, That a man, for whom
you are pleas'd to have any providence, can be unhapy, and ſhould
be aſham'd Fortune had a greater influence over me then you. I
have Travell'd twelve days without any reſting from morning till

               <p>I am very far from having any thing to object againſt your Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
ſince it is accompany'd with ſo much Goodneſs, and
that it is not leſs employ'd for the advantage of others then your
own. <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs <hi>I</hi> ſhould have been very much troubled to
be the firſt unfortunate man that you ſhould have given over for
ſuch, and that you ſhould have exercis'd on me the apprentiſhip
of that diſ-compaſſionate Vertue which never yet could claim any
acquaintance with your Generoſity. And whereas thoſe actions
which are not perform'd without danger are of greater eſteem then
others, it cannot be expected there ſhould be always ſecurity for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well, and you are, Madam, in my opinion, particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to be tender of the unfortunate, ſince that to change their
condition you need apply nothing but words. Thoſe <hi>I</hi> have had
the honour to receive from you, have wrought on me the effect
you could imagine, in ſo much that I have not ſince known any
affliction ſave that of being unable to expreſs the reſentment <hi>I</hi> have
of them. There is nothing ſo certain, Madam, as that when you
are pleas'd not to be croſs, you are the moſt accompliſh'd perſon in
the world; and Goodneſs, which is ſo delightful wherever it is
found, is much more adorable in you, where it is better attended
then ever it was in any one. You had long ere this met with my
moſt humble thanks for what you are pleas'd to have for me if <hi>I</hi>
had had the feaſt favourable opportunity to ſend them you: and I put
this Letter into the hands of Fortune as a forlorn, though <hi>I</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not how it ſhall paſſe through ſo many difficulties and fires,
wherewith we are encompaſs'd. And yet <hi>I</hi> believe it will not be ſo
unhappy as to miſs you, meerly becauſe it is directed to you, and
that you muſt needs receive it through the aſſiſtance of that good
fortune, which you ſay you have in things of ſmall conſequence:
<hi>I</hi> ſhould here take occaſion to acquaint you with divers that are of
great, and which <hi>I</hi> could wiſh within your knowledg; but <hi>I</hi>
conceive it is your deſire <hi>I</hi> ſhould be diſcreet as well as your ſelf, and
that <hi>I</hi> ſhould not write any thing, that mightlye open to cenſure.

In the mean time, though we are of contrary parties, I ſuppoſe
I may affirm, without any crime, there is not any one of ours
whom I would ſo readily follow as I ſhould you, and that I ſhall

               <p>IT concernes me much more then you, that the accomodations
you had ſent me, ſhould not fall into other hands then my own.
Of all the Goods I have left me, there are none I am more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to part with, then thoſe I have receiv'd from you, and
I ſhall eaſily digeſt the want of all the others, if <hi>I</hi> may but enjoy
thoſe. If the <hi>Stones</hi> you have beſtow'd on me, are not able to
break <hi>mine,</hi> they will at leaſt help me to bear my pain with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
patience; and me thinks <hi>I</hi> ſhould never complain of my cholick,
ſince it hath procur'd me ſo great a fortune. And yet <hi>I</hi> muſt
needs tell you, that this generoſity was like to coſt you dear, and
it was not improbable, that theſe <hi>Stones</hi> might prove ſo many
<hi>rubs</hi> in your way. He at whoſe houſe <hi>I</hi> ſojourn, knows you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
me with your Letters, ever ſince I ſhew'd him that wherein
you remembred your ſelt to him. He was in place, when your
Letters came to my hands, and he either knowing or gueſſing by
the ſuperſcription, it was your hand, I acknowledg'd it was ſo.
My firſt curioſity was to look into a paper, which ſeem'd much
heavier then the reſt, and having opened it, I disburthen'd it of
a Bracelet, the moſt glittering and gallant that ever was. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expreſſe the greatneſſe of my ſurpriſal, to find a thing ſo little
expected from you, and to ſee how indiſcr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et I had been in the
firſt favour I had receiv'd from you. I out-bluſh'd the <hi>Riband</hi>
you had ſent me, and he who was preſent, put on a Countenance
ſo ſevere, as if it had been ſent me by Mademoiſelle — But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
read your Letter, I found that, what ſeem'd to be a favour,
prov'd a <hi>Remedy,</hi> and that the Bracelet was not ſent to a <hi>Gallant,</hi>
but to a ſick perſon. You may ſay your pleaſure, Madam, but me
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115945:32"/>
thinks I am of a very good nature, for though I ſhould have given
all <hi>I</hi> have in the world, that you would have done a piece of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
of this nature to me, yet was <hi>I</hi> much pleas'd on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that it was not any, and was very glad to be my ſelf, leſſe
happy, that ſo you might ſeem leſſe cenſurable. So that for this
time, <hi>L'Ejade</hi> hath had for you an effect which you expected not
from it, and its Vertue juſtifyes yours, which was accus'd, and
in my opinion, ready to receive a ſevere Sentence. This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
I cannot but eſteem it very precious, and coming from
ſo good a hand, I have a great faith in it. <hi>I</hi> ſtood in much need
of ſuch a remedy, in a Country where there is no other to be had,
and where relief is rather to be expected from <hi>ſtones</hi> then <hi>men.</hi>
And if you call to mind a certain particularity, which was told us
heretofore concerning this place, you would have a greater pity
for thoſe that have the <hi>Colick.</hi> Though you ſhould not find out
what I mean, I ſhall not be much mov'd, for in a man that
ſhould think himſelf felicified, but with a moment of your favour
this diſcourſe is not over-gallant. I ſhall only tell you, Madam,
that you are more then ordinarily oblig'd to be careful of me; For
beſides your having been ſubject to the ſame infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mity, <hi>I</hi> am to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you that at this time, mine proceeds from the ſame cauſe,
and the Phyſitians of <hi>Madrid</hi> give me the ſame advice, as we receiv'd
formerly from Monſieur <hi>de la Grange,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Lorine.</hi>
When you were at the height of your melancholy, you never were
more ſolitary, more intractable, nor indeed more inhumane,
then I am here. You can hardly imagine how different my preſent
life is, from what I have formerly led, and you will one day be
aſtoniſh'd, when <hi>I</hi> ſhall tell you, that I have paſſ'd over eight
months without ſpeaking to any woman, without quarrelling,
without conteſtation, without playing, and what is more ſtrange,
without putting on a pair of ſhoes. This is a very lamentable
thing to relate. I have endur'd a Winter more piercing then that
of <hi>France,</hi> in a place, where there are no ſuch things as Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gowns
or Chimneys, where there's never any fire made, unleſſe
it be for a Victory, or the birth of a Prince. Amidſt this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
I have often wiſh'd the fire at <hi>Rambouillet-Houſe,</hi> here,
and regretted the time, that I refuſed to be the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> of a
much more amiable perſon, then ſhe that governs their maſter.
There's a great deal of Learning requiſite to underſtand this. But
if you gueſſe at the perſon I mean, I humbly crave your pardon,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115945:33"/>
Madam, to aſſure her hence, that I honour her with a greater
paſſion then ever, and that <hi>I</hi> ſhould not quarrell at my abſence,
if <hi>I</hi> thought it had wrought in her the ſame effect it hath done in
me; for, to deal ſincerely with you, it hath reinforc'd the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which I ever have devoted to her Service, and having
paſt an Act of oblivion for all the injuries ſhe hath done me, I
can now only remember thoſe excellent endowments, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
her both ſo amiable and admirable. However <hi>I</hi> might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
it in my countenance, yet had I ſtill a ſecret grudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her, nor could I ever, till my laſt ſickneſſe, be induc'd to
forgive her, the affront ſhe once did me in your preſence, when
ſhe thought to have murther'd me with a Baſon of water. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut
now, <hi>I</hi> have chang'd all deſires of vengeance, into wiſhes to ſee
her, to honour and to ſerve her; and if there be any one in the
world, that I love beyond her, it is only one, whom ſhe alſo
loves beyond her ſelf. For that other, I ſhall ever, in my mind
and in my eſteem, reſerve for her a particular place, ſhe ſhall
never have in my affection, either company or competitor, no
more then ſhe hath in the world: and if the love I bear you, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
only from friendſhip, I muſt confeſſe, I ſhould have a
greater affection for her then for you. Frown not at ihis, nor
think it ſtrange, that I avoid not in my Letters, thoſe things
you may take offence at, ſince you have not that tenderneſſe for
me in yours. For what neceſſity was there you ſhould tell me that,
<hi>thoſe two perſons had made ſuch new acquaintances, as might
oblige them to forget their old friends?</hi> And to what end muſt
this come at the cloſe of the moſt obliging Letter in the world?
If my diſeaſe could be cur'd like the quartane Ague, by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
apprehenſion, this croſſeneſſe might ſerve for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
aud yet <hi>I</hi> ſhould be little oblig'd to you, when curing
me of the Colick, you will needs force me into jealouſie. Be
pleas'd therefore to endeavour my quiet as to that particular; for,
to be free with you, I am thereby ſo much diſcompos'd, that e
have taken very little reſt ſince. I was already in ſome inclination
to that fear; not that I any ways queſtion the goodneſſe of thoſe
Ladies, but I often think what great danger there is in a great
diſtance. In a word, Madam, it is of you that I dare aſſure my
ſelf, for, to ſtruggle with ſo long on abſence, there is not only
a conſtancy requiſite, but an obſtinacy. But ſince you have
done me the favour to number me among your Friends, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115945:33"/>
my unhappineſſe will not give you occaſion to retract it,
and that you will not ſuffer Fortune to bring that about, which
ſo many religious men, and other good people have attempted
without effect. If there be any other who afford me the honour
of their affection, it's a happineſſe I enjoy not without ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt,
as being a good which I may looſe, and from which, time
haply takes away ſomewhat every day. You tell me, your <hi>Miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe</hi>'s
<hi>Miſtreſſe hath not forgotten me.</hi> This I queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I can decipher. Your Miſtris, is it not a young Gentlewoman,
very much Eagle-ſighted, having ſomewhat a ſhort noſe, one that
is ſubtle, fierce, ſcornful, ſelf-conceited, and obliging, one
that is of a good and bad nature, much given to chiding, and
yet is ever pleaſant, a very vertuous Gentlewoman, who hath a
mother that uſeth her very harſhly, and whom I lov'd one time
from <hi>Bagnolet</hi> to <hi>Charronne?</hi> If it be the ſame, her Miſtris,
without queſtion, deſerves to be Miſtris of all the world, and
I have maintain'd for eight months together in this Court, that
there is not beneath Heaven any thing ſo good and ſo glorious as
ſhe. I have not ſo great a reſentment of all my own afflictions
put together, as I have of hers, and I have ſhed abundance of
tears, wherein ſhe hath been the moſt concern'd. It is certainly a
thing very ſtrange, and pleads much compaſſion, that there
ſhould be ſo much happineſſe in her birth, and ſo little in her life,
and that the ſame perſon own at the ſame time all the graces, and
all the diſgraces in the world. I receive the honour ſhe does me,
with all the reſpect and all the joy I ought, and my prayers to God
are, that he would comfort her, as ſhe doth others. This good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhould cauſe no ſmall ſhame to the Lady, on whom were
once found a brace and a half of lice. But me thinks your Miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
is too retentive to let me know any thing, and yet ſhe might
without any danger of jealouſie, have afforded me a complement.
You make it much your buſineſs to aſſure me of the friendſhip of
<hi>your Servant,</hi> but if it be not the ſame I mean, I ſhould not
take it well, you beſtow'd ſo much of your thoughts on him:
but that perſon deſerves all things, and I know not any thing I
ſhould envy him. For Madam <hi>de Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rmont,</hi> though you had
ſaid nothing to me, yet ſhould I be ſatisfy'd ſhe does me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to love me; having the experience I have of her charity,
I cannot doubt of her affection, and there needs no more to come
into the number of her friends, then to be liſted among the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115945:34"/>
Amid'ſt the joy, the honour I have done me by ſo many
excellent perſons, brings with it, it is an extraordinary grief to
me that you tell me nothing of a man from whoſe remembrance
you know, I derive no ſmall comfort. I am ſatisfy'd <hi>Madam,</hi>
that it is not your fault; that is, that you have not any thing to
acquaint me with concerning him. There's not any circumſtance
of all my misfortune troubles me ſo much as that, nor for which
I can have leſs patience. I fear me, he takes it not well that I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
him; but neither this conſideration nor any other ſhall make
me ungrateful, nor hinder me from declaring wherever I am, that
there is not any man can deſerve the affections of his Friends, and
the eſteem of his enemies, more then he. If the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>
be at Court, be pleas'd to give me leave, humbly to entreat him
to ſpend ſome few thoughts on me, and to give an inſtance of his
conſtancy, by loving a perſon at ſo great a diſtance, and withal ſo
unſerviceable. I was the other day very much pleas'd to find Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſele
<hi>de Montauſier</hi> in the News-Book; but me thinks it
were much more reaſonable that the young Gentleman had been
there, and by what acquaintance I have with him, I ſhould not
think the fame of his Siſter ſhould ſpread further then his: I wiſh he
knew how much I am ſtill his humble ſervant, and wiſh him all the
happineſs and noble adventures he merits. But I muſt except a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Lady, in whoſe Embraces I once wiſh'd him; and I now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
her, that ſhe will be guilty of the greateſt ingratitude in the
world, if any thing cauſe her to forget me: For, without flatery,
the paſſion I have for her, is beyond any thing ſhe can imagine.
Which yet if after all, ſhe reward with a treachery, I ſhall one day
not ſtick to make uſe of Steel or Poiſon to revenge my ſelf: You
can hardly gueſſe, <hi>Madam,</hi> who it is I mean; and it is a ſecret too
important to be truſted to any one. I only deſire you to ſhew this

me. You may well think it unreaſonable, ſay what you will, that
I ſhould moderate the praiſes I am to give you, and that <hi>I</hi> ſhould
begin to ſpeakleſs well of you when <hi>I</hi> receive moſt good from you.
<hi>I</hi> could not anſwer the former, becauſe <hi>I</hi> was ſick when the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
departed, and to ſhew that the joys of miſerable people are but
ſhort liv'd, the next day after <hi>I</hi> had received it, <hi>I</hi> was taken with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115945:35"/>
the Colick, which <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> had loſt, and one days eaſe coſt me
ſeventeen days torment. Madam <hi>de Clermont</hi> honours me beyond
all poſſible deſert of mine; and <hi>I</hi> am throughly ſenſible of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
obligation ſhe hath caſt upon me. And yet <hi>I</hi> ſhall
not beleeve ſhe loves me to that height ſhe ſpeaks, nor that I am ſo
much concern'd in her Prayers, if <hi>I</hi> continue in this decay both
of health and fortune. And yet it is a greater then <hi>I</hi> can ever hope
that the Lady, whom you know I ever place above all the reſt,
will be pleas'd to look after my concernments. There's no Oracle
I ſhould more willingly rely upon then her Providence; and
I receive her counſels and her commands, as if they came from
Heaven. Though I cannot find a place high enough for her in my
own mind, yet I dare aſſure her, that I have ever thought her
preſent at whatever hath befallen me. She hath often comforted
me in my greateſt afflictions, and that part of my Soul, wherein
ſhe was, hath been free from all troubles and diſturbances, into
which my miſeries had hurryed me. I adore her as the nobleſt,
the moſt beautiful, and moſt perfect thing that ever I ſaw: And
yet all the reſpect, all the Veneration I have for her, cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me from having a moſt tender affection for her as the beſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the world. I muſt alſo confeſſe, the Lady her Daughter
owns no leſſe goodneſſe, if it be true, as you tell me, Madam,
that ſhe is pleas'd to think of me. I ſhould gladly ſome way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
this honour, but me thinks one heart will not ſuffice
both and her mother, and that when one hath taken her ſhare,
there will be little left for the other. The favour done me by three
perſons ſo accompliſh'd, frees me from all troubles, yet gives me
withall a new one, which is, that I can never deſerve it, nor
expreſſe, as I would, the reſentment I have of it. And ſince it
requires infinite thanks, I humbly beſeech you, Madam, to
employ yours together with that Eloquence, which is ſo natural
to you, for to thank them; and let me not want your aſſiſtance
in this, which you afford me in all things. When I reflect on the
honour you and they do me in your remembrances; I wonder,
that, being ſo happy in that, I am ſo unhappy in other things,
and that ſo much misfortune can befall a man that hath ſo many
Guargian Angels. I am not yet ſatisfied, whether be greater the
happineſs of being belov'd, or the unhappineſs of being abſent; and
I finde that of all men I am the moſt to be envy'd, and the moſt to
be pittyed. I have the greater reaſon to ſay this, that I am not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115945:36"/>
miſtaken in your Letter; and if it be true the Lady, whoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
you ſo earneſtly maintain, though not impeach'd, hath
done me the honour to write to me, I ſhall eeſily ſwallow down all
the checks you gave me upon that account. Nevertheleſs, I ſhall
entreat you not to think I raiſe a particular quarrel againſt her; but
not having receiv'd any recommendations, ſave from two or three
perſons; the complaint was general againſt all the reſt, from whom
I had not receiv'd a word ſince my coming hither. 'Tis true, I
think her much more to blame then any other, that ſhe who hath
the greateſt memory in the world, ſhould be ſo ſcanty of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her friends; and ſince her thoughts have often paſs'd the
<hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains for <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> and to imagine in <hi>Spain</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that never were there; I could not but wonder ſhe ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
thoſe that are, and are at her ſervice. And if ſhe hath done me
the honour you tell me, ſhe hath gone much beyond my hope, and
done for me more then I durſt have deſir'd. But it being paſt, it
is a loſs I know not how to brook. I know, <hi>Madam,</hi> that, though
I had ſaid nothing to you, you will eaſily imagine with what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
I ſuffer it: But me thinks, you, who take the pains to ſend
me the Letters of Monſieur <hi>de Balzac:</hi> and Coppies of all the beſt
things, ſhould not have forgotten that. I have perus'd
with much ſatisfaction, what was ſent him upon the death of the
King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and am glad to ſee the greateſt Wits pay him the
homage and acknowledgment due to his mem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry. The Sonnet I
am much taken with, and the Letter is excellently well Pen'd.
I have particularly obſerv'd this in it, that the Author of it, muſt
needs be well acquainted with the humour of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he perſon to whom
he writ; ſince that having loſt a Lover, he ſays not one word to
him by way of conſolation. By good fortune for us, ſhe is more
tender for her friends, and ſince ſhe remembers the moſt inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
and indeed who can never deſerve that name, ther's no
doubt of the reſt: For my part, whatever I may have ſometimes
heard from that man, who you ſay is ſo ſevere, and for whom I
durſt ſay nothing here; I have thought it impoſſible that a perſon
that begets a friendſhip in all that ſee her, ſhould have none in her
ſelf; and that having deriv'd ſo many excellent qualities from the
Lady her Mother, ſhe hath miſt the moſt Noble, which is, that
of being the beſt Friend in the world. You ſee <hi>Madam,</hi> how I can
correct thoſe faults you reprove in me. I bileeve I have reform'd
them by what I have ſaid, and anſwered thoſe reproaches you caſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115945:36"/>
on me for commending you to her prejudice. I have choſen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to retract my thoughts of her, then what I had ſaid of you,
and I have thought it eaſier to add to her praiſes, then to abridge
yours. I have receiv'd you <hi>Judith</hi> with extraordinary ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I ſay, with extraordinary ſatisfaction, becauſe it deſerves
it, beſides what I do therein for your ſake. For I think you are
extreamly taken with this Hiſtory, and are well pleaſed to ſee an
action of blood and murther juſtifi'd by the Scripture; I could not
in the reading of it, ſtave off an imagination, that I ſaw you holding
a Sword in one hand, and the Head of Monſieur de St. <hi>B</hi>— in
the other: You tell me it is done by the Author of the Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles; you conſider not <hi>Madam,</hi> that a Perſon
who hath waded through ſo much ſickneſs and affliction, muſt
needs have forgotten abundance of things, eſpecially ſince what is
left is taken up in things wherein it is ſo well employed. You put
me to a like non-plus in another Letter, telling me, your ſervant
deſired to be remembred to me; what likelyhood is there to gueſſe
aright who it ſhould be? My firſt imagination was it might be a
<hi>Cardinal;</hi> the next, a Doctor of Divinity: Afterwards I thought
it might be a Merchant of <hi>Aubry-Boucher-Street,</hi> or a Knight of
<hi>Malta;</hi> a Privy-Councellor, a Poet, or a Judge; and there is
not any Rank, wherein I found not ſome cauſe to doubt: But if
it happen to be a young Gentleman, flaxen hair'd, of a very fair
complexion, and a perſon infinitely ingenuous, nothing could
happen more to my ſatisfaction, then the leaſt expreſſion of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances
of me; and it ſhall be the main buſineſs of my life, by
my moſt humble ſervices, to deſerve his affection. As poor as I
am, I would it had coſt me a thouſand Crowns, that I could have
play'd a Game at Tennis with him, which had not been impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
had I been ſuffered to take my own courſe; for I was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to return by <hi>Paris,</hi> and you might have ſeen me within a
while of the Religion of Monſieur <hi>d' Aumont;</hi> but I ſubmit and
obey, though with no ſmall trouble. I am not certain when I
ſhall leave this place, whether within a Moneth, two, or three.
I have told one man here how much he is oblig'd to you for your
remembrances of him: He returns you his moſt humble thanks,
and hath engag'd me to tell you he is infinitely your Servant. We
keep houſe together, and live in the greateſt Friendſhip poſſible:
I crave pardon of the Lady you know; and I leave her to judge,
who is ſo skilfull in things to come, what <hi>I</hi> may promiſe my ſelf
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115945:37"/>
thence, and whether <hi>I</hi> may not one day arrive at a good ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
as well as he. Behold, <hi>Madam,</hi> another large Letter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
you know but the leaſt part, and whereof <hi>I</hi> have ſaid nothing of
what moſt nearly concerns me. Behold what it is, not to anſwer the
Gallantries which you write, and to ſend me Letters, wherein you
ſpeak only of your Friends, and ſay in a manner nothing of your
ſelf. Nevertheleſs <hi>I</hi> have not made it ſo much my buſineſs to be
reveng'd, as that I can avoid profeſſing in this place, that <hi>I</hi> repeat
for you alone, all the expreſſions of eſteem and affection, which <hi>I</hi>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>ABout ten or twelve dayes ſince, <hi>I</hi> writ to you, and thank'd
you for two Letters, which I have at length received from you.
If you could apprehend what ſatisfaction they brought along
with them, it would be your grief you had ſent me no more; and
that you had not afforded me this comfort, in a time that <hi>I</hi> ſtood
in ſo much need of it. <hi>Madrid,</hi> which is the pleaſanteſt place in
the world for the healthy and the debauched, is the moſt weariſome
to the temperate and the diſeaſed; and when Lent comes in, and
makes a Vacation among the Players, <hi>I</hi> know not of any one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
which a man may conſcientiouſly make uſe of. The ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and ſolitude <hi>I</hi> ſtruggle with here, have wrought on me at leaſt
this one good effect, that they have reconcil'd me to Books, which
<hi>I</hi> for a while ſhaken hands with; and meeting here with no other
entertainments, <hi>I</hi> have been forc'd to admit thoſe of Reading.
Expect therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> to finde me almoſt as great a Philoſopher
as your ſelf; and imagine what great advantages he may arrive at,
who for ſeven Moneths together, hath conſtantly ſtudied or been
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115945:37"/>
ſick. And if it be granted that one of the principal ends of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
is the contempt of Life, I know no better Maſter for it then
the <hi>Colick,</hi> then which <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> are much leſs perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive:
It hath read me lately a Lecture which laſted ſeventeen dayes,
which I ſhall not in a ſhort time forget, and hath made me many
times conſider how weak we are, ſince there needs but three grains
of ſand to caſt us to the ground. If it oblige me to be of any Sect,
I ſhall not be of that which maintains that pain is no evil; and
that the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> is always <hi>happy.</hi> But Sir, happen what will to
me, I can neither be the one nor the other, if I am not near you;
and nothing can aſſiſt me ſo much to attain both, as your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and your preſence. I am yet to know when I ſhall depart hence,
and, expecting men and money to come to me by Sea, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
I ſhall ſtay longer then I deſire, for theſe are two things that
come not alwaies at the time appointed. My humble ſuit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is, That you would not forget me ſo long as you have done,
nor to expreſs, by honouring me with your Letters, that you are

diſcontinue it, though I come ſhort in the acknowledgment
thereof. The condition I was in two Moneths ſince forc'd me to
ſuffer the ordinary Meſſenger to depart without a Letter, and if
that be only the reaſon, as in all likelyhood it muſt, that he is
return'd again without any from you; I aſſure you it is the greateſt
diſcourteſie my Colick ever did me. Since then your Letters are
ſo neceſſary, I beſeech you <hi>Madam,</hi> let me not want that aſſiſtance,
and you, who are ſo charitable towards thoſe who are in any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115945:38"/>
expreſs your ſelf ſuch towards one that wreſtles with ſo many

that I am at ſuch a diſtance from you. And if this regret be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd

whom you love as your ſelf. I humbly deſire you to acquaint
them, and that often, that the paſſion <hi>I</hi> have for them is too
great to be expreſs'd, and let me ever have ſome place in their
inclinations, where you your ſelf have ſo much, that we may
there, ſince we cannot any where elſe, be together. For your
own part, Madam, I beſeech you once more not to forſake me,
the honour of receiving Letters from you, is a happineſſe, which
though I could not have hop'd, yet I cannot be without, now
that I am ſo much accuſtom'd to it. Deprive me not therefore
of it, after you have ſo generouſly afforded it me, and do not
herein oppoſe two vertues which are ſo natural to you, your libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
and your conſtancy, and though it is beyond my power
to ſatisfie this obligation, yet ſhall not I be awanting as to wiſhes,

               <p>THere cannot be any thing more acceptable in your Letters,
then the Letters themſelves; I have met with in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of yours, what you would not have had me to hope till
I came to the cloſure, and you have granted me the ſatisfaction
which you promis'd me elſewhere. It is very p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>obable you did not
read what was added to your Letter by another hand, and that
you, who ſend me gold and precious ſtones, or words of greater
value, would not entertain me with reproaches. And yet I muſt
confeſſe that I do in ſome ſort deſerve what hath been written to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115945:38"/>
me, and that I am not very much a Gallant, ſince I have not
the confidence to be ſuch towards you. It is a great ſhame to me
that I have written ſuch large Letters to you, which yet contain'd
nothing of that ſtile, whereof a Female Friend of yours ſayes,
that it ſeems to her to be all poetry; and that being ſo many
leagues diſtant from you, never durſt acquaint you with any
thing of my thoughts. But I will not be diſgrac'd any longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your account, and if you cauſe not ſome ſatisfaction to be
made me for this affront, I am reſolv'd to treat you with Letters
wholly made up of Love, full of fires, darts, and pierced hearts,
and ſhall break forth into ſo many gallantries, that it ſhall repent
ſome, they have offended me. I am at this preſent extreamly
troubl'd to keep my hands in, and I find no other inducement to
refrain, then to think on that excellent perſon, of whom I have
learnt to prevent in all things what may be to be fear'd, and whoſe
very memory obliges me to reſpect and prudence. I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, Madam, who are acquainted with all the tranſactions
of my mind, to let her know in what poſture ſhe is there, and
with what reſentment and ſincere affection I return the honour ſhe
does me. You may alſo if you pleaſe, ſince you own ſo great a
goodneſs, engage in the ſame manner, Madam <hi>de Clermont</hi> to
continue her affection to me, and her prayers to God for me. I
ſhall for my part, as much as lyes in me endeavour to deſerve
the favours I ſhall obtain through her interceſſion, and it were
certainly very hard, that a man, whom you preach to, and ſhe
prayes for, ſhould not be converted. But you may let her know,
that I beg not ſo much her prayers as her affection, and though I
believe ſhe can make me conſtant holy and happy; I care not ſo
much for all this, as to be lov'd by her: <hi>I</hi> have read, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible
apprehenſion of joy, what you tell me concerning that
divine perſon, before whom <hi>I</hi> once made my Epitaph. <hi>I</hi> dare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
her, that when <hi>I</hi> had two
and was in the power of my greateſt Perſecutreſſes, I was not
more to be pittied then I am now, and that I ſhould wiſh rather
to die in her preſence, then live far from her. After the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
honour ſhe does me, there were not any thing I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
additional to my glory, ſave that I were ſo happy, that the
Lady, who ſhould have been carried away once at <hi>Lima,</hi> had but
remembred me. But it is the pleaſure of Heaven, that the Lady
her mother ſhould remain yet in the world unparalell'd, and if
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115945:39"/>
haply there may be any thing as fair as ſhe, there cannot be ought
ſo good. Me thinks, ſhe, for whoſe ſake I once made the <hi>Dryads</hi>
laugh, Madam <hi>de C</hi>— (I think there were no danger to
put her name at length) ſhould not be ſo much incenſed againſt
the Rebels, but that ſhe might do me the honour to think on me
ſometimes. If the report be true, that we had a deſign to carry
her away, it ſhould have been after the ſame manner the Greeks
took the image of <hi>Pallas</hi> out of the power of their enemies, in
confidence that Fortune and Victory would alwayes attend the ſide
where ſhe were. But for my part, I had no hand in it; ſhe knows,
that my pretences, if ever I had any to her, have been in a fair
way, and ſhe may remember that my addreſſes have ever been full
of reſpect and eſteem. Seriouſly, I cannot be ſo paſſionate for
our affairs, but I muſt be alſo very much for her. When ever I
reflect on her, I ſilence my wiſhes, and I have much ado to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
well affected to my own party. I have been more generous
in commending her, then ſhe hath been in her remembrances of
me. It's not eight daies ſince, that I found means here, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
her ſo like her ſelf, that I ſcru'd up a man, who hath no
reaſon to wiſh well to all her Friends, if not into a Love, at
leaſt into an extraordinary eſteem of her. I am your <hi>Servant's</hi>
moſt humble Servant, and I dare aſſure him, he hath not a
greater paſſion for you then I have for him. You tell me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that one of your houſe hath a greater eſteem for me then for
any man, and that I ſhould look on it as an extraordinary obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:
but it were alſo but fitting you deſcrib'd him more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.
I wiſh it him I mean; if ſo, I deſie all misfortunes.
You may eaſily gueſſe for whom I make this wiſh. I know not
whether it may be any thing dangerous to mention me to him,
but I beſeech you, Madam, let not that frighten you. What
countenance ſoever he may put on it, he is not ſo much to be
feared, he is better then he is taken to be, at leaſt I know thus
much of him, that it is impoſſible he ſhould not love thoſe that
love him. I have divers times thought to have ſent him half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Spaniſh — the neateſt and moſt glittering can be had. Be
not frightned, Madam, I mean <hi>Blades;</hi> and if as I paſſe through
<hi>Granada,</hi> I meet with a pretty Sarazine Laſſe, I ſhall not fail
to ſend her to him: I believe I ſhall take that way when I go hence,
and to follow the directions, or rather the commands I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
I muſt go two hundred Leagues out of my way by Land,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115945:39"/>
and be forc'd to meaſure five hundred by Sea. I quarrell not ſo
much at the hazard and inconveniences of it, as it troubles me
that I cannot paſſe through <hi>France.</hi> Though I have long ſince
been engag'd to promiſe, I ſhall be much troubled to perform it,
and it never coſt me ſo much to effectuate any reſolution as this.
Had I been left at liberty, I ſhould have taken the Road, with
as much freedom, and ſafety as ever, and ſhould have gone from
hence directly to <hi>Bourg-la-Reyne.</hi> I ſhould have had at leaſt
the ſatisfaction of paſſing one night in <hi>Paris,</hi> and I had reſolv'd
to have beſtow'd on you by the way, <hi>Ravergarde,</hi> and <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſette,</hi>
and <hi>aſſure your (If you ſhould have had it home.</hi> I think
that while they diſwade me from that deſign, and ſeem to have a
fear for me, they alſo ſtand in fear of me, and imagine they
might learn ſo much at the office of Addreſſe, and that I fool-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

<hi>Serenades</hi> on three or four perſons, with a little Roaring, and
away; but I muſt obey, and believe that what is impoſed on me
is the better. This ſubmiſſion therefore ought to be acknowledg'd,
ſince in my opinion, it ſpeaks both Obedience and Sacrifice. At
leaſt I hope never to be reproach'd with obſtinacy, ſince I have
been ſo complyant in this. That, and the itch of writing ſo much,
that I know not how to end my Letters, are two notable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

me in your Letter. <hi>I</hi> have a long time conſider'd who this little
man ſhould be, of whom I hear ſuch great things, and who is
eſteem'd ſo much above and below me. It cannot be Monſieur
<hi>de Vigean,</hi> for <hi>I</hi> am but two fingers breadth taller then he, and
he is but ten times more gallant then <hi>I.</hi> After a long reflection,
me thinks it ſmells very much of his ſtory, and that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
there ſhould be in the world a man ſo little or ſo gallant.
<hi>I</hi> humbly beg, Madam, a true account of this buſineſſe.</p>

                  <salute>MADAM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IF your other Letter was of the ſame mettal as that I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
I have not been ſo unhappy in the loſſe of it; and it had
been to be wiſh'd this ſecond time that I had only known, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeeing any thing, that you had done me the honour to write to
me. Having read what you ſent me, as that you had been much
troubl'd to ſend your complements as Forlornes, I expected to
meet with ſome of them, and this paſt, I find none ſave that
you take occaſion to tell me, I am but a little man, and aſſure
me that I am guilty of very little gallantry. If you had no other
to make me, you needed not, Madam, to have put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the protection of the moſt valiant Lady in <hi>France;</hi> and though
they had been found, you would not thence have been thought
well affected to the Rebels, and as to the manner your Letter was
written in, you ſhould fear nothing ſo much as that it ſhould be
delivered me. After ſo much earneſtneſſe as I had for a Letter
from you, that I can aſſure you I made it my only buſineſſe,
you take the pains to write five or ſix lines, wherein you chide
Fortune very much for offering to lay her hands on any thing that
came from yours. And for what concerns me, <hi>There is a man
there now, not ſo tall as you by a Cubit, and il'e take my oath a
thouſand times more gallant.</hi> This indeed is an excellent conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
Letter, after ſo long expectation, and words finely ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
together, to make me forget ſo many ſorts of afflictions. If
I am not miſtaken, I have often told you, Madam, that you
are fitter to write a challenge then a Letter. Having done as you
have, there needs no more then to adde, that you will juſtifie,
in the Court of <hi>Trebizonda,</hi> what you have written, and ſign
it <hi>ALASTRAXAREA.</hi> Is it poſſible, that being
miſtreſſe of ſo many excellent endowments, and having ſo great
power over me, you ſhould make uſe of neither, but to hurt
me, and be like thoſe <hi>Fairies,</hi> who are never well but when
they do miſchief, and diſturbe the good which the others do.
When Mademoiſelle <hi>Paulet,</hi> had written me a handſom oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115945:40"/>
Letter, when my Lady Marchioneſs aſſures me of the honour
of her Friendſhip, when Madam <hi>de Clermont</hi> promiſes me her
prayers, nay when the moſt excellent and moſt accompliſh'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the world honours me with her remembrances, you come
laſt of all, to trouble the general joy, and ſpoil all that they had
done for me. 'Tis ſtrange the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, the Limits
of two great Kingdomes, cannot defend me from you. You
are it ſeems, ſo far from being moved by my misfortunes, that
you perſecute me to the worlds end, and torment me much more
then my own ill-fortune. At a time, when my choiceſt Friends
durſt not hold any correſpondence with me, and when it was
dangerous even to write to me, you trample on all conſiderations,
to tell me, you find me not very gallant, and that there is a
Dwarf whom you are a thouſand times more taken with then me.
My opinion is, <hi>Madam,</hi> that I have juſt cauſe to chide, and
raiſe all theſe complaints. But that you may not be confirm'd in
what you ſay of me, and to ſhew you that I am not ſo ſmall a
gallant, as not to entertain mildly what comes from ſo good,
hands, I ſhall tell you, <hi>Madam,</hi> that,</p>
               <p>I thought my misfortunes had been abſolutely irrelieveable,
and <hi>I</hi> had no ſooner read over what you did me the honour to
write, but they are extreamly moderated. Not that <hi>I</hi> was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in their greatneſſe, but it is becauſe nothing is impoſſible
to you, and that you can apply remedies to things uncapable of
any. The miracle is, that, though you ſpeak nothing but ill
of me, you ſhould be able to do me ſo much good, and that, not
regarding what you write to me, <hi>I</hi> have been ſatisfy'd with
the bare ſight of your hand: Thoſe that profeſſe Magick produce
not ſuch admirable effects, whence it is manifeſt, that you can,
as well as the other, instill into words a ſecret vertue, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

who hath the world under her feet, is her ſelf under yours, and
that you can pardon thoſe, whom ſhe condemns to be unhappy.
Beſides, if <hi>I</hi> am but under your good influence, <hi>I</hi> matter not
the malevolence of the Stars, and though they all conſpir'd my
ruine, yet if you protect me, <hi>I</hi> ſhall think the better part of
Heaven benevolent to me. Forſake not, Madam, <hi>I</hi> beſeech
you, a perſon that repoſes ſo much confidence in you. There
needs no more, to make me happy, but your will <hi>I</hi> ſhould;
and if you can afford but good and hearty wiſhes, <hi>I</hi> ſhall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
feel the effects thereof. You are oblig'd to direct ſome of
them hither to me, for I aſſure you all mine are for you, and the
moſt paſſionate I own, are, that you want not any thing your
Beauty and your Vertue merit. It is true <hi>I</hi> am alſo concern'd in
that; and if ſo, there were no differences of parties, nor no
diſtinction in the world, all men ſhould have but one will, and
the whole earth would obey you.</p>
               <p>This, Madam, is to give you notice, to be more cautious
of what you ſay another time, and that I am not ſo ſmall a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
as you conceive. But if you will needs oblige me to believe
you, command your <hi>Little man</hi> to write a Letter a thouſand
times more gallant then this. But though he had that advantage
over me, I ſhould have another which I eſteem no leſſe, which

               </opener>
               <p>THough I may not be allow'd any ſatisfaction when I want
your ſight, yet it is ſome excuſe, that I have not any but
what I receive from you. 'Tis to you that I owe all the joyes I
have here, and though I have lately been to ſee the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi>
and <hi>Aranw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:115945:41"/>
and that of the <hi>Canes,</hi> I ſhould not have ſeen any thing I could
eſteem in <hi>Spain,</hi> had I not receiv'd your Letters there. Your
trouble takes off a great part of mine, and I forget my unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
when I think that you allow me a place in your memory.
This obligation is ſo exceſſive, that I doubt much whether any
beſides my ſelf could ſatisfie it. But if you pleaſe to conſider,
you will find I have long ſince paid all by the way of advance,
and from the firſt moment I had the honour of your acquaintance,
there hath not paſs'd a day, wherein I have not deſerv'd what
ever good you ſhould ever be able to do me. I am confident,
Madam, you will not attribute this to any vanity, but to an
extraordinary apprehenſion of that paſſion wherewith I honour
you, and to a certain faith I am of, that a perfect affection is
to be preferr'd before all things. That which I have to ſerve you,
is at ſuch a high point, that no other then your own can recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
it; and though you ſhould give me my life a hundred times,
and with it all the goods of this world, you were ſtill very much
in my debt, if I wanted your affection. And certainly herein
you ſhew your ſelf very juſt, in that, ſince you cannot make
me full ſatisfaction, you ſtrive to give me content otherwiſe,
and cover an injuſtice with abundance of Civility. But a grain
of good-will cannot outweigh'd by all the fair words, if any could,
they were certainly your own, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r ſhould you need to make uſe
of others. I wonder much, that when I receive from you a
large pacquet, I find but one ſmall Letter, and what comes
through your hand makes but the leaſt part of what comes from
you. And as I very ſeldom had the honour to viſit you at home,
but there have been five or ſix perſons in your chamber, ſo alſo
you take occaſion to engage as many into your Letters, and
not to write to me but in publick. Imagine not however it ſhall
oblige me to be the leſſe free with you; I will make thoſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
whom you ſeem to appoint for my Judges, and I ſhould
chooſe rather to diſcover my Secret to them, then conceal it from
you. But to be more earneſt, Madam, for I know you wiſh I
had not ſpoke all that you have read, inſtead of complaining of
it, I return you thouſands of thankes for the extraordinary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
I receive from ſo many excellent perſons through your
means, and which I ſhould never deſerve without you. I muſt
needs acknowledg that my wiſhes cannot aim at a greater ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
then to ſee your Letters, but I am very glad that you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115945:42"/>
therein exceed them, and ſhew me more favour then I durſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
If I miſtake not, I diſcovered in your laſt certain lines
drawn by the beſt hand in the world, and I have entertain'd
them with ſo much veneration, as is requiſite to compoſe the
leaves, whereon a Sybil wrote her Oracles. I have a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
for theſe four Verſes, then for all the works of <hi>Malherbe,</hi>
and I, who have in my time ſeen ſome upon the ſubject of Love,
and were done to praiſe me, aſſure you, I never met with any
thing of Poetry, that I was ſo much taken with. I know not of
what kind the affection is, which I have for that perſon, but I
never hear or ſee any thing from him, which ſearches not into my
very Soul, and I cannot apprehend how it comes to paſſe, that
eſteem and reſpect work in me the ſame effects as an over-violent
paſſion. Though you ſay nothing of Madam <hi>de Clermont,</hi> yet
am I confident ſhe cannot have forgotten me, and I humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you, Madam, to do me the favour to tell her, that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more worthy of her affection, I endeavour to grow better
and better every day. The Lectures you read to me, and the
Books you ſend me, contribute not a little thereto. I thank you
for the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> but why, in the condition I am in, do you
ſend me ſuch heavy things? What better Paraphraſe can be had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Miſerere,</hi> then my ſelf? I have at laſt gotten St. <hi>Paul's</hi>
Epiſtles. The two Books, whereof you ſent me one in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
the other ſix weeks after, I receiv'd the ſame day; and for
ought I can judg, the perſon, whom you repreſented to me as ſo
little, is one of the greateſt men in <hi>France.</hi> The Preface, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other things, I extreamly like, and have been mightily
ſatisfy'd with the reading of it. I ſhould ſay more, but that at
the preſent I can admire nothing but Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rambouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</hi>
This I cannot but acknowledg, Madam, whether it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
through ſtupidity or preſumption: I had ſeen, without
jealouſie, all the gallant things, which till now you have
thought your ſelf concern'd that I ſhould, but when I had read
over the anſwer of the <hi>Infanta</hi> Fortune to Maſter <hi>Lac,</hi> I was
much troubled who ſhould be the Author, and, to be free with
you, was extreamly vex'd it ſhould be any other then my ſelf.
I reflected a long time on the moſt deſerving perſons to find out
the Author, yet was not able to pitch on any one; but when I
underſtood by your Letter who it was, for I keep it ſtill for the
laſt, I muſt confeſſe, it was the greateſt joy I had had of a long
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115945:42"/>
time. I was extreamly ſatisfy'd to find the glory due to a perſon
whom I honour'd ſo much before, and to whom I reſign'd ſo
great a part of my Soul, that it is a queſtion whether the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of ſo gallant a Letter may be attributed rather to his then to
mine. But indeed, ſhe ſeems rather to be actuated by that of all
the world, if it be conſider'd how apt ſhe is for all things, and
be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ides, that no other hath ſo much as ſhe, there is not any
hath ſo many different luſtres, or the advantages of all lights as
much as hers. It may be he may take it ill; but I muſt needs
tell you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I thought to have continu'd in the ſame incrredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
I was in once before, for another miracle of her underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and I could not think it poſſible, ſhe could be ſo fortunate
in things of that nature, having never read any Books of that
kind. But ſhe is not to be diſcover'd by Reaſon, but by Faith,
and as ſhe compoſes Hiſtories, wherein all the paſſions are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the life, though ſhe never was ſubject to any; makes a
deſcription of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> though had never ſeen the map<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of them, and is acquainted with all the earth, having never
been further then <hi>Chartres:</hi> In like manner, without ſight of the
ancient <hi>Romanes,</hi> ſhe ſpeaks the Language of <hi>Lancelot du Lac,</hi>
better then the Queen <hi>Geni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ura</hi> could have done, and I believe
ſhe could ſpeak Arabick, would ſhe but undertake it. It muſt
be acknowledg'd ſhe is a perſon very hard to be comprehended,
and that if Madam <hi>de Rambouillet</hi> be the greateſt perfection in the
world, the Lady her Daughter is the more admirable. Be
pleas'd, Madam, to underſtand the praiſes I give with their due
reſtriction, knowing you as I do. It hath hapen'd moreover
very fortunately for me that I have not met with this expreſſion
of her underſtanding, but at a time when I had another of her
Civility: for it would have troubled me very much not to love a
perſon, whom I was oblig'd to eſteem ſo highly. The five or
ſix lines ſhe hath honour'd me with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have received with all the
reſpect, affection, and joy ſhe can imagine, ſo that they have
taken away the reſentment I had of the other Letter. This is one
advantage that perſons that are miſcheivous have over thoſe that
are not, that all the good offices they do, are much better taken,
and the rarity ſeems to ſet a value on the action. And though I
know ſhe hath not done me this favour, but to make me the more
ſenſible of an ill-turn another time, yet can I not avoid being
drawn in by it, and loving her, at this preſent, as if ſhe were
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115945:43"/>
the beſt natur'd perſon in the world. As for the reproaches which
ſhe hath in ſtore to caſt in my diſh one day, 'tis a menace takes
away nothing of the ambition I have to ſee her, and I ſhall ſo far
juſtifie my ſelf, that ſhe ſhall acknowledg I have merited even in
thoſe things, wherein ſhe thinks I have fail'd. Amongſt a many
things which have given me extraordinary ſatisfaction in your
Letter, I am particularly pleas'd at one thing you tell me, that,
as you were writing, a deſerving perſon was troubl'd that he was
forced to retire at one of the clock in the morning, without ſeeing
me. It is long ſince I have paſſionately wiſht ſome aſſurance of
the honour he does me in his remembrances. I ſhall not ſtick to
tell you, there is not any man in the world, for whom I have a
greater reſpect; but I dare not acknowledg how much I love him,
leaſt the intereſt of your <hi>Husband</hi> oblige you to take it ill, and
reproach me with an ill diſpoſal of my affections. You, who
hold it as a general rule, that all perſons of that quality cannot
love, ought to admit of ſome exceptions as to him; and as I
have heard you often affirm, that he had more generoſity then
others, you may alſo conclude, he hath alſo more Friendſhip.
But grant it were not ſo, and that he had abſolutely forgot me,
yet is it certain, I could not poſſibly abate any thing of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I have for him. I can no more oppoſe this inclination then
that I have for you, and you ſhould not think it ſtrange I ſhould
love an ungrateful man, when you know I have ſo long lov'd
a woman, that is ſuch. Nay, to be free with you, even at
that time that I thought he had quite forgotten me, I have not
paſſed a fair evening in the <hi>Prade,</hi> but I have wiſhed him there.

if I had been here; I would carry him to ſing before gates which
ſhould open more eaſily then yours, and where we ſhould be

place certain Creatures, which thoſe of the Country call <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
which as to their ſhape are very handſom, having a very
ſmoth skin, being mild, active, and gameſome, very eaſily
tam'd, and naturally compliant to mankind. The coolneſſe of
the night, which they are much taken with, cauſes that about
that time, they are ordinarily found in the ſteeets, and if I miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake
not his curioſity for things of this nature, I am confident he
would be extreamly glad to ſee ſome of them. I humbly beſeech
you, Madam, ſince I am endebted to you for all things, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115945:43"/>
all the intereſt you have in him, to oblige him to honour
me with his remembrances; and if you can engage him to love
me, I will bear with you ſix months longer, for what you owe
me. I know not whether your <hi>Servant</hi> hath done me the honour
to write any thing to me, I am ever his moſt-humbly, with as
much paſſion as ever, and it's not three days ſince I lock'd my
ſelf into a chamber, and in memory of him ſung <hi>Pere Chambaut,</hi>
half an hour together: There are at the bottom of your Letter
three ſeveral hands, which I know not whoſe they are, and if I
miſtake not, never knew. I had once reſolv'd to have got them
anſwer'd by three of my Friends, Spaniards; but I have not had
the time, being on the eve of my departure. I hope to be gone
hence within three or four days, in order to the progreſſe I writ

that, if I chance to dy in it, Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rambouillet</hi> will

               </opener>
               <p>THere is nothing awanting to your fortunes, ſave that you have
never been guilty of High-Treaſon, and now ſee I furniſh
you with a fair occaſion for it. Fortune, who hath not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
any to bring you on the Stage, will not haply fail to make
uſe of this, I eaſily perceive that I put you into ſome danger by
writing to you, and yet that very conſideration cannot oblige me
to forbear. Hence you may alſo inferre, that I would ſet any
thing at ſtake to put you in mind of me, ſince I bring your ſelf
into danger, on whom I ſet a higher value then on all this world
affords. This I tell you, Madam, in a time, when I would
not diſſemble, no, not in a Complement. For, (that you
may know how the caſe ſtands) I have made an extraordinary
advantage of the ſickneſs which you have been told I have had. It
hath engag'd me to take ſuch good reſolutions, that if I had them
not, I ſhould gladly purchaſe them with all the health I have. I do not
doubt but you will laugh at this, as knowing my weakneſs, and
will think it unlikely for me to execute ſimple reſolutions, who
have broken ſo many vowes. And yet it is certain, that I have
look'd on all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> women as if they were no other then the
Flemiſh of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and I hope to prove a vertuous man, inſtead
of a man of this world, where there are ſo great temptations, and
where Satan ſhelters himſelf under the handſomeſt ſhapes. In all
this reformation I am troubled but with one ſcruple, which is,
that I think too much on you, and that I deſire with much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
the honour to ſee you again. Though I have moderated
all my affections, I cannot reduce that I bear you, to that point,
wherein it is permitted we ſhould love our neighbour, that is to
ſay, as our ſelves, and I fear me, you have a greater part of my
Soul, then ſhould be beſtow'd on a Creature. Be you pleas'd to
conſider, Madam, what remedy there is for it, or rather, what
may be ſaid to maintain it; for as to remedy, I cannot believe
there is any, and withall that it is impoſſible, I ſhould not,

               <p>THe conſolation I have received from you was but proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the greatneſſe of my misfortune, and I have receiv'd
your Letter as a reprief that Heaven ſent me after my condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
I cannot call by any other name the newes that engaged
my return hither; and I aſſure you there are many ſentences of
death, that are not ſo cruell. But amidſt all my diſaſters, I
ſhould do ill to complain, when you honour me with a place in
your memory: and it were not hard, me thinks, to ſcorn the
favours of fortune, when one is ſo happy as to enjoy yours. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this conſideration, I ſhall be content to ſtay here, and not
upon that you mention, <hi>viz:</hi> that, <hi>it is better be an exile in
a ſtrange Country, then to be a captive in ones own.</hi> You ſee
but one half of my unhappineſſe, if you conſider not that I am
both together: and if you obſerve well, you will find, that
two things ſeemingly incompatible conſpire in me, to be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and a Priſoner at the ſame time. You will be troubled, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
to find out this riddle, if you call not to mind, that I
have taken up a cuſtom to ſay ſomewhat of Love in all my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
And whereas you tell me, I ſhould have here ſome Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which I ſhould not in <hi>France,</hi> I humbly deſire it may be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that; and give me leave to aſſure you, that I am extreamly
paſſionate in the affection I have to ſerve you. I were too ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
if, for a perſon, that doth ſuch extraordinary things for
me, I ſhould have only an ordinary Friendſhip, and I ought
to be in <hi>Love,</hi> though it were only with your generoſity. I
have been acquainted with the obligation I ought a Gentleman
and a Lady, (from whom I had receiv'd a many before) and
the pains they take to have an account of me. For the reſt,
they have ſacrific'd ſo much to <hi>Silence,</hi> that I have not ſo much
as heard them nam'd theſe ſix months. I know not whether it
be forgetfulneſs or prudence, and to tell you truth, I know not
what conſtruction to make of it. Beſides it ſeems more excuſable,
not to ſay any thing to a perſon whom one hath no remembrance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115945:45"/>
for, then to remember him, and not make any expreſſion of it.
I leave you to judge, Madam, how much what you have done
for me is hereby magnify'd, and how highly I am oblig'd to you,
for a large Letter, in a time when the reſt durſt not ſend me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have received the Letter you did me the honour to write to
me, with more joy then I ever expected to meet with here,
inſomuch, that though I have abundance of things in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
am at ſo great a diſtance from the place where I wiſh my ſelf,
am here in a languiſhing condition, and cannot without infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
difficulty get hence, yet was I ſatisfy'd as to all, when I
once perceiv'd your tenderneſs towards me. And ſince, as you tell
me, I have an intereſt in your Friendſhip, I look on it as a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
that out-weighs all others, and that thoſe on whom you
have beſtow'd Riches and Honours, have not been ſo well dealt
with as I. I aſſure you Sir, it is the only conſolation I have
receiv'd in this Countrey, where the continual want of health
makes me incapable of any diverſſion, and where I have not ſeen
any women unleſſe it were in the <hi>Prade,</hi> or upon the <hi>Stage.</hi> I
ſhall therefore without any violence agree with you, as to what
you ſay in diſparagement of the Ladies of <hi>Madrid</hi> in compariſon
of thoſe of <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> and before either your preſence or theirs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me thereto, I now ſubſcribe to whatever you can ſay to
their advantage; <hi>Innocency, Youth,</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> for which
you ſay you ſo much eſteem them, are Qualifications, which
here never met together, and which yet are not ſo common
where you are, but they give me occaſion to gueſs at the reaſon,
why you take that ſide with ſo much earneſtneſſe. If it happen to
be the ſame perſon I mean, I ſhould croſs my inclination and my
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115945:45"/>
judgment, were I not of your opinion, and acknowledg, that
though <hi>Xarifa, Daraxa,</hi> and <hi>Galiana</hi> ſhould return into the
world again, <hi>Spain</hi> would not have any thing comparable to the
other. The artifices they uſe on this ſide, and the illuſions
wherewith they would appear what they are not, cannot repreſent
any thing ſo beautiful; and the very white it ſelf of this place, is
not ſo white as ſhe. The moſt accompliſh'd beauties that are
here can no more compare with hers, then braſſe and ebony can
Gold and Ivory, and between the handſom faces of this place and
hers, there is a difference proportionable to that between a light
Night and a fair day. So that, Sir, whereas I have often affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that of all the Ladies, the Spaniſh only deſerv'd to be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I now acknowledg that a ſingle Lady of the Court where you
are, were enough to baffle them all, and that the only advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
they have over thoſe of that ſide, is, that they can be more
amorous: nor do I think that to be generally true, and that if
the ſame fortune which you meet with every where, attends you
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> you have taught ſome not to yield to them even
in that. But this diſcourſe ſhould have been reſerv'd for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
you promiſe me when I ſhall be neer you, the hopes
whereof augments the impatience I have to return. I therefore
humbly beſeech you, Sir, to remember that promiſe, and be
pleas'd to have a care that the multitude of your adventures
make you not forget any circumſtance of it. For my part,
whereas all thoſe that approach you do it to advance their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and beg either employments or penſions of you, I ſhall
never deſire any thing of you ſo affectionately, as the honour of
your converſation, nor do I beleeve you can beſtow any thing on
me of greater value. I know it is an iudulgence, whereof you
are much leſſe liberal, then any of the other, and that there are
very few perſons, to whom you eaſily communicate it; but the
paſſion I have for all yours, gives meadmittance into that n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOu have in five or ſix lines compriz'd all I can think accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in this world, and by promiſing me the preſence of my
Maſter, your converſation and Friendſhip, you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
all my wiſhes. Being put into this hope, there are no
difficulties I ſhould think inſupportable, the Sea will afford me
an eaſie paſſage to come and poſſeſs my ſelf of ſo great advantages,
and all the gallant men upon earth were once embarqu'd upon a
deſign leſſe conſiderable then this. But I muſt firſt diſſolve the
enchantments of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and overcome the deſtiny of this
Court, which hath decreed, that every one be ſtay'd here ten or
twelve months after the laſt day he propoſed to himſelf to be here.
This, Sir, is ſo certain, that having attempted this winter to
make an eſcape hence before this ſeaſon, the force of the charm
drew me back, when I was gotten forty Leagues hence, and I am
here to this day, as deeply engag'd as ever: However I expect
ſome good iſſue of what you tell me you have written in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
and if this adventure muſt be accompliſh'd by one of the
moſt gallant perſons in the world, I hope I muſt be your debter
for my deliverance: I know, Sir, it is not the nobleſt that you
have put a period to, but I aſſure you, it is one of the moſt
difficult and the moſt juſt. For, to be free with you, you are
ſomewhat concern'd to be tender of a perſon who honours you with
that ſincerity I do, and bearing the character you do, there is
nothing you cannot with more eaſe find, then affections pure
and diſintereſs'd as mine. Thoſe that are in ſuch places as yours,
are commonly treated like Gods; many fear them, all ſacrifice
to them, but there are few that love them, and they more eaſily
find Flatterers then Friends. For my part, Sir, I have only
look'd upon your ſelf abſtracted from all things elſe, I ſee in you
things greater and more ſhining then your Fortune, and ſuch
endowments as will not permit you to be an ordinary perſon.
You will find I ſpeak this with a great deal of experience, if you
reflect on the diſcourſe you gave me the honour to have with you
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115945:46"/>
in the meadow at <hi>Chirac,</hi> where having open'd your mind to
mee, I found in it ſo much reſolution, courage and generoſity,
as abſolutely conquer'd and took in mine. I then diſcovered you
had ſuch ſound apprehenſions of whatever men are ſurpriz'd by,
that thoſe things which they look'd on, as moſt conſiderable in
you, were ſuch as you made leaſt account of; nor could any man
judge more impartially of any third perſon, then you did of
your ſelf. I muſt confeſſe, Sir, that at that time, ſeeing you
perpetually engag'd on precipices, with a countenance cheerfully
confident, and not thinking <hi>Conſtancy</hi> able to hold out at that
rate, I found ſome reaſon to imagine you were not aware of
them. But you ſoone convinc'd mee, there was nothing in your
perſon, nor about it, which you moſt clearly underſtood not; ſo
far, that ſeeing two paces from you, impriſonment and death,
and ſo many other accidents that threatned you, and on the other
ſide honours, reputation, and the greateſt rewards, you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
all, without the leaſt agitation, and ſaw reaſons not much
to envy the one, or to feare the other. I was aſtoniſh'd to ſee a
man, that had been bred all his life in the boſom of Fortune, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with all the ſecrets of Philoſophy, and that you had
learnt Wiſdom, in a place where all others loſe it. From that
minute, Sir, I entred you into a Liſt of three or four perſons I
love and honour beyond all the world beſides, and made a great
additional of reſpect and eſteem to the paſſion <hi>I</hi> have ever had for
you, which I afterward caſt into a far greater affection. This is

               </opener>
               <p>YOu are, I perceive, as liberal of praiſes as of any thing elſe,
and not being able otherwiſe to relieve me in the exigencies I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115945:47"/>
am in, you would needs ſend me the faireſt words in the world.
I could make no better uſe of them, then to return them upon
your ſelf, and if I uſe not the ſame, I confeſſe I ſhall be much
troubl'd to find any to requite the honour you do me. Nor can I
but think, Sir, you writ them out of a fore-ſight of the neceſſity
I ſhould have for them, and by giving me ſo much reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
you, you have alſo been careful to furniſh me with materials
to do it. This favour obliges me to pocket up with patience, the
reproaches you load me with, and as I receive from you thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
I durſt not own, it is but reaſonable, I bear the reproaches I
have not deſerv'd. Were it not for that, I ſhould call you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for accuſing me for the extream deſire I have to leave this
place, and to know, why you call that hatred, which you
might have attributed to affection. I am as much as any man
acquainted with the delicacies of <hi>Spain,</hi> but if I miſtake you not,
Sir, you think there cannot be any ſo great for me, as to be near
my friends, and if I have quarrell'd with <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, by reaſon
of my Maſters abſence, you ſhould not think it ſtrange I am grown
weary of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and that I can take no pleaſure in a place where
I cannot have my health. But though this paſſion were as unjuſt
as you would have it, yet ſhould you not reproach me with an
injuſtice I am guilty of for your ſake, nor take it ill, I over-paſſionately
deſire to ſee you. If <hi>I</hi> were to ſtruggle with the ſame
inconveniences, in a place where you were, as I met with here,
they would not ſeem to me the ſame, when I were to encounter
them in your company; and <hi>I</hi> wonder at that expreſſion of your
Letter, where you tell me, that there are on that ſide ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
with whom, what ſeems moſt unpleaſant in life you would
think eaſily ſupportable. Aſſure your ſelf, Sir, <hi>I</hi> am alſo very
much eaſ'd by that kind of conſolation, and ſay you what you
pleaſe, being where you are, I can fear neither melancholy nor
neceſſity; when I call to mind that even in the Mountains of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne,</hi>
we have ever found with you, chearfulneſs and good
entertainment. There are certain treaſures in your perſon, which
I ſhall enjoy maugre all ill-fortune, and never know either po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
or ſadneſſe. This is that which makes me ſo impatient to
get out of this place, and if all my Friends did not oppoſe it, I
ſhould at my departure take the ſhorteſt way to find you out, and
would my ſelf take down thoſe e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

is a little more brawny, then that you ſhould expect any
conſolation for that; but it is not to be thought that you, whom
death it ſelf, as near as you have ſeen it, could not frighten,
ſhould be daunted at his picture. It is not by that poſterity will
judge of you. Fortune, who is alwayes unjuſt, will find out
ſome other more to your advantage, and for theſe effigies, ſhe
will one day beſtow Statues on you. All the changes ſhe hath
wrought in your life, ſeem to me like thoſe pieces of <hi>Tale</hi> which
is us'd on pictures, which alter nothing in the countenance, and
only change what is about the perſon. Thus does ſhe make ſport
with great men, ſhe loves to ſee them in divers ſhapes, and in a
breath ſhe advances thoſe into a Chair of State, whom ſhe had
expos'd upon a Scaffold. Sir, I hope, at my arrival, to find
that change, and for my own particular, <hi>I</hi> only deſire I may
ſoon have the honour to ſee you, and that all my fortunes were

He would have valu'd this honour more highly then the

praiſes of <hi>Homer,</hi> might he have had yours. In like manner,
Madam, the reputation you do me conſider'd, if <hi>I</hi> envy his,
it is not ſo much that he hath acquir'd, as what you have beſtow'd
on him, and he hath receiv'd no honours which <hi>I</hi> conceive not

your Gallant. Neither his own vanity nor his Flatterers have
ever advanc'd any thing ſo advantageous to him, and the quality

what would have rais'd me to a good one of my ſelf. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if I were as eloquent as you would have mee, I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to make no other advantage of it, then to gaine in your
Soule that place, which I know, by that I have there already,
and to perſwade you, to love me as you do. And if, this granted
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115945:48"/>
I were to deſire any thing elſe, it were in the beſt dreſſe of words
that can be had, to return my thanks to thoſe the Ladies, who, you
ſay, honour mee their remembrances. But particularly for one
of them, I would gather all the Flowers, and all the graces of
Rhetorick, and ſhould immediately write her a Love-Letter, ſo
full of gallantry, that ſhee ſhould bee ready to hearken to mee, at
my return. Since they are three, me thinks neither of then ſhould
take any offence at it. They were too too cruel to deprive me of
the liberty of my wiſhes, aud hinder me from building Caſtles in
the aire, ſince it is the only ſatisfaction I have. I begin now to
entertaine a ſtronger hope of my return, then I have had hitherto.
The pleaſure I ſhall find in leaving this place, will recompenſe the
diſturbance I have met with in it, and I feel, by way of advance,
the joy I ſhall receive when I ſee you. Thus, Sir, is there a
Mixtion of all things; good and ill are diſpers'd every where, and
when either of them is not at the beginning, it failes not to be at
the end. <hi>I</hi> am as yet uncertaine which way to take, but think I
ſhall take ſhipping at <hi>Lisbon.</hi> If it had been left to my choice, I
would have paſs'd through <hi>France,</hi> how dangerous ſoever it might
have prov'd. Not that I would be thought over-confident, or
take, as you do, a dangerous way, when I may take another;
but the ſhorteſt ſeems to mee ever the ſureſt. Beſides, to tell you
truth, I could never imagine my ſelf born to bee hang'd. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
I am commanded to take another way, and the perſons
whom you have given an abſolute power over mee, and ſhould
exerciſe it over the world, have ſo expreſs'dly ordered it, that I
may not ſo much as put it into deliberation. In the mean time,
while they charge me not to hazard my ſelf, they caſt me on the
mercy of the Sea and Pirates. Yet I dare tell you, I feare neither,
and am afraid more of the calmes which may delay my happineſs
of ſeeing you; I ſhall not trouble my ſelf for the reſt, if I may but
ſoon arrive at that, together with the opportunities, to make it
one day appeare by my ſervices, that you have made another man

               <p>I Have now an excellent ſubject to write you a Love-Letter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and I might ſafely ſay, that I paſſe the days without light,
and the nights without cloſing my eyes. At leaſt, this hath been
my courſe of life, ſince I left <hi>Madrid.</hi> In ten nights, I have
made ten days-journey, and am got to <hi>Granada,</hi> without ſeeing
the ſun, unleſs it be at riſing and ſetting. It is here ſo dangerous, that
the compariſon which <hi>Bordier</hi> made between him and ſome eyes,
holds no longer: for as they did, ſo hee burns all hee ſees, and
is no leſſe to be fear'd then the Elementary fire. I have made a
ſhift to eſcape him by the helpe of the darkneſs, having alwayes the
whole Earth between us. <hi>I</hi> reſt my ſelf at this preſent in the ſhade

furniſhes me continually with ſuch as are more: and <hi>I</hi>

and ſuch, as <hi>Xarifa,</hi> ſet neer her, would forfeit her name
and her Beauty. By theſe markes, <hi>I</hi> think, <hi>I</hi> have ſufficiently

is the Ocean and the Mediterranean ſea both together. You
will be aſtoniſh'd to find ſo far off a man, who takes ſo little

advice hath been given mee, that this ſeaſon is not the fitteſt

You will not think it ſtrange I ſhould commend a Country,

to make it appeare the moſt beautiful I can, and having
heretofore aggravated the ill I have met with in Spaine, ſince I
cannot retract what I have ſaid, I think my ſelf oblig'd to celebrate
to the greateſt advantage, the good I have found in it. In the
meane time, it may be much wondred at, that a man of ſuch a
Libertine humour as I am of, ſhould make ſuch haſt to quit all
this to find out a <hi>Maſter.</hi> But, to be juſt, ours is ſuch a one,
as no enjoyments are to be preferr'd before the honour and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of his ſervice; Liberty, which is thought the moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115945:50"/>
thing in the world, being not to be eſteem'd ſuch in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with his Highneſs. You know I am not much given to
Flattery, and it is one of thoſe remarkable endowments his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
hath, that hee cannot ſuffer it. But it muſt be acknowledg'd,
that beſides thoſe glorious Vertues he derives from the greatneſs of
his birth, his affability and goodneſs, the beauty and vivacity of his
underſtanding, the delight wherewith hee heares good things, and
the grace wherewith he entertaines others with them, are qualities
hardly to be found any where elſe at the height they are in him,
and were it not for the ſight of ſomething rare, that I wander about
the world, I need go no further, but ſhall do better to get neer his
perſon. I conſider every thing here with much more curioſity,
then I have of my ſelf, to ſatisfy one day that of his Highneſs.
And I doubt not, but, when I ſhall have the honour to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
him therewith, hee will bee more knowing in it then I am.
The prodigious memory of this Prince is one of thoſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I found ſo much encouragement in during my exile, for
I am confident I have a place there ſtill, ſince I have ſome time
had the honour to bee there, and I ſhall not bee ſo unhappy, as
to bee the only thing, it ſhould disburthen it ſelf of. His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
who could never forget a <hi>Tribune,</hi> an <hi>Aedile,</hi> no, not
a <hi>Legionary</hi> Soldier, once mention'd in Hiſtory, will not, I
hope, one of his Servants; and the whole terreſtrial Globe being
much better in his Imagination, then in any Map, how far ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I may go, I need not fear I ſhall go beyond his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.
However, ſince I owe all the honours, and advantages,
I have receiv'd to the mediation of your goodneſs, I ſhall entreat
you, to take occaſion to acquaint his Highneſs, how infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
I am of the honour to caſt my ſelf at his feet, and what
oriſons I dayly put up to Heaven, for one, in whoſe welfare the
whole world is concern'd. If this once granted, I deſire any
thing of you, it is onely that you bee pleas'd to ſee, that Time
deprive me not of any part of <hi>that</hi> affection, whereof you have been
ſo liberal towards mee. But obſerve where the exceſſe of <hi>my own</hi>
carries mee, in that it makes me diſtruſtful of the moſt conſtant
and moſt generous of mankind. But you, Sir, who are not
ignorant, that all thoſe, who love much, are guilty of certaine
agitations not ſtrictly juſtifiable by reaſon, will bee pleas'd to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

nothing of the paſſion I have for you, and though all the
Slaves of Chriſtendom are free, when they touch at that Coaſt,
I am never the leſſe yours for that. Be not troubled to ſee mee
break forth in gallantries ſo openly, the ayre of the Country hath
inſpird into me ſomething of cruelty more then ordinary,
whence it comes I am grown more conſident, and whenever I ſhall
treat hereafter with you, expect to find me as a Turk does a
Moore. However you ſhould not take it ill to bee entertain'd
with Love at ſuch a diſtance, and if it were but onely out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
you ſhould be glad to ſee the Love-letters of <hi>Barbarie;</hi>
there wanted in your adventures that, of having a ſervant beyond
the Seas, and as you have ſome of all qualities, it were but fit, you
had ſome in all Quarters of the World. I grav'd yeſterday the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of your name upon a mountain, not much lower then the
Starres, and whence are diſcovered ſeven Kingdoms; and to
morrow I ſend challenges to the Kings of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I offer to maintain, that <hi>Africa</hi> never produc'd any thing ſo
rare, and ſo cruel as your ſelf. That done, Madam, my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
here is at an end, but to go and ſee <hi>your friends,</hi> to whom I
intend to propoſe the marriage, which hath made ſo much noiſe
heretofore, and endeavour to gain their conſent, that there may
be no further delay in it. For ought I hear, they are people not
very eaſily acceſſible, I ſhall be much troubled to find them, I
have been told, they ſhould be at the bottom of <hi>Lybia,</hi> and that

There are ſome young ones ſold here, which are extreamly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
I am reſolv'd to ſend you half a dozen of them inſtead of
the Spaniſh Gloves, for I know you will eſteem them more, and
they are cheaper. Here may be had here for three Crowns the
prettieſt that can bee; it is but play with them, to carry away a
mans hand or his arme, and, your ſelf excepted, I never ſaw
any thing more agreeable. Be pleas'd to prepare Miſtres <hi>Anne</hi> to

ſhall ſend you them by the firſt ſayl hence, and I would to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
I could come along with them, to caſt my ſelf at your feet!
There it is, Madam, where they will have occaſion to be the
cruelleſt creatures in the world, and think themſelves the Kings of
all others. But the greateſt aſſurance I can give that the aire of
<hi>Africa</hi> hath inſtill'd ſome barbarouſneſs into mee, is, that I have
now written three pages, and thought to have finiſh'd my Letter
without ſpeaking of M. D. R. I aſture you, wherever I am, ſhee
is ever in my heart and remembrance, and even at this moment,
<hi>Ben che di tanta lontananza, li fo humiliſſima riverenza,</hi> and

While I am out of Chriſtendom, I dare not ſay any thing to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
de C— for Mademoiſelle do R— I believe ſhee will
never wiſh me any thing the worſe for that; I hope one day to be
out of her debt, for the pleaſure I had in hearing the adventures of
<hi>Alcidalis,</hi> by intertaining her with my own. I ſhall acquaint
her with things ſtrange and incredible, and for her Fables I ſhall
give her Hiſtory. Your <hi>Servant</hi> hath ſtill in my mind the place
his merit, and the affection hee honours mee with, may juſtly
claime. There is a Friend of yours, Madam, I love ſo paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that I forget my duty, and withall to tell you, how much I
honour and reſpect him; The infinite deſire I have to continue
in his remembrance, hath almoſt put mee upon an indiſcretion,
for without conſidering the motives, which might diſſwade mee,
there wanted but little that I had written to him, and had reſolv'd

felicity ſurrounds you, there are certain Houres when you envy
the condition of a wretched exile. If I can but get a Paſs, as I
hope I ſhall from <hi>Tetuan,</hi> and that the <hi>Alarbes</hi> who ramble

who have nothing barbarous but the name, and who,
notwithſtanding they are burnt by the Sunne, are yet fairer, and
caſt a greater luſtre then hee. 'Tis a Country, my Lord, where
women are not fooles, cold not cruel, they are all amorous, full
of fire and ſpirit, and, what ſome will think the better of, they
never go to <hi>Confeſſion.</hi> By the pleaſure I ſhall have to ſee all theſe
things, you may eaſily judge, my Lord, that it is not alwayes
Fortune makes men happy, and that there is not any ſo bad,
wherein there may not bee good emergencies, if a man can but
happen on them. While you are taken up with your good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

               <p>THis Lion having been forc'd, for ſome reaſons of State, to
depart <hi>Lybia</hi> with his whole family, and ſome of his friends,
I could not think of any place where he might retire with more
honour then near you, and that he is in ſome ſort fortunate in
his misfortunes, if they procure him the acquaintance of ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a perſon. He is diſcended in a right line from an illuſtrious
Lion, that about three hundred years ſince, reign'd in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115945:53"/>
Caucaſus, from one of whoſe grand-children, it is affirm'd
here, came your great-great-grand-father, who was the firſt of
all the Lions of <hi>Africa,</hi> that came into <hi>Europe.</hi> The honour
he finds in a relation to you puts me in hope you wil entertain him
with more mildneſs and compaſſion, then you are wont to have,
and I believe you will think it no diſparagement to be a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to perſecuted Lions. This will infinitely adde to your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through all <hi>Barbary,</hi> where you are already eſteem'd beyond
any thing on that ſide of the Sea, and where a day paſſes not but I
hear ſome one of your actions celebrated. If you can help them
by any invention to diſguiſe themſelves under a humane ſhape, you
will do them a tranſcendent favour; for by that means they might
do much more miſchief, with more impunity. But if that be a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
you will never communicate, you may yet ſufficiently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them, by affording them a refuge, and the aſſiſtance of your
advice. I aſſure you, Madam, they are accounted the cruelleſt
and the moſt ſavage of all the Countrey, which I conceive you
will be extreamly ſatisfy'd with. There are among the reſt ſome
whelps, who, by reaſon of their infancy, can only kill children,
and worry ſheep. But I believe in time, they will prove good
ones, and arrive to the vertue of their fore-fathers. At leaſt, <hi>I</hi>
am confident, they ſhall find nothing about you that ſhall make
them degenerate or abate their courage, and that they ſhall be as
well brought up, as if they were lodg'd in the ſhady Forreſts of
<hi>Africa.</hi> In this hope, and the confidence <hi>I</hi> have that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
let them want any thing which your generoſity might oblige
you to do for them, I do now give you thanks for the good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment

               <p>SInce my departure from <hi>Madrid,</hi> it hath coſt me, to get this
place, the travel of two hundred and fifty <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Leagues,
which ſignifie little leſſe then five hundred <hi>French;</hi> it is not
ill gone of a man that had a pair of Leggs ſo intractable, that it
was reproach'd to him he was not able to goe. I have thought all
this pains well employ'd, when at my arrival at this place, I
have met with the Letters you were pleas'd to ſend me of the third
of July. And though I was ſhown at <hi>Sevil,</hi> all the riches of the
Indian Fleet, and ſaw ſix millions of Gold in one chamber, yet
I may preſume to ſay, I met not with ſo great Treaſures as that
you ſent me. You may eaſily imagine, what ſatisfaction it was
to me, to receive ſo many aſſurances of affection from all the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amiable perſons in the world. And certainly, this joy ſhould
have been greater, then a man ſo diſaccuſtom'd to have any
could have born, if it had not been moderated by the newes you
ſend me of your own indiſpoſition. The colick could never hitherto
take in all my patience, but taking me that way, it hath made
a ſhift to conquer it, and grief ſeizes the moſt apprehenſible part
of me, when it aſſaults you. I am extreamly caſt down to
ſee my ſoul divided between two bodies ſo weak as yours and mine,
and that I am forc'd to be alwaies ſick of your miſeries or my own.
In fine, Madam, I perceive there muſt be found out for me ſome
more ſubſtantial remedies then the Ejacle; we ſhall be forc'd to
ſubmit to the advice of Phyſitians, and muſt reſolve rather that
one Vertue then two vertuous perſons ſhould miſcarry. Charity,
which is the principal, obliges us to have a compaſſion on our
ſelves, and ſince grief and ſickneſs are the effects of ſin, and one
of the curſes which attend it, we ſhould do all that lies in our
power to avoid it, and conſequently be the more careful of our
health. You are more concern'd then I to take this advice, for
mine is at this preſent in a better poſture then it was wont to be,
or the toil and agitation of the journey hath made me for a while

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſe apprehenſive. If you will enter into this courſe of Phyſick,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115945:54"/>
I will expect you in England, and carry you to all places accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the cuſtom of the Kingdom of <hi>Logres.</hi> I came out of
<hi>Madrid</hi> contrary to the conſent of all, with that little Prudence,
which you know the Philoſophers of that Sect, whereof your
<hi>Huſband</hi> is, admit in any thing relates to their pleaſure; and
in a ſeaſon when the Spaniards dare hardly creep out of their houſes,
I had deſign'd to run through the greateſt part of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to
ſpend the month of Auguſt in the hotteſt place of <hi>Europe.</hi> In the
mean time, I have, thankes be to God, effected my deſign, and
now that I am gotten into <hi>Portugal,</hi> I laugh at thoſe who ſaid,
I went to end my days in <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> To do you right, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
it is no ordinary reputation to you to have been able to
fire a mans heart ſo cold as mine. The Sun, which here cleaves
the earth, and ſcorches the Rocks, found it a hard task to warm
me, and <hi>I</hi> have not met with any inconvenience in this journey,
ſave only one night that <hi>I</hi> had not cloathes enough about me.
Three men, who came out with me, have been forc'd to ſtay by
the way. But for my part, neither heat, nor wearineſs, nor the
diſaccommodations of the Country for Travel, have been able to
ſtay me, and though I have met with many beds, worſe furniſh'd
then thoſe of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and many chambers more inconvenient then
thoſe of <hi>Panfou,</hi> and that I have not flept any thing, worth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
theſe three months, yet am I got hither more vigorous
and more ſound then ever. Think not therefore I am the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildy
creature you have ſometimes ſeen; I am quite another
man, then you can imagine me to be. I am grown ſix large fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in this journey, being extreamly Sun-burnt, my face grown
longer then it was, my teeth before cloſe, my eyes black, and my
beard of the ſame colour, and according to the imagination, I
have at the preſent of the Baron <hi>de Villeneuve,</hi> I am become more
like him, then Monſieur <hi>de Seriſay.</hi> That countenance, which
ſtood between mildneſs and ſimplicity, is grown into a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
poſture, and there's nothing about me which is not chang'd,
ſave that my eye-brows do ſtill meet, which is a ſignification of a
very wicked perſon. I hope within three or four dayes to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I can as well bear the trouble of the Sea, as all the others,
and aſſoon as an Engliſh bottom, which hath already taken in
two thirds, ſhall be fully loaden, we ſhall God willing take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the firſt wind. It muſt be acknowledg'd, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
very humorous in my Fortune; ſince I, who could not be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115945:54"/>
prevayl'd with to go ſo far as the Exchange in the beſt company
in the world, have now travell'd beyond <hi>Hercules,</hi> and it is above
a month ſince I have paſs'd his Pillars: and whereas I was not
able to endure a gentle wind in Madam <hi>de Rambouillets</hi> cloſet,
I am now going to challenge two and thirty in the midſt of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
and of Winter. That indeed is not the greateſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
but thirty Sayl of Barbary Ships continually cruſing about
this coaſt, do more frighten thoſe that go hence, and are more
terrible then a Tempeſt. I would gladly know, if there be any
Aſtrologer, who having ſeen me ten years ſince in St. <hi>Denis's</hi> ſtreet
in my round cap, could tell me, whether I run a great hazard of
rowing in the Galleys of <hi>Algier,</hi> or being devour'd by the Fiſhes
of the Atlantique Sea. But in caſe it be deſtin'd I ſhould be taken
by the Pirates, I wiſh I may fal into the hands of a famous Courſer,
which I have heard Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rambouillet</hi> ſomtimes name,
and whoſe name hath ſomthing in it, makes me have an inclination
for him. If Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rambouillet</hi> can gueſſe at him in four
times, and afterwards name him without laughing, I will give her a
little combe was preſented to me yeſterday, which had been made for
the Queen of <hi>China.</hi> However, I am not much troubled about my
ranſome, or that I ſhall be forc'd to redeem my Liberty, for the
Captain of the Ship hath aſſur'd me, I need not break my ſleep for
that, and hath ſworn he would fire the ammunition firſt. See
the excellent remedy I have, and conſider if I had not better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqu'd
my ſelf with an <hi>Anabaptiſt.</hi> But what is moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and is a very pleaſant occurrence, is, and I profeſſe I tell
you no lye, that I go in a Ship that hath no other freight then my
ſelf, and eight hundred cheſts of Sugar, ſo that if I come to a
good port, I ſhall arrive abſolutely conſerv'd, and if it happen I
be caſt away with all this, I ſhall have this comfort, that I ſhall
dy in ſweet water. Judge now whether I could have met a more
favourable opportunity. All conſider'd, I cannot but think this
voyage will prove fortunate to me. I hope the Zephyrs, which
are liſted among the mild ſpirits, will be merciful to me, and that
before this Letter comes into <hi>France,</hi> I may be in <hi>England.</hi> I
humbly beſeech you, Madam, to do me the favour to aſſure the
former of the two perſons, whom I juſt now mentioned, that,
though I ſhift places ſo much, ſhe hath ſtill that in my memory
ſhe was ever wont to have. All the objects that preſent themſelves
to me, put me in mind of her, and when ever I ſee a magnificent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115945:55"/>
Structure, a pleaſant palace, or a gallant City, or ſome great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece
of Art, or Nature, I wiſh, and ſhould gladly know
her opinion of it. That, wherein ſhe was ſo favourable to me,
raiſes me to a greater ſatisfaction of my ſelf, then ever I had in my
life: and the value ſhe ſets upon me, coming from ſo good a hand,
ſeems to me, to be beyond any. There could not any thing have
hapned more to my advantage, then to receive this honour from
a perſon that can ſo well judge of it, and of whom it may be truely
ſaid, never Lady ſo <hi>well</hi> underſtood gallantry, and the Gallants
ſo <hi>ill.</hi> I have onely to wiſh, that when this favour was done me,
it had been expreſs'd in other termes, then ſaying, ſhe gave <hi>el
precio de mas galan al Re Chiquitto.</hi> It had been, me thinks,
enough, to have ſaid onely <hi>Chico:</hi> but the ſtile of the Gentle-woman
who writ it conſidered, I wonder ſhe did not make it <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittico,</hi>
which yet might have been done to very good purpoſe,
and with ſo great a glory as I receiv'd, 'twas fit I ſhould be minded
of my meaneſs. I do all lies in my power, to juſtify her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
for I confeſſe that as things ſtand, I were too too ungrateful, if
I ſhould any way complaine of her, after the honour ſhe hath done
me in writing to me. Nay even when ſhe reproaches me with my
meaneſs, ſhe raiſes me above all the reſt, and with a ſheet of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
makes me the greateſt man in <hi>France.</hi> The Letter I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from her, is ſo excellent, and ſo full of ingenuity, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, I know not whether I ſhall have time and confidence
enough to write to her. I am never ſo proud as when I receive her
Letters, nor ever ſo humble, as when I am to anſwer them, and
conſider how far my wit is below hers. I would gladly, Madam,
ſay ſome thing here of that perſon, who may be ever commended, yet
never enough, and I could wiſh there were words as fair, and as good
as ſhe, to ſpeak of her accordingly: but there is no language in the
world can reach that, and the utmoſt effort of the imagination,
can only conceive ſomthing worthy of her. I thank Madam <hi>de
Clermont,</hi> that the extraordinary heats of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> have not
made me ſick, and that I have had good weather both times that I
paſs'd the ſtreights. I begge the continuance of her favours, and her
faith, that I ſhall never forget ſuch eſſential obligations. I ſhall
fully diſcover between this and <hi>England,</hi> how great the affection
is, ſhe is pleas'd to honour me with. They ſay there are in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
a ſort of people that ſell winds, but I think ſhe can beſtow
them; if I have it not alwayes a-ſtern, I ſhall quarrel with her:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115945:55"/>
with her permiſſion, I humbly kiſſe the hands of Madam <hi>Atalanta'</hi>
and though her Inconſtancy be one of the chiefeſt things I have
commended in her, yet I deſire her not to have any for me. I divide
a thouſand thanks between her and her Siſter, for the honour of their
remembrances of me. But, Madam, this is the fift Page I have
written, without writing to you, and when you have read ſo
many things directed to others, not ſaying any thing to you,
me-thinks it might be ask'd you, <hi>Why ſo mealy-mouth'd are
you for no Cake?</hi> You know it is your fault rather then mine. If
you have a mind to any, you need but ſay ſo, you ſhall have all
I promiſe you, and conſequently the ſhares of all the reſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I cannot forbear acquainting you, with the extraordinary
joy I take to underſtand, I am wholly in that mans heart, who
you know is ſo much according to mine. I know well enough,
it is no place of reſt, and think <hi>Africa</hi> affords not any more hot,
nor is there any Gulph in the Sea knows more agitation. Yet all
hinders not, but I am infinitely glad to be there, and think my
ſelf extream happy, to have ſo much room in the beſt heart of
<hi>France.</hi> If beſides there are only hands and feet left, I doubt not
but the hands are fair, and the feet clean, and there would be
ſome I ſhould kiſs with all my heart. But ſince he hath been pleas'd
to do me ſo great a favour, I humbly entreat him, to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the obligation, that he would permit you to get in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then any other, and at leaſt allow ſo much room there, as
half your body will take up; for to be free with you, <hi>Madam,</hi> I
cannot be entire in any place where you are not. If he have ſtill
the ſame inclination to well-doing he hath had, I know he will
not deny me that favour, and that it will be no hard matter, to
diſpoſe us ſomwhere aſide together. I ſtand in very much need of
ſuch an opportunity, that ſo I may have ſome private diſcourſe

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Thought I ſhould never have gotten out of this Country, and
my misfortune ſeem'd to have block'd up the Havens of <hi>St. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars</hi>
and <hi>Lisbon.</hi> I left <hi>Madrid</hi> upon intelligence ſent me that
an Engliſh Ship ſhould ſet ſayl from <hi>Sevil</hi> within ſix weeks, and
to avoid wayting there, and to come juſt at the time appointed,
I had gone about by <hi>Gibralter</hi> and <hi>Granada.</hi> In the mean time,
beſides thoſe ſix weeks, there are ſix other paſt, and yet I think it
will be a month ere ſhe get out to Sea. The impatience of being
ſo long in one place, forc'd me to leave that, yet making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to return, to come and ſee this. And though ſome had
written to me, that it was no convenient ſailing, yet I reſolv'd
to run a courſe of ſix ſcore leagues, and to paſſe <hi>la Sierra Morena</hi>
twice, only for my recreation. But, as good Fortune would
have it, while I was on my way, arrived an Engliſh Ship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I ſhall, with Gods aſſiſtance, venture my ſelf. I have ſtay'd for
her theſe three weeks, within two dayes ſhe will have in all her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and will be gone with the firſt wind. Fortune diſpoſes very
odly of me; after ſhe had employ'd me to travel through <hi>Spaine,</hi> in
the month of Auguſt, ſhe engages me in a voyage in November.
The Ship carries twenty five Guns, is ſtrong and well munition'd,
all, I think, not too much, for there are a many Turks upon
the Coaſt; and in this ſeaſon, I think, I ſhall not be ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as not to meet with ſome tempeſt, which I may one day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to you. This opportunity is queſtionleſs the greateſt I could
hope; it is an eaſier voyage hence, then from <hi>Sevil,</hi> and I would
not for any thing I had ſtaid there, and not have taken a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſee <hi>Portugal.</hi> I aſſure you, Sir, that <hi>Dom Manuel,</hi> and
the Lady <hi>Oſoria</hi> have a great Eſtate here, which if they could get
into, they were better accommodated then they are at <hi>Bruſſels.
Lisbon</hi> is in my mind one of the nobleſt Cities in the world, and
deſerves as well to be ſeen as any. It conſiſts of three mountaines
covered with Houſes and gardens, which have a River of three
leagues breadth, for a looking-glaſs to ſee them in, and that part
of the City which is under <hi>Tagus,</hi> ſeems not leſſe beautiful then
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115945:56"/>
that which is on the ſhore. Yet I think it tedious ſtaying here,
for I have not receiv'd a Letter ſince my coming, and have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of any thing. They are acquainted here with no other
<hi>France,</hi> then the <hi>Antarctick.</hi> The greateſt part of thoſe I ſee
here, are men of the other world, and ordinarily, you have
more news here of <hi>Cape Vert,</hi> and <hi>Brazil,</hi> then from <hi>Paris,</hi> or
<hi>Flanders:</hi> So that though it ſhould be ſome ſatisfaction to me,
to be in the Marmalade-Country, where I have a Miſtreſſe ſweeter
then it, yet all will not do, and I pray as heartily for a departure,
as if I were in <hi>Norway.</hi> Spaniſh adventures are ſtrange things; I
have continu'd in it as chaſt as a young Gentle-woman, whom I
believe you ſee every night, and yet notwithſtanding all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
I am able to ſhew you one day Love-letters in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of <hi>Caſtile, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Andaluſia;</hi> and if a black-Moor-Lady,
who lives over againſt me, could write, I ſhould ſhew you
ſome in that of <hi>Guinny:</hi> but I hope the winds will blow over all
theſe affections, and bring me to a place, where I have others
more ſolid, and more ſettled. I leave you, who alone make up the
greateſt part of them, to judg with what impatience <hi>I</hi> deſire that
happineſs. And <hi>I</hi> dare further aſſure you, I ſhall never quit Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
with ſo much pleaſure, as when I come to wait on you
again; and I, who had ever ſecur'd my ſelf from the droopings,
diſturbances, and diſcontents of <hi>Love,</hi> do now meet with them all
in <hi>Friendship.</hi> Sir, I think you will credit me, and be eaſily
perſwaded, that a man on whom you have conferr'd ſo many good
things, and whom you have taught a many more, cannot want the
reſentment he ought to have thereof. Conſtancy and Gratitude are
two Vertues I have learn'd of you, which I cannot better employ
then towards you: and when, out of an extraordinary generoſity,
I ſhall have payd you twice over what I owe you, yet were I not
quite diſcharged, and I ſhould be ſtill endebted to you for that very
generoſity, ſince I had acquir'd it through your acquaintance. It
is not therefore my intention to be diſcharg'd from a perſon to
whom I take ſo much pleaſure to be beholding; and beſides that my

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>TO ſatisfy you that I think your excuſe very allowable, I ſhall
alſo make uſe of it; it is more requiſite for me then for you,
and you ſhould not think it ſtrange, that I, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
leſs wit, and at this preſent, leſſe time then you, ſhould
alledge it in my neceſſity. You will eaſily be perſwaded when you
underſtand, that it is reported this day, we ſhall be gone within
five: ſo that I muſt buy a Bed, Quilts, Coverlets, a little
flock of ſheep, twenty Cowes and Oxen, fifty Pullets, and a
certain number of ſuch Cats as they keep in Lockers; for the
Captain will not find the Paſſengers entertainment. Beſides all
this, I am to write to <hi>Sevil,</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi> to
<hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Friends,</hi> to <hi>Merchants,</hi> to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> (of State)
to my female acquaintances and <hi>Miſtreſſes,</hi> and what troubles
me above all, I have every day to anſwer a Love-letter written in
<hi>Portuguez,</hi> which I profeſſe, I can neither read nor underſtand.
Judge now, whether ever man was ſo overwhelm'd with buſineſs,
and if I can hope to return you a Letter that ſhall requite yours,
when I cannot do it with all the aſſiſtance of leiſure. It hath
brought with it all the conſolation, which a fair-condition'd and
a good friend is capable of, and hath in my opinion, wrought
in me a wonderful effect, having ſhaken off the melancholy I was
in, by reaſon of not hearing from my Father and Friends in
<hi>France.</hi> I wonder I receive nothing by the Ordinary. Though
I tell you of a departure within five dayes, yet forbear not to write
to me, for, as you know, the dayes of this Country are not of
four and twenty hours, and thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> are not much longer
then they are at Norway, I could wiſh the Knight of the round-Table
were in an humour to come hither, for I know not what
more magnificent title to give him; and it muſt be confeſs'd no
man can be more ingenious then you to find him excellent titles,
and certainly he can never meet with a better opportunity. Beſides
that the Ships at St. <hi>Lucars</hi> are farther off by four and twenty
Leagues, I believe it will be fifteen dayes ere they be gone, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115945:57"/>
ſo he may triumph over divers nations, and after he ſhall have
ſet on fire ſo many <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Beauties, melt down the <hi>Portughe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.</hi>
Certainly if I were ſo wiſe as not to love any one of thoſe I
ſee not, I could never have had a better time in all my life, then
the three months laſt paſt, abſolutely dis-entangled from all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and buſineſs, and hearing no newes, but what you were
from time to time pleas'd to afford me. The true Secret to gain
health and cheerfulneſs, is, that the body be in motion, and the
mind in reſt; this is a benefit of Travel: but commonly it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
quite contrary; when we think to repoſe our ſelves, we
take moſt pains. The trot of a jadiſh mule is not ſo tedious, as
the expectation of <hi>Carnero</hi> in the Secretaries walk, and the leaſt
buſineſſe ill manag'd, afflicts more then ill weather, or an ill way.
Aſſure your ſelf therefore, that I extreamly like the deſign you
have to undeceive your ſelf as to fortune, and to forſake her as a
dangerous Miſtreſſe; her careſſes and her malice are equally to be
fear'd, one way or other ſhe deſtroies all her Servants, and thoſe
who look on her favours as real advantages, are much more miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
then thoſe who take <hi>an egg for an Oyſter-ſhell.</hi> If I had
not ended the ſentence with that jeſt, methinks I ſhould have been
too ſerious for a man that is not wont to be ſuch, and beſides is
in haſte. When you have a mind to this retirement, I will
wait on you, and we will get into ſome place, where we will call
every beaſt as we pleaſe our ſelves; we will, like <hi>Adam,</hi> give
all things new names, and when we ſhall go contrary to all other
men, and call that ill which they call good, it may be we ſhall
be in the right. But till that come to paſſe, and while I am in
the world, I beg your utmoſt diligence to continue me in the
friendſhip of theſe Gentlemen. There comes not a commendation
from the Count <hi>de Maure,</hi> which I value not at a million;
number the <hi>Maravedis</hi> the Fleet may amount to, and reflect on
the wealth you have ſent me. If the Count <hi>Stufe</hi> hath the ſame
fortune with you, as he hath with me, he ſhould have ruin'd
you long ſince; for I cannot make my party good againſt him,
but he hath got ground even to my very Soul. 'Tis true, you
are concern'd in this loſſe, ſince it is the taking away of what is
yours, from one that is wholly devoted to your Service, and is,
more then any man,</p>

               <p>I Do not certainly know who you are, but I am ſatisfy'd, the
Letter I have receiv'd muſt needs come from a perſon of more

               </opener>
               <p>I Have read your Letter with all the content and ſatisfaction
that could be expected by any one from a perſon ſo coſtive as to
writing, and withal ſo deſerving. Methinks now there is not any
thing which I may not promiſe my ſelf from your Friendſhip,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115945:58"/>
ſince you have for my ſake taken a little pains, and you could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have given me a greater aſſurance you will make good thoſe
words you have ſent me, then that you have written them. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I cannot but be troubled to think, that amidſt all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of tenderneſs, there is ſome occaſion for which you could
with me hang'd. To be free with yon, Sir, methinks it ſpeaks
ſome flaw in the affection you bear me, and I think, without ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much on punctilio's, I ought to take it ill. However I run
ſo much hazard of it otherwiſe, and I wiſh with ſo much paſſion,
that you had all your merits can pretend to; that if there wanted
nothing elſe to gain a Kingdom, I deal ſincerely with you, I
think I ſhould be as willing you ſhould have it, as you can be
your ſelf. I ſhould more eaſily pardon Fortune that affront,
then what ſhe puts upon you, in not granting what you might
juſtly claim, and denying you the title ſhe hath beſtow'd on
Monſieur <hi>du Bellay.</hi> But ſince the buſineſſe ſticks not there, and
that it is poſſible I may have a hundred Crowns of Martyrdom,
yet you not get one of Soveraignety, another courſe muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and without hazarding the lives of your friends, you muſt
owe this honour to none but your ſelf. I aſſure you, that while I
ramble through ſo many Kingdomes, I ever think of you, and
ſhall endeavou to lay ſome plot which you may one day put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
Not long ſince, I ſaws even Kingdomes at one ſight,
whereof there were four in <hi>Africa,</hi> which I wiſh'd yours, and
which it is a great pity you ſhould ſuffer to continue in the hands
of the Moors. But if you like not the air of <hi>Barbary,</hi> there is
newes come that the Iſland of <hi>Madera</hi> is upon ſome thoughts of
revolting, and that it will beſtow it ſelf on the firſt that ſhall
maintain it againſt the Tyranny of the Spaniards. Imagine with
your ſelf. I pray you, the pleaſure there is in having a Kingdom
of <hi>Sugar,</hi> and if it be not likely our converſation there will be
full of <hi>ſweetneſs.</hi> How great and powerful ſoever the charmes and
engagement of <hi>Paris</hi> may be, yet, if I miſtake you not, they
cannot divert you from laying both hands on ſuch an opportunity;
and that if any thing ſtays you, it muſt be the inconveniences of
Travel, and the trouble it is to riſe betimes in the morning. But,
Sir, Conquerours cannot alwayly till eleven of the clock; <hi>Crownes</hi>
are not gain'd without toile; nay even thoſe that are made of
<hi>Laurels</hi> and <hi>Myrtles</hi> are bought at a dear rate; and Glory expects
that her Suitors ſhould ſuffer for her. I muſt needs confeſs, it is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115945:59"/>
almoſt a miracle to me, that <hi>Fame</hi> ſhould not have br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

tidings of you, before I had the honour to receive them from your
ſelf; and me thinks I am farther then I thought I could have gone,
when I conſider I am in a Country where you are not known. Suffer
not a reputation ſo juſt as yours, to admit any limits, nor ſtop
at the bottom of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> mountaines, over which that of
ſo many others hath flown; come your ſelf and make it's way,
and if the <hi>Gazette</hi> ſayes nothing of you, let <hi>History</hi> do it. As
for that, which ſome would needs oblige you to take ill from me,
which is, that I had given you the quality of a <hi>Squire;</hi> I aſſure
you, Sir, you had no great reaſon to be offended at it. I ſhall
make it appear to you, that <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> under the title
of the <hi>Squire of the Sea,</hi> accompliſh'd his nobleſt adventures;
and that <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> while he was yet called the <hi>Squire
of the burning Sword,</hi> kill'd a great Lion, and reliev'd King
<hi>Magadan:</hi> but theſe are artifices of the Gentlewoman you know,
who having ſworn my ruine, is troubled to ſee me under the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of one of the braveſt men on earth. It will therefore be hard
for her to force me out of yours; for I profeſſe to you, Sir, (and
this I ſpeak more ſeriouſly then all the reſt) it ſhall ever be my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
by all ſorts of devoits and humble ſervices, to deſerve
the honour of your affection. Methinks it were a great want of
judgment, generoſity, and vertue, not to love perfectly a perſon in
whom all theſe are in ſo high a degree, and therefore I, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
eſteem theſe qualities wherever I find them, muſt needs
acknowledg them particularly in you, where they are aſſociated
with ſo many other graces, and attended by ſo much Civility.
Be therefore, I beſeech you, aſſur'd, that as I underſtand you
better then any man, ſo ſhall I ever have a greater honour for
you, and while I am worth any thing, ſhall never be other
then,</p>

it is that they have procur'd me the honour to receive
one of yours; the very ſight whereof confirm'd me in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I had long ſince made of you, that you ſhould one day raiſe
a jealouſie in the Lady your Siſter and me, and deprive us of the

a thing ſo difficult, as to imitate in all things your noble Father,
who not ſatisfy'd with the reputation of one of the ſtouteſt men

better then any other. If you are ſo reſolv'd, my Lord, no

of pains it will coſt you, you neglect an opportunity to

you have almoſt forc'd me into a wiſh it may never end. See Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,

ills in the world; you have, by the bare pronouncing of three

that of not ſeeing you. I muſt confeſſe <hi>Madam,</hi> I fear you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

               <p>I Have had more leaſure then I could have wiſh'd, to ſend you
what you deſired of me at my coming away. The winds are ſo
far from carrying away my promiſe, that they have given me
occaſion to keep it. They have ſtaid me here already eight days,
which I ſhould have thought very long and tedious, if I had not
brought from London imaginations that ſhould laſt longer then
that. I aſſure you, you are much concern'd therein, and that the beſt
I have had, have been employ'd on you, or the things I have ſeen by
your means. You will haply gueſſe hence that I ſpeak not of the
<hi>Tower,</hi> nor yet of the <hi>Lyons</hi> which you brought me to the ſight of;
In one Perſon you have ſhewn me more treaſures then there are
there, and withall more <hi>Lyons</hi> and more <hi>Leopards.</hi> It will not
be hard for you to judge that I ſpeak of the Counteſſe of <hi>Carlile;</hi>
for there is not any other of whom may be ſaid ſo much good, and
ſo much ill. How dangerous ſoever it may be to think of her,
yet have I not been able to forbear, and to be ſincere with you,
I would not give that repreſentation which I have of her in my
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115945:61"/>
mind for any thing, though the moſt perfect I have ſeen in the
world. Shee is, I muſt confeſs, a perſon full of enchantment,
and there were not any other under Heaven ſhould command ſo
much affection as ſhe, did ſhe but know what it is, and carry
about her the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> Soul as well as the <hi>rational.</hi> But conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the conditions we know her to be of, we can ſay no more of
her, then that ſhe is the moſt amiable of all thoſe things that are
not good, and the moſt delightful poiſon that ever Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.
I ſtand in ſuch an awe of her wit, that it had almoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
me from ſending you theſe Verſes; for I know ſhe can judge
what is good, what ill in any thing; and that all the Goodneſs
which ſhould have been in her <hi>wil,</hi> is diverted into her <hi>Judgement.</hi>
But it matters not much if ſhe condemn them. I dare not wiſh
them better, ſince they were made before I had the honour of her
acquaintance; and I ſhould be much troubled to have prais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

part, Sir, I trouble you not with excuſes, but ſuch as are allowable;
on the contrary, I conceive you very much in my debt, and
ought very much to acknowledge it, that I am overcome to ſend
you ſuch as are not. What ever they are, I dare aſſure you they
are the firſt I ever writ twice. If you knew to what a height of
ſloth I am arriv'd, you would acknowledge my complyance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

               </opener>
               <p>BE your Letter ever ſo full of threatning, yet can I not but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the excellency of it, and admire with what artifice you
join Beauty and Terrour together. As the skins of Serpents
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115945:61"/>
preſents us with Gold and azure, ſo you would enamel the moſt
poiſonous expreſſions with the livelyeſt colours of Eloquence; and
when I read them, I cannot but be delighted with the ſame things
I am frightned at. You begin very ſoon to make good your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to me, that I was not to expect your favour any longer than
while I wanted that of Fortune. Now that ſhe ſeems to have rock'd
me into a little reſt, you will needs diſturbe it, and thereby ſhew
me, that, though I have eſcap'd Seas and Pirates, yet am I not
ſafe, and that you are more to be fear'd then all; yet could I not
believe, Madam, that my avoiding a quarrel with your <hi>Dwarfe,</hi>
ſhould engage me in one with you, or oblige me to anſwer a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
being guilty of no other affront then that of returning a
Complement. But if ſo be you think I have not acquitted my
ſelf as to that, what you call contempt, you might have termed
reſpect and fear; and conclude that the ſame Creature who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd
Monſieur <hi>de M</hi> — of his ſword, might very well cauſe
my pen to fall out of my hand. Nay though he had ſome cauſe to
complain, yet were you not oblig'd to protect him againſt me;
and if you wiſh me ill for his ſake, I may ſafely ſay you have quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd
with me upon the moſt trivial account in the world. But if
you are reſolv'd to perſecute me, all my excuſes will not be able to
divert you, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that I have eſcap'd ſo many dangers; the place where you are, will
be a perpetua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

never was I neerer Captivity or Shipwrack. However, Madam,
I would not have you imagine the flames of thoſe living creatures
you threaten me with, to be that which puts me into any fear.
It is long ſince I am proof againſt ſuch accidents, and, whatever
you may ſay, I fear Death more from your <hi>hands</hi> then from your
<hi>eyes.</hi> Of all the paſſages of your Letter, which I admire in all
things, I have made a particular remarque at the exclamation you
make, ſpeaking what pleaſure it had been to you, if I had been
taken by the Pirates. It ſpeaks certainly an exceſſive goodneſs in
you, to wiſh me for two or three years in a <hi>Turkiſh Galley,</hi> only
that there might be greater dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

curioſity of hearing from me how I had dreſs'd the Camels in
Barbary, and with what conſtancy I had ſuffer'd Laſhing with
Lathes. By your manner of ſpeaking of it, I cannot but believe
you would have been glad I had been ſpitted on a ſtake for half an
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115945:62"/>
hour, to know what kind of torment it is, and how a man finds
himſelf after it. But what is moſt remarquable, is, that you
make theſe wiſhes, after you have as you ſay, reaſſum'd the form
of a young Lady, and had acquir'd more mildneſs and humanity.
There is as little juſtice in all this, as in the Quarrel you would
have with me for <hi>Alcidalis.</hi> Be your ſelf judge, <hi>Madam,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being upon the ſame ſeas, and ingag'd in the ſame dangers
as he, I could forget the troubles I was in my ſelf, to relate thoſe
he had run through; and being orewhelm'd with my own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
I ſhould make it my Buſineſs to write his: And yet I have

                  </gap>one it in the midſt of all my diſtraction; I have written above a
hundred theets of his Hiſtory, and I have been careful of his life,
at a time when, I aſſure you, I was not much of my own. And
yet, <hi>Madam,</hi> I would not have you judge by this how diligent
I am to pleaſe my female<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> acquaintances. When I ſhall have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
you all ſervices imaginable, theſe appearances would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to you the leaſt part of that paſſion I have for any concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of yours. If you would know it well, conſider the cauſe
thereof, rather then the effects. But your imagination, though
admirable in it ſelf, is here too narrow, and if the world can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
any thing too great for your mind, and ſuch as it cannot
comprehend, it is the reſpect, the affection and the eſteem it hath
begotten in mine. Being equally forward to acknowledge the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
I receive from the other excellent perſons, you may well
believe that the Letter I have receiv'd with yours, brought me as
well an infinite joy, as an extraordinary honour. You know beſt
of any one, how farre <hi>I</hi> have ador'd the merits of him that writ it,
and he may put you in mind that in the time of the Civil warres
between you two, <hi>I</hi> have ſometimes quitted your part to take his.
But this laſt goodneſs, hath found ſomething of new acqueſt in
my heart; and ſince I have receiv'd it, <hi>I</hi> crave your pardon, if
there are ſome intervals wherein <hi>I</hi> love him beyond any perſon in
the world. But Madam, that you may not think that all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
I receive from him, are deriv'd to me, through your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation,
I am to tell you, that upon another occaſion, he hath
not long ſince done me a good office, you being nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in it. Which though it were not of the kind that I take moſt
pleaſure to receive, as being ſuch as hath given me freſh occaſion
to reflect on my croſſe Fortune, yet I take it as a great honour to
owe him thoſe obligations which I ſhould be aſham'd any other, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115945:62"/>
am glad to receive any expreſſion ſoever of his Generoſity. He
ſhall ſwear to you, when you mention it to him, he k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what you mean, and me thinks I now ſee him do it; but you
know his inclination and his humour who never forgot a good
turn to be done, and can never remember it when it is. Since the
honour your affection caſts upon me is the chiefeſt conſideration
that hath engag'd me in his favours, I humbly begge your aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
Madam, to render him the acknowledgements I ought, and
to requite him, at leaſt proportionably to my preſent condition. I
kiſſe a thouſand times, the feet of that incomparable perſon, who
would needs with her own hand ſuperſcribe the Letter you ſent me,
and with four or five words make a Preſent ineſtimabl, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was but too precious. You have juſtly call'd her the greateſt
Beauty and beſt woman in the world, ſince that at ſuch a diſtance
ſhe can raiſe up thoſe that are caſt down. I wiſh, ſhe, that hath
ſo great an influence over her, may one day find all the happineſs
which ſuch a Syſtem of Goodneſs, Beauty, and Vertue may claim,
though I ſee this wiſh is of a vaſt extent. They ſay the ſtarre
which I ſometimes call'd the <hi>Day-ſtarre</hi> is greater and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
then ever, and that it ſhines and twinckles through all <hi>France.</hi>
Though its rayes reach not the obſcurity wherein we are, its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
does, and, as I hear, the Sun comes ſhort of its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
I am glad the Intelligence it is mov'd by, hath loſt nothing
of its force nor its light, and that there is not any thing but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

               <p>I Cannot but imagine, when you writ the Letter you have
been pleas'd to honour me with, it was your opinion, that
he eſteem I have ever had for you, had gain'd you ſome repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the world; that upon all occaſions, I had given you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
aſſurances of the honour of my Friendſhip; and that in
conſequence thereof, I had lent you 2000. Crowns upon a Buſineſs
of great importance, and at a time when your credit lay extreamly
at ſtake. At leaſt according to the rate that you thank me, and
ſpeak of your ſelf and me; I have ſome ground to think, that not
minding what you did, you miſtook one for the other, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
put your ſelf in my place. Otherwiſe my Lord, you had
not writen as you have, unleſs it be, haply, that not conceiving
there can be any greater good in the world then to do it to others,
you think your ſelf oblig'd to thoſe who give you occaſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them, and imagine you have receiv'd the good offices which
you have done. If it be ſo, I muſt need confeſs, there is not any
man you are ſo much oblig'd to as my ſelf, and that I deſerve all
thoſe returns you afford me, ſince I have given you greater occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
then any man, to exerciſe your Generoſity, and to do
thoſe actions of Goodneſs, which certainly are to be eſteem'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all the wealth you have, or can ever beſtow on me. Amidſt
the great number of good offices I have receiv'd from you, and ſo

hath entertained me with more pleaſure then ordinary, be pleaſed
to give me leave to tell you, it is that where I conceive you ſpeak of
theſe two perſons which at this day make up the moſt ineſtimable
part of the world, and to whom, if they be not compared one to
another, there is not any thing under Heaven that may. When
ever I do but think my ſelf in their remembrances, there enſues
for that moment a ceſſation of all my ſufferings; and when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to my ſelf the faces of the one or the other, me thinks that
of my Fortune is changed, and that imagination forces out of my
mind the obſcurity it is clouded with, and fils it with light. But
a greater happineſs is, that being ſo far from ever hoping to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                  </gap>tions, I cannot but think my
ſelf much intereſſed therein, and am ſo happy as to believe what
you tell me as to that particular. I am well acquainted with one,
My Lord, who were not ſo eaſily perſwaded, were he in my place,
and who, after ſo great a diſtance for two years, would not live
in ſo much tranquillity, and ſo great confidence. According to
the ſatisfaction this faith affords me, be you judge, whether I
am to be much bemoaned, and if there be not a many whom the
world calls happy, are much leſs ſuch then I: Were it not for this, I
would not certainly ward that diſtraction which preſents it ſelf here
of all ſides, nor oppoſe the melancholy of Monſieur de C— which
I am fain to beat up perpetually, and which, to tell you
truely, is greater then is imagined. Beſides that, he is got into an
humour to let his beard grow, which already reaches his girdle; he
is fallen into a tone much more ſevere then ever, and ſounds
ſomewhat like <hi>Aſtolfos</hi> Horn; unleſs it be on ſome diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>immortality</hi> of the Soul, or the <hi>Chief Good;</hi> or to

               <p>YOu ought to have allow'd me ſome time to recover our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
before I ſhould be oblig'd to write to you, it being
not handſome, that when I had been ſo long a ſtranger, and

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lence hitherto; but though I avoided anſwering
your challenges, I cannot but make ſome return to your civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and notwithſtanding all my evaſions, you have found
ſome other means to bring me to reaſon. My condition indeed is
ſuch, that it is much more honourable for you to have reduc'd
me after this manner, then to have taken me in by force. It
had been no great reputation to you to overthrow a man already
caſt down, and on whom Fortune hath beſtow'd ſo many blowes,
that the leaſt can force him to the ground. The obſcurity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
ſhe hath caſt us, admits not of any art or defence; it would
haply fall out otherwiſe, if not quite contrary to what you ſay,
if you had ſet before my eyes the Sum you ſpeak of, and as deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as you ſee me, I might be confident enough to fight you, if
that light were equally divided between us. 'Tis a greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to have that of your ſide, then all the heavens beſide. All
the beauties that ſhine through whatever you do, proceed only
from hers, and they are her raies which produce in you ſo many
flowers. To do you juſtice, I have never thought any thing ſo
pleaſant, as thoſe which are the productions of your mind. I
have ſeen ſome of them on the borders of the Ocean, and in
places where Nature could not force out a paſſe. I have receiv'd
Poſies made of them, that have even in deſerts entertain'd me
with the deliciouſneſs of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> Though they had
travell'd four hundred Leagues, neither time, nor travel, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away any thing of their Luſtre, as being indeed ſuch as are
called immortal, and ſo different from whatever derives its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the earth, that it is with much juſtice you have offered
them to Heaven. and they ought not to be beſtow'd any where
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115945:64"/>
but on Altars. Take this Sir, as my ſincere judgment of them;
and when my curioſity, as you tell me, had tranſlated me out of
the ancient world to ſearch out ſome rarity, I have not met with
any thing can pretend ſo much to it as your Works. <hi>Africa</hi> was
not able to preſent me with any thing more new, or more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary;
when I read them under the ſhade of its palmes, I wiſh'd
them you all, and at the ſame time that I look'd on my ſelf as
one that had gone beyond <hi>Hercules,</hi> I found my ſelf far behind
you. What might have rais'd emulation in anothers mind, fill'd
mine with eſteem and affection, you then took that place you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
now, and accompliſh'd at that time what you think you
have yet to begin. Being ſo well acquainted with you, it is
hard for me to repreſent to my ſelf ſuch an image as you would
force upon me, or to imagine you ſo inconſiderable as you make
your ſelf. I cannot apprehend Heaven ſhould crowd ſo many
things into ſo little room. When I meaſure you according to my
imagination, I cannot afford you leſſe then ſeven or eight Cubits,
nor repreſent your Stature other then that of thoſe men who were
begotten by Angels. Yet I ſhall not be ſorry it ſhould be as you
would have me believe; amongſt the advantages I ſhall receive by
your means, I hope you will make our Stature famous; that
ſhall be henceforth thought the richeſt, and you will lift us up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
thoſe who think themſelves higher then we. The richeſt
Eſſences are put into the ſmalleſt Viols, and nature ſeems pleas'd
to infuſe the more precious Souls into the leaſt bodies, and the
more or leſſe celeſtial they are, greater or leſſer is the mixture of
earth. She enchaces the brighteſt Souls, as Goldſmiths diſpoſe
their more precious Stones, who employ as little Gold as they can
about them, and no more then is requiſite to faſten them. You will
undeceive mankind as to that groſs errour, of eſteeming thoſe moſt,
who weigh moſt: and my lownes, which hath been caſt in my diſh ſo
often by Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rambouillet,</hi> ſhall be my Elogie with her.
On the other ſide, I think the affection, which you ſay ſhe hath for
you juſtly beſtow'd; as alſo that of five or ſix other the moſt excellent
perſon the world affords. But I wonder you make it an argument to
perſwade me to give you mine, and that you ſhould think to gain it
by the ſame reaſons which ſhould make you looſe it; you muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be extreamly confident of my goodneſſe, to think I can love a
man who enjoyes all my eſtate, and hath obtained the forfeiture of
it. And yet I ſhall be ſo juſt, that it ſhall not hinder me, and I doubt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115945:65"/>
not but you are the like ſo far that I fear not we ſhall fall out for
that; they may very well have given you my place, yet ſo as you
ſhould not thruſt me out, nor indeed may it be ſaid it was great
if it could not contain us both. For my part, I ſhall do all that
lies in my power, that I may not be troubleſome to you, and ſhall
ſo diſpoſe of my ſelf there, as that I may do you no violence. Since
therefore ſo powerful a concernment is not able to ſeparate me from
yours, you may believe there never ſhall be any thing that can
do it, and that I am, at all Eſſaies,</p>

nor why they will needs expreſs that in three words,
which they may with three Letters? What is more to be fear'd,
Madam, is, that this injuſtice conniv'd at, will beget others;
here will be no difficulty made to ſet upon MAIS, and I know
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115945:65"/>
not whether <hi>S I</hi> will be ſafe. Inſomuch that having taken away
all the words of connection, the wits will reduce us to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Angels; or if that may not be, they will oblige us to
ſpeak only by ſigns. I muſt confeſſe there's nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
then what you ſay, that there can be no greater argument of
the uncertaintie of humane affairs. Who ſhould have told me
ſome years ſince, that I ſhould have outliv'd CAR? I had
thought he had promis'd me a life longer then that of the Patriarks.
In the mean time it comes to paſſe, that having liv'd 1100 years
in force and credit, after it had been emploied in the Treaties of
greateſt conſequence, and been honourably ſerviceable in our
Kings Counſels, it falls into ſudden diſgrace, and is threatned
with a violent end, I have now no more to expect then the
time when I ſhall hear thoſe ſad exclamations which ſhall ſay,
The Grand CAR is dead, whoſe death is of much greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
then that of the grand <hi>Cham,</hi> or the grand <hi>Pan.</hi> I
know, if one of the greateſt Wits of the Age be conſulted hereupon,
one I extreamly honour, he will tell you that this Noveltie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
a heavy cenſure, that we ought to make uſe of the CAR
of our fore-Fathers, as well as of their Land and Sunne, and
that we ought not to caſt off a word that hath been in the mouth
of <hi>Charlemaign</hi> and St. <hi>Lewis:</hi> But you <hi>Madam</hi> are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oblig'd to take it into your protection, ſince the greateſt force
and beauty of our Language is in yours, you ought to have a
ſupream power therein, and appoint words to live or die, as you
pleaſe. Nor do I doubt, but you have delivered this out of the
danger it was in, and by encloſing it in your Letter, you have
given it Sanctuarie, and a place of glory, where neither time
nor envie can ever aſſault it. Amidſt all this, I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
I was extreamly ſurpris'd to ſee you ſo fantaſtick in your
good actions, in that you Madam, who without any compaſſion
could have ſeen the deſtruction of a hundred men, could not ſee
the death of a poor Sillable. If you had been ſo tender of me as
you have of CAR, I had been happy in ſpight of my ill-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
poverty, baniſhment, and grief, could hardly have
faſten'd on me; and if you had not been able to rid me of theſe
evils, you might at leaſt have rid me of the reſentme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t thereof.
When I was in hope to receive ſome comfort from your Letter,
I find it more concerned for CAR then for me, and that his
baniſhment troubled you more then ours. I confeſſe, <hi>Madam,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:115945:66"/>
you do well to defend him, but you ought to be as careful of
me as of him, that it may not be reproach'd unto you, that you
forſake your friends for a word. You make no anſwer to any
thing I writ to you of; to thoſe things that concern me, you
have nothing to ſay. In three or four Pages you can hardly take
occaſion to remember me once, and the reaſon is CAR— I
beſeech you conſider me the more for it another time, and
when you ſhall undertake the protection of the perſecuted, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I am of the number. To oblige you to do me this favour,
I ſhall ever make uſe of him, and <hi>I</hi> aſſure you, you owe it me,

little piece of Earth, beſtow'd on you the whole Maſſe, you
could not have been more magnificent in your return of thanks.
The great <hi>Mogul's</hi> vine might be bought with the leaſt of your
words, and all the precious ſtones it is burthen'd with, cannot
boaſt ſo great a Luſtre, and ſo much light as the things you write.
This beginning, Madam, is very glittering, and thoſe, who
at any rate will needs write high words, would be glad to begin
thus that which they call a handſom Letter. But the Meſſenger
allowes me not the time; beſides that I have diligently read that
of your Lady Mother's and your own, I am reſolv'd not to be any
further engag'd with them. To deal truely with you, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be any thing more gallant or more handſom, then what I
receiv'd from her, and the miracle is, that a perſon that writes
but once in four years, acquites her ſelf ſo well, as if ſhe made
it her conſtant ſtudy, and had all that time minded nothing elſe.

               <p>NOw that your Letters are more to be admir'd then ever, I
confeſſe, I ſhould be much troubled to want them. Having
ſince my receipt of your laſt, loſt al hope of writing any that are
good; it muſt needs be a great ſatisfaction to me to receive ſuch;
nor is it any more then juſtice you ſhould reſtore me to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which you make me looſe otherwiſe. The great opinion I
have long ſince conceiv'd of your wit, had prepar'd me without
ſurprizal, for a ſight of all theſe miracles, and I was ſatisfy'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could proceed from it I ſhould wonder at, unleſſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
things mean and ordinary. But I muſt confeſſe it hath
attain'd a degree of perfection beyond any thing I could imagine,
and that I was never able to imagine what you have ſince diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.
I aſſure you, Madam, <hi>I</hi> ſpeak without flatterie, and
my indignation is not ſo far ſpent, as that I ſhould be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that humour. You are now gotten ſo much beyond your ſelf,
as you were before beyond all others; and the moſt inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Letter you now write, exceeds <hi>Zelidas</hi> and <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

though there were put with them into the ſcale both their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
In the very height of my anger, I have not made any
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115945:67"/>
complaints againſt you that were not accompany'd with your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
and one reaſon that now obliges me to a reconciliation, is
a fear I am in, that if I ſhould expreſs any thing of diſpleaſure, it
would be thought an effect of envy rather then of a juſt reſentment.
In the mean time, your heart knows whether I have not cauſe,
and without ſpeaking any more of it, it is there I would have you
make me ſatisfaction; beſides that having been tongue-ty'd ſo
long, <hi>I</hi> would not break forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> immediately into out-cries. I
only entreat you to conſider, what kind of creature I ſhould have
been, having at the ſame time loſt all hope of returning into
<hi>France,</hi> and the comfort of your remembrances and Letters. One
of theſe misfortunes was enough to cruſh me, but I am miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
kept up, by reaſon they are come together, and that the
one encourages me to ſupport the other. When after this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of your ill inclinations towards me, I reflected on the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of evil Fortune delivered me from, by hindring me from
falling into your hands; methinks proportionably to that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
baniſhment was no hard meaſure, and that at leaſt I ſhould
die here of a death leſſe cruell. But <hi>Madam,</hi> this comfort is not
ſo good but that I ſtand in need of ſome other, for I aſſure you
that Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — is not ſo ſad as I am, and that cloudy
black melancholy wherein you have ſometimes ſeen me, was but
the ſhaddow of what I now ſtruggle with. I humbly beſeech y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Goodneſs, in not permitting ſuch an impiety to be ſpoken of upon
her ground, but let her only forbid the mention of it in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and cloſet, for <hi>I</hi> know ſome confident and reſolute enough to
attempt it. For poor Madam <hi>de Chalais</hi> whom you expoſe like a
ſheep to my rage, is innocent as to this crime; ſhe hath erred on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through ſimplicity, and <hi>I</hi> ſhould rather complain againſt her
Miſtreſs, ſhould <hi>I</hi> quarrel with other then the Authors of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune:
<hi>I</hi> do ſeriouſly think it very ſtrange, that ſhe, who
is well acquainted with the charmes of eaſe, and the enjoyment
there is in doing nothing, ſhould call me an ungrateſul man, for
no other reaſon but becauſe <hi>I</hi> let her alone, and trouble her not
with ſuch Letters as ſhe ſhould heartily wiſh ſhe had never received,
when they come to be anſwered. Though <hi>I</hi> trouble not my ſelf
to take any notice of it, ſhe hath ſtill the place in my inclinations
ſhe ought to have; ſhe is according to her own deſire at the bottom
of my heart, in the moſt retired part of it, where ſhe enjoys quiet
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115945:68"/>
without noiſe. I do indeed love and honour her as perfectly as
ſhe deſerves, and when ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I read any thing that is pleaſant, eat
any thing that is good, or digeſt it any thing well, I think on
her, and wiſh her the like. But to the buſineſs Madam, you ſent
us a piece of news a while ſince, whereto <hi>I</hi> made no anſwer, becauſe
then I was ſomewhat vex'd, and it is ſuch, as, next to what
you write of the report, I have thought as ſtrange as any thing I
ever heard. Though I am as much as any man acquainted with
the excellencies of my Lady Marchioneſſe — yet I cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
admire, that, at a time when ſhe cares not for any man
living but her Cook and her Doctor, clad in the roote, as we
have ſeen her, and hooded with three table-napkins, ſhe ſhould
conquer a heart ſo hard to be taken in, as I imagine that of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe
<hi>de la</hi> — ſhould be, and ſend a Lover to ſigh for her in
the deſarts of <hi>Thebais.</hi> The young Squire you tell me of would do
well to follow him, or if he hath no mind to undertake ſo great a
journey, let him turn Hermit at <hi>Mont Valerien. I</hi> deal plainly,
inſtead of making thoſe demands you advance on his behalf, it
were better he held his peace, and would not ſpeak for theſe ſeaven
years: However, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſince it is your pleaſure, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
them. To the firſt, why being clad in blew he ſeems to be
clad in green, is one of the ſubtilleſt Queſtions I ever read of in

to get up before one of the clock, and not to be dreſs'd before three,

               <p>THough you aſſur'd me that the Iſle of <hi>France</hi> was not any of

of the female ſex, and there is particularly one I wiſh in
my power that I might inflict that puniſhment on her ſhe deſerves.
Though they were innocent as to any crime ſave that of an eaſy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to believe what is injurious to me, I ſhould find them
guilty enough, and be not a little troubled to have offended ſo
much againſt them. I have had much a do to apprehend what you
ſay of the <hi>Raven,</hi> and the <hi>King of England's Son;</hi> but if I
miſtake not, it is one of the wickedſt devices in the world; you
never did any thing againſt me I took ſo hainouſly, and I ſhal never
forget it till I am reveng'd. But to what height is the perſecution
arriv'd, and what may I not expect now that your Lady Mother
ſeems to declare againſt me? I was extreamly aſtoniſh'd when I
diſcover'd her writing, and found ſhe abus'd both me and my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And yet I cannot believe ſhe did this out of her own
inclination, and it muſt needs be that you forc'd her to write it
with a ponyard at her throat. All this, Madam, put together, raiſe
in me an extream rage, but the kindneſs I receiv'd from you hath
appeas'd me. I have found in <hi>Monſieur de Chaudebonne's</hi> Letter
the ſugar you thought to have put into mine, and have taſted it
with the greateſt pleaſure I ought. I muſt confeſs we have not ſo
good here; ſend me of it often, I beſeech you, I ſhall convert it
into good temparament, and contrary to the tenet of Phyſitians,
That all ſweet things turn to choller, it ſhall allay mine, which

               </opener>
               <p>WEre you not the moſt amiable perſon in the world, you
would be certainly the moſt abhominable, as being guilty
of a certain implacability which were inſupportable in any
other. You demand peace after the rate that others grant it, and
to decide a quarrel, you uſe words that might beget a war. <q>
                     <hi>I
know not how I came to diſhonour my ſelf ſo much; give over
your ſnarling, let me hear from you every week.</hi>
                  </q> This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is a ſtrange humility, and an excellent method to exerciſe
the Chriſtian Vertues. You command me further not to take any
thing amiſſe from five and twenty years to five and twenty years,
as if your favours were not to be expected, but when thoſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are open, and that there is requiſite a Jubilee to abſolve thoſe
whom you have offended. Thus far, Madam, had I proceeded,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115945:70"/>
when I received your ſecond Letter, which hath appeas'd me very
much, by acquainting me that you deſire not <hi>I</hi> ſhould be hang'd
unleſs you were preſent. It is certainly an infallible argument of
the good inclinations and the great tenderneſs you have for me,
that you wiſh not this accident ſhould befal me, unleſs you had
alſo the ſatisfaction to ſee it. When <hi>I</hi> had ſo long implor'd the
aſſiſtance of your wit to find out words that might allay my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs,
you could not have be thought you of better. For
know, nothing could more encourage me to continue at <hi>Bruſſels</hi>
then to tell me they wiſh me hang'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo that this place
which <hi>I</hi> have hitherto look'd on as a priſon, <hi>I</hi> muſt now conſider
as a ſanctuary againſt your perſecutions. <hi>I</hi> cannot eaſily cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it
what you tell me of Madam de — nor that ſhe ſhould take your
part againſt me. If ſhe have, Fortune is more righteous then
either of you, by hindring her Letters to come into my hands.
To be free with you, it is much to be lamented, that you have
ſpoild ſo good a nature, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall be more troubled that you
have corrupted her Innocence, then to ſee that you have condemn'd
mine. However it be, aſſure your ſelves, you cannot take any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
againſt me which are not unjuſt, and which <hi>I</hi> ſhall not
one day make you both repent. This, Madam, is not ſpoken out
of Vaine-glory, but of that confidence which ordinarily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
ſuch as deal uprightly, and is the effect of a good conſcience.
Were <hi>I</hi> conſcious but of the leaſt default, and had any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
your menaces, <hi>I</hi> ſhould not have theſe good intervals which
you ſee <hi>I</hi> ſomtimes have, and inſteed of curing others of the Spleen
<hi>I</hi> ſhould dy of it my ſelf. If <hi>I</hi> have cur'd your Mother of that
miſery, <hi>I</hi> ſhall willingly undergo what other ſoever may befal my
ſelf. The aſſurance <hi>I</hi> have of the honour of her remembrances, and
the affliction it is to me that <hi>I</hi> cannot ſee her; divide my happineſs
and my miſery, and <hi>I</hi> wonder not ſo much, that ſhe wiſhes to ſee
me above any one, ſince <hi>I</hi> believe not any man can be more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
then my ſelf, when <hi>I</hi> am but neer her. That Philoſophical
Friend of ours whom you have ſo opportunely remembred with his
little twinkling eyes, had them almoſt ſtarted out when <hi>I</hi> read to
him that paſſage of your Letter. To ſay truth, <hi>Zeno's</hi> ſoul would
have been ſtartled at ſuch an emergency, and that of Monſieur <hi>Mig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
afflicted and caſt down. Philoſophy, which hath remedies
for all other misfortunes, knows not any to qualifie the leaſt loſſe

it much a man ſhould do that for her ſake, which ſhe would

there I ſhould ever learn it, when <hi>Monſieur de Chaudebonne</hi> is

                  <salute>MADAM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I am extreamly troubl'd that you can give me no greater hope
of peace, and that you are never at a loſs, as to wit, ſo much
as when you are to do me ſome good. For knowing it, as I do,
capable of all things, <hi>I</hi> muſt needs think the default rather to be
in your will, and while I ſhall find you ſo litle favourable to me,
I ſhall have cauſe to believe you are not ſo good as you pretend to
be. I fear me the aſſurance your Brother gives of your Juſtice,
will prove rather an argument of your Tyranny, which once
ſtrengthened takes away the liberty even of complaint. Were he as
far from you as I am, he would haply be of my opinion, and
were I in his place, it may be I ſhould be of his. In the mean
time, Madam, whether it be an abſolute peace or only a Truce that
you afford me, I am glad to make my advantage of it, I have
already perform'd one of the conditions on which you give it me;
M.D. having propos'd another way to me how to write to her,
I could not but make uſe of it, though I was much deſirous my
Letter ſhould have paſs'd through your hands, for I hop'd it
might have been better'd thereby, and was reſolv'd earneſtly to
entreat you to correct it. It's not above four daies ſince it was
ſent, <hi>Monſieur Frotta</hi> who is yet here, having with much ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115945:71"/>
taken charge of it, For <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> I ſhall not
leave him, till I have brought him into <hi>Africk,</hi> which I hope
will be very ſuddenly, for we ſee Land already. But Madam,
I cannot make him happy till I am become ſuch my ſelf; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bring him to ſee <hi>Zelida</hi> till I have met with Monſieur <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat;</hi>
and it muſt be another ſpirit then what I have at preſent,
to expreſſe his joy, and his good fortune. To be free with you,
next to his Story, what you relate to me concerning <hi>Martha,</hi>
hath pleas'd me as much as any I ever heard; but it is but the
beginning thereof, her Fortune ſhall not ſtop there, nor would
I ſwear that we ſhall not one day ſee her Queen of <hi>Mauritania.</hi>
All which notwithſtanding I deſpair not but ſhe may be hang'd,
but it will not be ſo ſoon. I am infinitely glad for what ſhe hath
procur'd you from the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and that honours at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
you from all parts of the world. I could alſo have eaſily got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
you one of the Muſtachoes of the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and a
handful of the beard, and two of the grinding teeth of the King
of <hi>Fez.</hi> But ſince the death of his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
you would no longer hazard your Friendſhip among that
ſort of people, which obliges me to be more reſerv'd; for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you have often blam'd me for engaging you alwayes to
Lovers, ſuch as you care not for. If I am diſcreet for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
Madam, I muſt be ſuch for my own; what oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
ſoever Fortune may favour me with, I ſhall have a care
not to be trapann'd by her, and I ſhall live longer then I expected,
if the Prophecy of the ſage Enchantreſſe prove true. I humbly
beſeech her to believe, ſhe cannot more juſtly aſſume that title
with any one then with mee; to ſay truth, whatever ſhe does,
enchants me, <hi>I</hi> have ſpent a whole day in reading the four lines
ſhe hath written to me. <hi>I</hi> ſhall take her advice, and avoid <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dafilea,</hi>
as <hi>I</hi> would <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis.</hi> Give me leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
my moſt humble thanks to my Lord Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi>
for the remembrance he hath honour'd me with in a Letter to the
Count <hi>de Brion;</hi> as alſo to tell you how far <hi>I</hi> am troubled at
the indiſpoſition of Mademoiſelle <hi>Paulet.</hi> Her favour which you

you will, if ſhe ſaw how ineffectuall her advice proves, and that
<hi>I</hi> cannot avoid ſpeaking of other perſons in your Letters. She
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115945:71"/>
would utterly deſpaire of any good of me, and would, with much

find me as much as might be deſired,</p>

ſomthing from you: and me thinks the want of your
Letters is a misfortune able to ſhake the conſtancy of a Vertuous
man. I have with much impatience, theſe many days expected
that you would honour me with an anſwer of the laſt I writ to you
and which I put into the hand of your noble Lady. But now my
patience is quite ſpent, and <hi>I</hi> can no longer adjourn an humble
ſuite that you would put me out of paine, and acquaint me by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what accident hath hitherto depriv'd me of that happineſs.
You ſee my Lord, what aſſurance I have in your words, and how
great confidence I repoſe in your goodneſs, ſince I dare beg ſo
boldly, a favour I can never deſerved, if you had not promis'd it
me, and which I preſſe you to pay me with as much rigour as if
it were a juſt debt, though it be only an effect of your indulgence
and liberality. And ſince you have ever expreſs'd ſo much incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

ſee, that, in ſpight of Fortune you can ſtill practiſe it, and that
it is in your power to do him a Courteſie who deſires it of you.

               </opener>
               <p>I Have not paſs'd one Hour of the day wherein I read not the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you writ to me at midnight, and though I am not wont to be
much pleas'd with the courteſies are done me at thoſe hours,
yet I have entertain'd this with more ſatisfaction then can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd.
Having conſidered it well, I have found it not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from one aſleep, and am confirm'd in the judgement I ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
made of you, that at that time your mind is more vigilant,
more clear, and more vigorous than at any other. While I would find
out the reaſon of it, I ſhall not admit the leaſt ſuſpicion of any ill
of you, nor take notice as a ſtrange thing, that you keep Robin-good-fellows
hours. I am more inclind' to believe, your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
knows no night, and being, as it is, a ſpring of Light,
the obſcurity which makes others dull and heavy, cannot hurt it;
for when all things elſe are covered with it, that breaks forth with
greater luſtre, the ſhadow of the Earth being as unable to reach it
as the ſtarres. Though I expreſs'd my ſelf in termes yet fuller of
Hyperbole's, I humbly beſeech you to conceive me far from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much good of it as I have receiv'd from it. The choice it
furniſh'd you with of three or four words, which render your laſt
Letter more obliging then all the reſt, hath rais'd in me unhop'd
for enjoyments, and forc'd on me a joy I make ſome difficulty to
entertain, as being ſuch as I ought not to be capable of but in
your preſence. But, Madam, be pleas'd to conſider the extent
of your Empire, at the very moment that you writ and wiſh'd our
misfortunes at an end the <hi>Elbenes</hi> departed hence to find out ſome
remedy therein, the Heavens began to clear up, and gave us
greater likelihood then ever. Which ſince it is ſo, and that in you
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115945:72"/>
to do good and to wiſh it, is the ſame thing, I humbly beg the
continuance of your good deſires for us. I can eaſily imagine that
ſufficient to raiſe ſome fortunate emergency; your good fortune
will qualify the malignity of ours, and you can contribute more
then any one to that accommodation, which ſo many are engag'd
to bring about. But Madam, be pleas'd it may be ſuddenly, for,
to deal truely with you, I am almoſt out of my ſelf to ſee the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
that are at <hi>Paris.</hi> I do not think the Lady you mention to
Monſieur <hi>de Chaudebonne</hi> can diſcover the greateſt, when the ape,
who was taught to play on the Guitarhe, could alſo ſing to it. I
know where there are things far more extraordinary, and where I
may ſee greater wonders; beſides that, as to my own particular,
I ſhall ſhew you one beyond all, which is the change of my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
which I promiſe you, ſhall be if not as noble, equally
conſtant as yours. Fear not therefore Madam, that a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which you diſſipate at ſuch a diſtance, can ever come neer you,
and trouble not your ſelf for the loſſe of my Letters, when you
ſhall have me; I ſhall make you acknowledge I am better then they,
and find I have not put my beſt thoughts into writing. In a word,
I dare aſſure you, that unleſs it be in abundance of grey haires,
there hath happened no change in me which is not for the better;
though I doubt not but thoſe will fall with the cares that begat
them, and queſtionleſs I ſhall become quite another man then
what I am, when I ſhall be able to tell you my ſelf with how great
paſſion I honour you, and how much I am,</p>

ſo great a diſtance. You have indeed reaſon to believe me guilty
of ſome enormous offence, ſince Heaven puniſhes it ſo heavily,
nor do I wonder much you ſhould condemn me thereupon, nor
that you ſhould be deaf to the reaſons of a man that makes his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
ſo far off. It hath been the cuſtome of all Gentle-women
both Moores and Chriſtians to do ſo. Yet I ſhould wiſh, that
while you deprive me of your Friendſhip, you would not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
my diſhonour, and that you would not take ſo much paines
to accuſe me, only to clear your ſelf. You might with more huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
follow the example of Madam — and Mademoiſelle — the
former without alledging any reaſon in the world, broke off all
correſpondence with me on a ſudden, conceiving that in time
things would come to that paſſe. The other hath forſaken me but
lately; but as without diſhonour, ſo without noiſe, and growing ſilent
through pure wearineſs of talking, ſpeaks no more of me, neither
good nor ill. But however, Madam, if there be that little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of Juſtice in your mind as to think that Friends are not
to be forſaken without ſome pretence, I wonder you could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
you of no better, ſince you are ſo fortunate as to inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and have ever dreſs'd up your Fables with ſo much probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Beſides Madam, you have not judg'd ſo favourably as you
ought of the Letters you have ſeen of mine, if you think that
Monſieur <hi>Mandat</hi> hath receiv'd the more excellent. My judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of yours is otherwiſe, and, though I knew nothing of thoſe
you writ to others, I durſt ſwear you never writ better. It muſt
be a Goodneſs great as mine to ſpeak after his manner, and I am
the only man can celebrate the Satyres are writen againſt me. To

ſhould be done him, and it ſhould be ſome affliction to you to treat

I know you many times condeſcend to a reconciliation,
that you may take a greater pleaſure to fall out again. I am afraid
the light you ſhew me ſhould be a falſe one, and that this light is
but the flaſh of the Lighting, and the ſurpriſal of the Blow which
haply it will not belong ere I feel. If it be otherwiſe; and that it
is a true peace you grant me, I entertain it which ſuch a heart as
you would deſire, and with what conditions and Qualifications
you are pleas'd to accompany it with. But Madam I muſt have
this proviſo in, that you would acknowledge my Innocence,
and confeſs that you did not ſo much as ſuſpect me to be guilty of
thoſe crimes, which you pretended to accuſe me of. Till this be
granted, and you have made me full ſatisfaction, I cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
your demand concerning <hi>Chocolate,</hi> nor ſpeak of
Comedies, when my mind is full of Tragedies: Yet I
could not avoid laughing, when I read what you ſay, that
Monſieur <hi>de R is as fierce and full of blows as My Lord
Amadis.</hi> Your Eloquence is not ſo high flown as to raiſe any
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115945:74"/>
wonder in me, for I have ever foreſeen it. That which I am more
ſurpriz'd with, is, that you are become ſo infinitely pleaſant.
You may ſay what you pleaſe of Madam <hi>de S</hi>— I cannot enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the leaſt ſuſpicion of her fidelity. They are conſiderable
elogies of her Servant, that he is <hi>handſome, young,</hi> and a <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con;</hi>
but when all is done, you ſhall find ſhe will be ſimple enough
not to forſake me for him. It is ten years ſince, I have known
by experience how ſhe hath treated the handſome and the young;
and for the Gaſcon, it's a quality you will not number among
thoſe that ſhall pretend to any love from her, if you call to mind
I have heretofore told you that ſhe ſaid of one, that he was <hi>either a
Gaſcon or Picard.</hi> I am not much taken with his finding of <hi>epris</hi> in
her Anagramme, I have found <hi>priſé,</hi> which happens ſomwhat miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſly.
To come to the worſt, Madam, I can find here,
when I pleaſe my ſelf, a Miſtreſſe handſome as the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta
Briana,</hi> amorous as Mademoiſelle <hi>Arlande,</hi> and ſtrong
and fleſhy as Madam <hi>Gradafilea.</hi> I ſpeak ſeriouſly, one of the
ſtouteſt Whenches in all the 17. Provinces longs to be acquainted
with me. But Monſieur <hi>de Chaudebonne</hi> adviſes me not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
my ſelf with her. In the interim, I make this Letter too
long, where I thought to have ſaid but one word to you, and
Mademoiſelle <hi>d'A</hi>— would think it guilty of very little gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
ſince I ſpeak of ſo many perſons in it beſides your ſelf. But
Madam, how infinitely ſhould I be oblig'd if you would but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
me a handſome Letter for her! If you deny me this favour
grant me at leaſt another I beg of you, to let me know what
condition I am in with you, and whether you have prolong'd the
four years you had aſſign'd me to live. You ſhall diſpoſe of me as
you pleaſe; but to be juſt, you ought to own more humanity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

               <p>BEing ſo infinitely obliged, as I am to <hi>Madame de C</hi>— I
ſhould be aſhamed, not to have mentioned her; but in a
Letter wherein I ſaid nothing of your Lady-Mother, me
thinks I might be pardoned a forgetfulneſs of all the World. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it was ſhee writ the four lines in Spaniſh, <hi>of King Chiquito:</hi>
I am not well acquainted with her hand; but I know the ordinary
air of her writing, is ſo Spritely and ſo particular in her, that a
man cannot be deceived in it, as being ſuch as n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne can imitate.
For what concerns you, <hi>Madame,</hi> I now tell you ſoftly, and in a
meaner ſtile then the beginning of this Letter, and conſequently
the more to be credited, that I look on all; I receive from you as
ſo many Miracles. They are much beyond thoſe for which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
you ſo much heretofore, and which I thought the nobleſt in
the World; and though I am not much guilty of envy, I ſhould be
much troubled, there were any man in France could write as well
as you. <hi>Mademoiſelle Paulet</hi> is not pleaſed to honour me with a
Letter; The large Letters I writ to her out of <hi>Spain,</hi> I perceive have
tired her: I ſhall eaſily reform that, and it will be much more
eaſy for me, to avoid over-writing to her, then over-loving her.
The only man of whom I have ſaid nothing, ſeems to be only he
of whom I never ſhould, it being more neceſſary, I ſhould give him
ſome aſſurance of my diſcretion, then my affection: My ſpeaking
ſo often of thoſe that are about him, will ſatisfy him, that it is
not out of forgetfulneſs; that he is only unmentioned, and that he
can never entertain that opinion of me, as that I could forget a
perſon, whom I ought to honour and ſerve beyond all the World,
upon ſo many different accounts: But I know not why he ſayes,
we ſhall have ſo many diſputes about the Spaniſh; unleſſe it be that
having alwayes had the advantage of me in all thoſe, we have had
together heretofore, and what pleaſure it is to diſpute and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
he will needs prepare that entertainment for me againſt my
return by challenging me on a ſubject, wherein I have all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that may be. I preſume, <hi>Madmae,</hi> on your pardon, For
all I have added in this Letter, ſince it concerns ſuch as you love
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115945:75"/>
no leſs then your ſelf. Be pleaſed further to give me leave to tell
your Brother, that I love him as much now, as when I bid him
Adieu; and that I am his moſt humble and moſt dutiful Servant.
I once more <hi>Madame</hi> kiſs your hands for the honour, I receive by
your writing to me. I am not ſo much joy'd to be here my ſelf as
to find your Letter here; but if you can condeſcend to ſo much
goodneſſe for me; I ſhould wiſh they were ſomewhat leſſe eloquent,
ſo they were more paſſionate. I ſpeak ſeriouſly, you frighten me,
and when I ſee your mind ſo high-flown, me thinks it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I ſhould ever reach it, or have any place therein. Among ſo
many fair Words, let there be ſome good ones. Rid me of this
fear; for to deal truly with you, I ſtand in much need of, and in
ſome ſort deſerve ſomething, of your care.</p>

               <p>MR <hi>de Chaudebonne</hi> is guilty of the boldneſſe, I take to write
to you, as being the only comfort he could give me in the
affliction, he ſees me almoſt orewhelmed with: T'is true, my
my Lord, the trouble I take not to have found you here, I number
among the greateſt, I have met with in this Country. I prepared
my ſelf for this baniſhment, the more out of ſome hopes I might
ſpend it in your Company, and doubted not to find <hi>France</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you were; But this would have been too great a comfort for a
man deſtined to unhappineſs, nor is Fortune ever ſo favourable to
thoſe ſhee perſecutes. In the interim my Lord, I look on it as a
good preſage, that ſhee is pleaſed, we ſhould be at ſome reaſonable
diſtance from you; and have ſome faith, ſhee will be reconciled
with us; if ſhee once afford us the happineſs of your preſence. For
to be ingenuous, My Lord, I cannot imagine ſhee hath abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forſaken you, and there needs no more then her ſex to argue,
ſhee cannot have you; and that ſhee will ſhortly ſee you again.
But though you want her, you are not without that extraordinary
prudence, and height of courage, which attends you every where,
and which you have not long ſince ſo nobly expreſſed, that I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115945:75"/>

I ſhould not ask ſo confidently; but you know that in Triumphs
Soldiers are wont to jeſt with their Commanders, and that the
joy of a Victory permits that freedome, which without it might
not be aſſum'd. Confeſſe therefore freely, how long it is ſince you
have thought on little <hi>Erminia</hi> in the Verſes of <hi>Catullus,</hi> or thoſe

all the reſt, you ſhould ever be mindful of his <hi>Benedicite;</hi> for no
man had ever ſo much cauſe to ſay it as you, or was ſo highly
oblig'd to render thanks to the Lord of Hoaſts: To do you right,
the Conduct and Fortune whereby you have ſecur'd us, is one of
the greateſt Miracles ever were ſeen in War; and all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
ſo extravagant; that I ſhould put them into the Chapter of
<hi>Apparent falſities,</hi> were there not ſo many witneſſes, and that I
am ſatisfied nothing of Miracle can happen to you, which ought
not to be believ'd. The joy wherewith all you love here are fill'd
at this news, is a thing beyond all repreſentation: But can you
imagine, My Lord, that thoſe Perſons who were heretofore
raviſh'd at your ſinging and Poetry, muſt needs be now infinitely
ſatisfied, when they hear it ſaid that you raiſe ſieges, take Cities
and defeat Armies, and that the greateſt hope of good ſucceſſe in our
Affairs lyes in you. <hi>I</hi> aſſure you, this is entertain'd here with the

               <p>I Have ſhewn <hi>Monſr. de St. H— Monſr. de St. R</hi>— and
<hi>Monſr. de St. Q</hi>— that paſſage of your Letter where
you ſpeak of my Lord's menial Servants; I am to acquaint
you, that they have taken it very ill, and am conſident, that
<hi>Mr des Ouſches,</hi> to whom I have not yet communicated it, will
be of the ſame opinion. So that, were I to arme my ſelf againſt your
menaces, you may eaſily judge, I ſhall not want Friends, and that
my writing to you now proceeds not ſo much from fear, as from a
ſincere Affection, and a natural inclination, I have to obey you;
Beſides thoſe I have named, this place affords a many other gallant
Perſons, ſuch as it were a little more dangerous to quarrel with;
who take it not well, I ſhould take paines for your diverſion, and
think it unreaſonable, you ſhould take any, wanting their preſence.
And truly, my Lord, ſince your abſence ſmothers all their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
it were but juſt, you ſhould with no other then that of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them again; and that in the mean time you would not admit
any divertiſement. I can aſſure you, that whatever is taken here
at this time, hinders them not from thinking on you, and making
continual wiſhes for your return. The cold and ſnows of the
Mountains of <hi>Alſatia</hi> benumb them, and make them tremble
even in the greateſt Aſſemblies; and the fear of the ambuſhes of
the <hi>Cravates</hi> perpetually Alarms them in the midſt of <hi>Paris.</hi> But
what is moſt remarkable, and which will haply ſeem incredible to
you, is that I have obſerv'd <hi>M. de B</hi>— &amp; <hi>M. de R</hi>— melancholy
in the midſt of the <hi>Bal,</hi> and that upon your account,
and ſighing in the height of the Muſick. What judgment, My
Lord, or what advantage you will make of it; I know not, but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115945:76"/>
for my part, let them do what they can hereafter, I am confident
they ſhall never be able to give you a higher expreſſion of their
affection. Taking out the other day the laſt Letter, you honour'd
me with, and reading that paſſage where you tell me, that you were
upon your departure; inſtead of ſaying into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> I read <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.
Iron-armes,</hi> who, you know, is not wont to be eaſily mov'd
at any thing grew as pale, as a clout, and ſaid, full of amazement,
into <hi>Thracia</hi> Sr. and another who ſtood by, and is a little better
acquainted with the Globe then the other, could not but be a little
diſturb'd. I would gladly entertain your Lordſhip, with ſomthing
concerning your <hi>Spouſe;</hi> but I know not what to ſay of her, for
whatever ſhall be ſaid of her will be incredible, and there is not any
thing in her, exceeds not the limits of deſcription. Whatever you
have obſerv'd in her, that might raiſe love or admiration, is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
hourly, and there are daily diſcover'd in her new Treaſures
of beauty, wit and generoſity. But with all I dare aſſure you, ſhee
hath in your abſence behav'd herſelf, with all the circumſpection
you could wiſh. I know there is a certain report, which queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
hath raiſed in you ſome jealouſy; for I am not ignorant of
the humours of your <hi>Africans;</hi> and it is true, there is a young
gallant of a good family, and who may one day come to a good
eſtate, who waits upon her often; but I aſſure you, that all this
notwithſtanding, ſhe hath no other apprehenſions then thoſe of a
moſt diſcreet, and moſt reſerv'd Woman, and ſuch as you your ſelf
may have inſtilled into her. To be free with you, my Lord, if
your heart be not grown brawny among the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of all theſe Perſons might raiſe in you a great deſire of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and how ſtrong ſoever the charms of Fame may be, you ſhould
not think them ſtronger then theirs. Haſten therefore your return
as much as you can, and for a while at leaſt; let them be the objects
of your ambition; for though Fortune attended you with victory
even to <hi>Prague,</hi> I do not conceive you really in her favour, while
ſhee keeps you at a diſtance hence. There are no Conqueſts beyond

               <p>YOu think it ſeems, there's no more to do, then to write, and
ſpeak as ſlightly of it, as may be expected from a man that
hath nothing elſe to do, then to command twelve thouſand
men, and oppoſe thirty; but if you were taken up with the ſight
and conſideration of three or four Perſons that are here, you would
find abundance of other employment for your thoughts. Were you
in my place, you would think time as precious as I do; I would
to Heaven you were, that it might be ſeen how well you would
come off, with the aſſiſtance of that Conduct, which you are ſo
much celebrated for, and that miraculous prudence, whereby you
have eſcaped ſo many other dangers. For I am to acquaint your
Lordſhip, that when you have put a period to the War, you are
now engag'd in, you will be drawn into another more dangerous
one here, you ſhall deal with an Adverſary more gallant, and more
ſtubborn then the German; and you, who have delivered ſo many
millions of Souls, will have much a do to eſcape your ſelf. There
is no retreat to be thought on, and there needs no more to make a
total rout, then the very ſight of them. There is among the reſt,
a certain <hi>Iron-arme,</hi> the moſt terrible Creature the Sun this day
beholds. There is no armour can keep off his blows, he cruſhes
whatſoever he but touches, nor are all the cruelties of the <hi>Croates</hi>
comparable to his. I doubt not, but your Lordſhip knows whom
I ſpeak of, and that you have had ſome engagements with them
already; but conceive not, you ſhall find them ſuch as you left
them. Their forces are encreaſed very much lately, and their
power is come to that height that they are grown irreſiſtible; there
paſſeth not a day, but they get ſomething, though they venture
for it to the gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> they take, they kill, they plunder all
wherever they come; and while you are employed to defend the
Frontiers, they ſet the heart of the Kingdom on fire. Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at difference with a man, who they ſay, hath the diſpoſal of all the
Marſhal <hi>de la Forcès</hi> Troops. But now that I am forc'd to this
confidence, and that there are ſome here, who will maintain what
I write; I ſhall preſume to tell you, that it is a very ſad thing, that
your affection, which not long ſince was divided among the moſt
excellent Perſons in the World, is now become the pillage of a ſort
of Soldiers. I can hardly contain my ſelf, nay, I am at a loſſe of
all diſcretion, when I think that the place which the moſt adorable
Creature in the World had in your heart is now taken up, for the
Quarters of Colonel <hi>Ebron;</hi> that <hi>Madam de C</hi>— and <hi>Madam
de R</hi>— have theirs taken up by ſome Commiſſary or Major,
and that you have beſtowed mine on ſome wretched Lanſpreſado.
This conſideration, my Lord, puts us all here into an inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſadneſs; there is but one perſon hath a greater conſtancy then
the reſt, and would perſwade us not to believe, you can be guilty
of ſo great an injuſtice. Shee <hi>I</hi> ſpeak of is a Gentle-woman of
 — fair-hair'd, of a very clear complexion, more cheerful, and
more beautiful then the fair weather of this ſeaſon; and indeed
ſuch, as you ſhall not find three ſo handſome in all the Country
of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſeems to unite and centre, a complexion that darkens all things,
a mouth which all thoſe of the World beſide cannot ſufficiently
commend, as being full of attraction and charms, and is never
ſhut or opened, but with the keyes of wit and judgement. By the
deſcription I make of her, you will eaſily conclude her a beauty,
far different from that of Queen <hi>Epicharis;</hi> but if ſhee be not ſo
much an Egyptian as ſhee, yet hath ſhee as good a Talent as to
ſtealing as the other. For in her very infancy, ſhee rob'd ſnow
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115945:78"/>
and Jvory of their whiteneſs, and Pearls of their luſtre and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſhee took beauty and light from the Star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and yet there
paſſes not a day but ſhee gets ſome ray from the Sun, and is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd
to deck herſelf with it before all the World. Not long
ſince, in an aſſembly at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> ſhee took away the grace and
the luſtre from all the Ladies, nay from the Diamonds that cover'd
them, and ſpar'd not even the Jewels of the Crown on the Queen's
head; but took from them what was moſt beautiful, and moſt
glittering. In the mean time, though all the World perceives her
violence, none oppoſes it, ſhee does what ſhe pleaſes without any
fear of puniſhment, and though there are thoſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> who take
Dukes and Peeres the next day after they are married; yet are there
not any will preſume to lay hold on her: But though ſhe have a
cruelty for all the World; yet me thinks ſhee hath a great mildneſs
for what concerns you; ſhee hath commanded me to tell you, ſhee
hath not thoſe diſtruſts of you which others have, and in requital
thereof ſhee deſires you to ſend her ſix triumphant Arches, of
thoſe are left of your entrance; four dozen of publick acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the Poetical works of the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe.</hi> I adviſe
you to anſwer her deſire exactly, and above all things, to hold a
fair correſpondence with her; for if ſhee once endeavour to do you
a miſchief, your Life-Guard, and your Troop, will not ſecure
your perſon. <hi>Mets</hi> is not a place ſtrong enough to ſhelter you from
her power: But, my Lord, I conſider not that I entertain you
too long amidſt the great affairs you have, and that if I ſhould
make my Letter any longer, I fear you would put off the reading
of it, till this peace were concluded. I ſhould indeed be much
troubled you did not ſee the end of it, ſince what concerns me moſt,
is that there you ſhould not find the moſt ſincere profeſſions I make

               <p>SInce <hi>Diſcretion</hi> is one of the principal qualities of a <hi>Gallant,</hi>
I conceive that when I ſend you a dozen, I am much more then
out of your debt. Be not afraid to entertain ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
though you would never yet receive one; for I aſſure you,
you may be confident of theſe, as ſuch as ſhall not divulge the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
you do them: How glorious ſoever it may be to receive of
yours, yet hath it been no ſmall matter to have found ſo many of
this humour, in a time when they are all ſo full of vanity; which
indeed occaſioned ſo long a journey as to fetch them from beyond
the Sea. I need not tell you, Madam, that they are not the firſt of
that Country, that have been well entertained in <hi>France.</hi> But
theſe certainly are the moſt fortunate that ever came thence, and if
you but give them a reception, they need not envy thoſe who have
waited on Princeſſes and Queens. For, to do you right, Madam,
the Earth affords not any thing above you, and whoever were plac'd
in your mind might preſume to be in the higheſt place in the world.
I ſpeak confidently for a man that payes a <hi>Diſcretion;</hi> but be
pleaſed to conſider, that one <hi>Love-letter</hi> is little enough for a dozen
<hi>Gallants,</hi> and that thoſe for whom I write, at leaſt, thoſe of their

               <p>I could never believe it poſſible that the receipt of a Letter from
you ſhould add to my affliction, nor that you could ever have
ſent me ſuch bad news, as that you might not comfort me up at
the ſame time. I thought my unhappineſs at ſuch a point as could
not admit of any addition, and that ſince you were able ſometimes
to ſtrengthen my patience to endure the abſence of your Lady-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and your own, there could not be any mis-fortune which you
would not have encouraged me to ſuffer. But give me leave to tell
you, that I have found the contrary in the affliction, I have for
the death of Madam <hi>Aubry,</hi> which hath been heavy enough to
cruſh me, and wanted not much of ſpending the remainders of my
patience. You may eaſily judge, Madam, what an exceſſive grief
it muſt needs be to me to have loſt a friend ſo good, ſo conſiderable
and ſo accompliſhed as ſhee, and one that having alwayes given me
ſo many expreſſions of her affection, would needs do ſomething
when ſhee had not many hours to continue here. But though I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
not on my own concernments; yet could I not but infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regret a perſon by whom you were infinitely lov'd, and who,
among many particular endowments, had that of knowing you as
much as may be, and eſteeming you above all things. Yet I muſt
confeſſe, that if this diſturbance can admit any remiſſion, it is, to
reflect on the conſtancy ſhee expreſſed; and the fortitude wherewith
ſhee hath ſuffer'd a thing whereof the name would make her trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at any time. I am extreamly comforted to underſtand, that at
her death, ſhee had thoſe qualities which only ſhe wanted in her
life, and that ſhee ſo opportunely found courage and reſolution.
When I conſider it ſeriouſly, it is ſomewhat againſt my conſcience
to bemoane her, and me thinks it ſpeaks an over-intereſſed affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be ſad becauſe ſhee hath left us to better her condition, and
is gone into the other World to find that quiet ſhee could never
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115945:80"/>
meet with in this. I very heartily entertain the exhortations yo
give me thereupon, which is, often to con a leſſon ſo profitable
and neceſſary, and to prepare my ſelf for the like one day, I know
how to make my advantage of your remonſtrances, and this is not
the firſt time that I muſt acknowledge my reformation their effect.
The miſeries we have run through all this while is no ſmall prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for it; There's no better lecture to inſtruct a man how to dy
well, then not to take much pleaſure in living. But if it be not
impoſſible for the hopes that Fortune propoſes to prove effectual;
if after ſo many unhappy years, we may preſume to expect ſome
few fair dayes, be pleaſed to give me leave, Madam, to entertain
thoughts more divertive then thoſe of death; and if it be true that
we are likely ſhortly to ſee one another; let me not yet fall out
with my life. Where you ſay that you think me deſtin'd to great
things, you give ſo great ſecuritie of my life and give ſo happie a
preſage of the adventures that ſhall happen to me, that I ſhall not
be ſorry it continue yet a while. For my part, if deſtinie doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
me any thing that is good, I aſſure you, I will do my utmoſt
to get it. I will contribute all I can thereto, that your Propheſies
may be fulfilled. In the mean time, I humbly beſeech you to be
conſident, that of all the favours <hi>I</hi> can beg of Fortune, what <hi>I</hi>
moſt paſſionately deſire, is, that ſhee would do for you what ſhee
ought, and for my ſelf only afford me the means to acquaint
you with the paſſion, obliges me to be ſo much.</p>

thoſe of the Parchment you have procured for me; ſince thoſe of
that amount to ten thouſand Crowns. <hi>Monſieur de Puy-Laurens</hi>

And certainly when I conſider that conflux of Miracles, and that
diverſity of favours heaven has ſhower'd on you, me thinks, that
for which I now ſend you my acknowledgements, is the leaſt you
ever did me. The place you ſomtimes give me leave to take in
your cloſet, I prefer before that you have gotten for me, and I
think you cannot lay a greater obligation on me, then that of your

Conſider then, I pray, the iſſue of that expedition, which

of the Nation were not otherwiſe diverted, all were joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon that deſign, and all <hi>France</hi> was engag'd before one place.
Here on the contrary, we were forc'd to take this in the heat of a
many other Affairs, which took us up of all ſides, in a time when
the State ſeem'd to be abſolutely exhauſted, and in a ſeaſon wherein,
beſides the men, we had alſo the Heavens to fight with. And
whereas before <hi>Amiens</hi> the Spaniards got an Army together but
five months after that ſiege to force us to raiſe it, they had one of
40000 at <hi>Corbie</hi> before this War was laid. I am confident, if this
accident make you not a good French-man, it will at leaſt raiſe in
you an indignation againſt the Spaniards, and will exaſperate you
againſt a ſort of people that have ſo little manhood, and can make
ſo little benefit of their advantages. In the mean time, thoſe
who out of diſ-affection to the Governour, hate their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and to ruin one man could wiſh all <hi>France</hi> deſtroy'd; laugh'd
at all the preparations we made to prevent that ſurpriſe. When the
Troops we rais'd here had taken their march towards <hi>Picardy,</hi> they
ſaid, they were only Victims ſent to be ſacrific'd, to our Enemies;
that that Army would moulder away with the firſt Rains, and that
the Soldiers being raw and undiſciplin'd would run away at the
firſt of the Spaniſh Troops. Even afterward, when thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>roops
wherewith we were threatned were retreated, and that a deſign was
laid to block up <hi>Corbie,</hi> the reſolution was thought irrational.
They ſaid, it was impoſſible, but that the Spaniards ſhould have
furniſh'd it with all things neceſſary, having had two months time
to do it; and that we might conſume before that place many milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Gold, and many thouſands of men, to recover it haply in
three years. But when it was reſolv'd, it ſhould be aſſaulted in the
midſt of <hi>November,</hi> there was not any one that cry'd not out.
The beſt affected acknowledg'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was ſome precipitation in the

of a fear that our men ſhould not dy faſt enough through miſery and
want of bread, they would needs have them drown'd in their own
Trenches. For my part; though I was not to learn the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,
that attend ſieges undertaken in that ſeaſon, yet I ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
my judgement. I thought thoſe who ſate at the helm, had
ſeen the ſame things which I did, nay much more then I ſaw; that
they would not inconſiderately engage in the beſieging of a place,
on which all Chriſtendome had it's eyes; and therefore as ſoon as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115945:83"/>
I was aſſur'd that it was aſſaulted, I was in a manner confident it
would be taken. For, to ſpeak impartially, we have ſometimes
obſerv'd my Lord Cardinal himſelf miſtaken in thoſe things
which he hath entruſted to the conduct of others; but in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes
whereof he would ſee the execution himſelf, and which he
hath encourag'd with his preſence, we have never known him miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.
I therefore was ſatisfy'd, that he would over-maſter all
difficulties, and that he, who had taken <hi>Rochel</hi> in ſpight of the
Ocean, would eaſily reduce <hi>Corbie</hi> notwithſtanding the Rains and
the Winter: But ſince it comes ſo pertinently in my way to ſpeak
of him, and that it is three months ſince I durſt preſume to do it;
give me leave now, and take it not ill, if amidſt the remiſſion this
news hath wrought in your Spirits, I take my time to tell you
what I think.</p>
               <p>I am not of their opinion; who endeavouring, as you ſay, to
convert Eloges into Briefs, ſcrue up all my Lord Cardinal's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into Miracles; celebrate his prayſes beyond what thoſe of men
might or ought to aſpire to, and out of a deſire of having too great
things believ'd of him, advance thoſe that are incredible. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
am I guilty of that malicious baſeneſs, as to hate a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is above all others, nor am I carry'd away with the torrent
of general hatreds and affections, which I know to be many times
unjuſt. I conſider him with a judgement, which paſſion forces not
to bend either way, and I look on him with the ſame eyes that
Poſterity ſhall. But when within two hundred years, thoſe who
come after us, ſhall find in our Hiſtory, that the Cardinal of
<hi>Richelieu</hi> hath diſmantled <hi>Rochel,</hi> overthrown <hi>Hereſy,</hi> and by
one ſingle Treaty, as it were with a Trammel, taken in thirty or
fourty of it's Cities at a caſt; when they ſhall underſtand that in
the time of his <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were beaten and broken,
<hi>Pignerol</hi> conquer'd, <hi>Caſal</hi> reliev'd, all <hi>Lorraine</hi> joyn'd to this
Crown, the greateſt part of <hi>Alſatia</hi> reduc'd under our power, the
Spaniards defeated at <hi>Veillane</hi> and <hi>Avoin,</hi> and ſhall obſerve that
while he had the ſteerage of our affairs, <hi>France</hi> had not a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
of whom it got not either places or <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>attails; if they have
any French blood left in their Veins, or any love for the glory of
their Country, can theſe things be poſſibly read and not raiſe in
them an affection for him, and in your judgement, will they love
or eſteem him the leſſe; becauſe in his time that Revenue of the
<hi>Hoſtel de Ville</hi> was paid ſome what later then it ſhould have been,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115945:83"/>
or that there were ſome new Officers thruſt into the Exchecquer?
All great things coſt dear, great attempts prove too violent, and
ſtrong remedies weaken; but if we are to look on States as immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and to conſider the future advantages as preſent, if we caſt up
a right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhall find this man who they ſay hath ruin'd <hi>France,</hi>
hath ſav'd it many millions, by the bare reducing of <hi>Rochel,</hi> which
for theſe two thouſand years, in all minorities of Kings, all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
of Grandees, and all opportunities of revolt; would have
been ſure to rebel, and conſequently oblig'd us to eternal expence.
This Kingdome had but two kinds of Enemies, that it had need
fear, the <hi>Huguenots</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> My Lord Cardinal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the helm of affairs, deſigns the ruin of both. Could he
attempt any thing more glorious, or more advantageous? He
hath effected one, and hath not yet accompliſhed the other; but if
he had fail'd in the former, thoſe who now cry out, that it was a
precipitate reſolution, unſeaſonable and beyond our force to think
to break, and give a check to that of <hi>Spain,</hi> as we yet find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
would they not alſo have condemn'd the deſign of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
the Huguenots, would they not have ſaid, that it was to
no purpoſe to re-aſſume an enterpriſe, wherein three of our Kings
had miſ-carried, of which the late King durſt not think on? And
would they not have concluded, as falſly as they now do in
the other buſineſs, that the thing was not feiſible, becauſe it had
not been done? But let us conſider, I pray, whether it may be
attributed to him or to Fortune, that he hath not effected that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
Let us conſider what courſe he took to do it, and what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
he ſet on work. Let us ſee whether he wanted much of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
the great Tree of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and if he ſhak'd
not to the very Roots that trunk, which with two of it's boughs
covers the North and the Eaſt, and ore-ſhadowes the reſt of the
Earth. He went under the Pole to find out the Heros, who ſeem'd
to be deſtin'd to put the axe to it, and lay it on the ground. He
was the Spirit that animated that thunder, which hath fill'd <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
with fire and lightning, the noiſe whereof hath been heard
all over the World: But when this Tempeſt was blown over, and
that Fortune had diverted the ſtroak, did he ſit down content?
Did he not afterward put the Empire into greater hazard, then it
had been by the loſſe of the Battles of <hi>Leipſic</hi> and <hi>Lutzen?</hi> His
policy and his intrigues got us preſently an Army of 40000 men,
in the very bowels of <hi>Germany,</hi> with a General who had all the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115945:84"/>
qualities requiſite to work a change of State. But if the King of
<hi>Sweden</hi> would hazard himſelf beyond what a perſon of his deſigns
and quality ſhould, and if the Duke of <hi>Fridland's</hi> deſign was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
becauſe not put timely in execution; could he charme
the bullet that took away the former in the midſt of his Victory, or
make the latter invulnerable to the thruſts of a Partiſan? And if
after all this, to bring all things to a total ruin, thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Army of our Allyes before <hi>Norlinghen</hi> gave Battle at
an unſeaſonable time, was it in my Lord Cardinal's power, being
200 leagues off, to change that reſolution, and ſtop the precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe, who for an Empire (for that was the prize of that
Victory,) would not expect three dayes? You ſee then that to
ſecure the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to divert his deſigns, which are
now thought ſo temerarious, Fortune was forc'd to do three mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
that is, to bring about three great accidents, which in all
likelihood ſhould not have happened; the death of the King of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> that of the Duke of <hi>Fridland,</hi> and the loſſe of the Battle
of <hi>Norlinghen.</hi> You will tell me that he ought not to quarrel
with Fortune, for croſſing him herein, ſince ſhee hath been ſuch a
faithful Servant of his in all other; that it was ſhee by whoſe aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
he took places before they were beſieg'd, who hath made him
a fortunate Commander of Armies without experience; who hath
as it were alwayes led him by the hand, and delivered him out of
thoſe precipices into which he was fallen, and in a word, who hath
made him appear valiant, wiſe, and circumſpect. Let us conſider
him in the diſpleaſure of Fortune, and ſee whether he were defective
as to wiſdome conduct, or courage. Our affairs were not over
ſucceſsful in <hi>Italy,</hi> and as it is the fate of <hi>France,</hi> to gain Battels
and looſe Armies, ours was extreamly weakned ſince our late Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over the Spaniards. We were not much more fortunate before
<hi>Dole,</hi> where the continuance of the ſiege gave us occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no good ſucceſſe of it, when intelligence came that the Enemy
was gotten into <hi>Picardy,</hi> that he had immediately taken <hi>la Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle,
le Caſtelet,</hi> and <hi>Corbie,</hi> and theſe three places which ſhould
have found them work for divers months, had hardly kept them
eight dayes. All is a fire even to the banks of the River <hi>Oiſe;</hi> we
could ſee from our ſuburbs the ſmoke of the Towns they burnt us;
all take alarm, and the Metropolis of the Kingdom is in diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.
Upon this, news comes from <hi>Burgundy</hi> that the ſiege of
<hi>Dole</hi> was rais'd; and from <hi>Xain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onge</hi> that 15000 peaſants are
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115945:84"/>
revolted and keep the Field, and that it was much fear'd <hi>Poicto</hi>
and <hi>Guyenne</hi> might follow their example; Ill news come one in
the neck of another, Heaven is all overcaſt, the tempeſt falls on us
of all ſides, and there appears not from any the leaſt beam of good
Fortune. Amidſt all this obſcurity, was not my Lord Cardinal as
well ſighted as before, did he looſe fight of the North Star in all this
Tempeſt; hath he not held the rudder with one hand, and the
compaſſe with the other; hath he got into the skiff to ſave himſelf,
and when the great Veſſel, he was in, ſeem'd neer a wrack, hath
he not been as willing to periſh with it as any other? Is it Fortune
that led him out of this Labyrinth, or was it his own prudence,
conſtancy and magnamity? Our enemies are not fifteen Leagues
from <hi>Paris,</hi> and his are within it. Every day diſcovers ſome plots
laid to ruin him. <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> conſpire, as a man may
ſay, againſt him alone. Amidſt all this, what face hath that man
put upon it, who they ſay was ſtartled at the leaſt ill ſucceſs, and
who had caus'd <hi>Haure de Grace,</hi> to be fortify'd to caſt himſelf into
it, upon the firſt frown of Fortune? Yet all hath not forc'd him to
ſtep back; his thoughts were taken up with the hazards of the
State, and not his own, and all the change could be ſeen in him,
in all this time, was, that where before he was not wont to go
abroad without a Guard of two hundred, he is now content with
the attendance of five or ſix Gentlemen. It muſt certainly be ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledg'd,
that an adverſity born with ſo much courage and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
is to be preferr'd before much proſperity and Victory; I
thought him not ſo victor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous the day he entred <hi>Rochel,</hi> as he
ſeem'd to me then, and the journeys he made from his own Houſe
to the Arſenal, I look on as more glorious for him, then thoſe he
made beyond the Mountains, and which brought along with them
<hi>Pignerol</hi> and <hi>Suze.</hi> Open therefore your eyes, I beſeech
you, to ſo much light, envy not any longer a man who can with
ſo much Fortune be reveng'd of his enemies, and ceaſe to wiſh him
ill, who can turn it to his glory, and bear it with ſo much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
Forſake your party before it forſake you; nor are they a
ſmall number, of thoſe that were diſ-affected to my Lord Cardinal,
that are converted by the laſt Miracle he did. And if the War ſhall
end, as there is ſome ground to hope, it will not be long ere he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all the reſt. Being wiſe as he is, ſo much experience muſt
needs have taught him what is beſt; and he will direct all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
to render this State the moſt flouriſhing of any, after he hath
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115945:85"/>
made it the moſt terrible. He will bethink him of an Ambition
more noble then any other, and which no man reflects on; which
is, to become the beſt and beſt-belov'd man in the Nation, and not
the moſt powerful and moſt fear'd. He knows that the nobleſt and
moſt ancient Conqueſts are thoſe of Hearts and affections. That
Lautel is a fruitleſs plant, which affords at beſt but a ſhade, and is
not to be compar'd to the fruits and harveſts, which are the Crowns
of Peace. He ſees that it merits not ſo much elogy to add a
hundred Leagues to the Frontiers of a Kingdom, as to take off one
peny of the Tax; and that there is leſſe reputation and true glory,
to defeat 100000 men, then to ſettle and ſecure twenty millions.
So that this great Intelligence who hath hitherto been employ'd, in
finding out wayes to defray the charges of the War, in raiſing
men and mony, in taking of Cities and gaining Battails, will be
henceforth taken up wholly in introducing &amp; ſetling peace, wealth,
and abundance. The ſame head that was deliver'd of <hi>Pallas</hi>
arm'd, ſhall reſtore her with her Olive, peaceable, mild and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and attended by all thoſe Arts which ordinarily accompany
her. We ſhall have no more new Edicts; but ſuch as tend to the
regulation of Luxury, and ſettling Commerce: Thoſe great veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
that were built to carry our Armes beyond the ſtreights, ſhall
be employ'd in convoying our Merchants, and keeping the Sea
open, where we ſhall have no War but with Pirates. Then ſhall
my Lord Cardinal's enemies have nothing to ſay againſt him, as
they have hitherto been unable to do any thing. The Citizens of
<hi>Paris</hi> ſhall be his Guards, and he will find how much more pleaſant
it is to hear his praiſes in the mouth of the people then in that of
Poets. Prevent that time I conjure you, and delay not your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of his Friends till you are forc'd to it. But if you will needs
perſiſt in your opinion, it is not my endeavour to force you out of
it; but withal be not ſo unjuſt, as to take it amiſs that I have

three fingers below the meaneſt; my head is handſome enough,
well ſtor'd with gray hairs, I am of a gentle aſpect though my eyes
are a little mis-placed, and have a countenance ſimple enough for a
Country-fellow. But to make amends for all this, one of your
Friends will tell you, that I am the beſt company in the World, and
to love in five or ſix places at a time; there's not any he, can do it
with as much fidelity as my ſelf. If you can bear with all this, I

               <p>I Saw divers reaſons not to expect any Letters from you ſo ſoon,
and eaſily inferr'd that a perſon who had ſo many things to do,
could not write much. I was content to hear your name, and
Victories cry'd up here every week, and to buy all the news I could
learn of you. But certainly it was time you did me the honour I
have receiv'd, the inſolence of ſome people beginning to grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
to me, who preſumptuouſly gave out that the time of
their Propheſies was come, and that I ſhould ſhortly be rank'd
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115945:88"/>
among them as a private perſon. Nay there wanted not thoſe who
took this occaſion to tempt my fidelity. You cannot eaſily believe,
my Lord, what advantages I have been proffered, to induce me
to quit your party this winter, and to let out my clawes againſt
you twice a week. And yet though theſe offers have been made by
the moſt enchanting mouth in the world, yet have I ſlighted them
with that conſtancy I am obliged to have for a man of whom I
have received all things, and whom I find otherwiſe ſo much to
my humour that though hee had ever hated me, yet could I not
but reſpect and ſerve him. So that though I have at <hi>Paris</hi> thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
which they never want who aſpire not to the conduct
of Armies, and are not capable of thoſe high paſſions, which at
this preſent take up the better part of your ſoul; yet am I ready to
take my leave of all here when ever you ſhall command me, and
ſhall quit, to wayt on you, a perſon that is young, ſprightly,
and black. To do this I only want a handſome pretence, and if
your enemies, as I believe, will needs have their walls between you
and them, and oblige you to a ſiege, I ſhall not fail to be with
you; beſides that, not to flatter you, I had rather be beſieger
then beſieged, and the Spaniards are gotten ſo neer <hi>Paris,</hi> that
though I did not leave it for your ſake I ſhould for my own; All
the Bridges neer it are broken down, they are ready every hour to
draw up the chains, and at the ſame time when we are terrible on

when our affaires are declining on every ſide they proſper on yours;

               <p>I Know no reaſon you have to quarrel with me, unleſſe it be,
that having your armes ready you could fall out with all the

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115945:89"/>
long, you ſeek out occaſions of new differences. It's a hard thing
to be a Conquerour and juſt at the ſame time, and I perceive <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>
and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> are two vertues ſeldome lodge together in the
ſame inne. It is not many dayes ſince I writ you a letter ſo large
that I thought you would not have found no leaſure to read it, and
I do not find my ſelf guilty of having ſlipped any occaſion I had to
diſcharge my duty. Though I ſhould not, my Lord, conſider
the infinite obligations I owe you, and were not to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my ſelf to the perſon of moſt honour I have ever known,
yet could I not avoid writing to you, as being loath to give any
cauſe of diſcontent to a man who at preſent is the moſt to be feared
of any in <hi>France.</hi> Under pretence, that you have a many things lye
on your hands, that you do the buſineſs of a Labourer, a Soldier and
a General, while you are employed about the fortifying of a Camp,
and the taking of a City, to ſee order and juſtice obſerved in an
Army, and to make diſciplinable a Nation that had never yet
been ſo; you imagine that all others are at leaſure, and that none
but your ſelf takes any paines. In the mean time, I aſſure you,
that if I had nothing elſe to do here, then to hearken to thoſe that
tell news of you, and return it to others that enquire, I ſhould
not be much leſſe employed then you are, and have very little time
to write to you. Some who in other yeares were content with two
or three houres diſcourſe of you, ſpend now ſix in ſpeaking of
you, without the leaſt wearineſs. Thoſe who are diſſatisfied with
the Government, and thoſe who are for it, are equally inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to know what you do, and there are not any to whom you
are indifferent but thoſe to whom <hi>France</hi> is ſuch. While I write
this, my Lord, I hear the Treaty with <hi>Landrecis</hi> is concluded,
and that you are to march into it next Sunday. I praiſe God, and
rejoyce with you, that you have convinced ſtrangers it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
but that we may take ſome of their places, and that you
have diſſolved the inchantment which had hindred us from it for ſo
many yeares. <hi>Lovain, Valentia,</hi> and <hi>Dole,</hi> had perſwaded our
enemies that we ſhould never get any thing of them, and that the
moſt we could do was to recover what they had taken from us. The
moſt inconſiderable places ſeem'd to become impregnable aſſoo as
we came before them; our Armies, which did well enough upon
all other occaſions, were ruined and abſolutely diſheartned aſſoon
as they were engaged in a ſiege, and how great and victorious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
your Fortune hath been, yet was there no ditch ſo ſhallow,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115945:90"/>
no work ſo weak but gave it ſome check. In fine, my Lord,
you have exchanged that ill deſtiny, you have ſatisfyed thoſe
that would have ſent you back to <hi>Dole</hi> that they miſtook you.
You have, as I may ſay, made your Cannon be heard as far as
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the noiſe hath made the Cardinal <hi>Infant</hi> to retreat
as far as <hi>Gaunt,</hi> inſtead of advancing to the relief of a place, which
you were going to take from him. But what I look on as moſt
conſiderable in this Action, is, the Order, diligence, and ſecurity
wherewith it was done. The very day you opened your Trenches,
it might have been ſaid <hi>Landrecis</hi> was ours, and though <hi>Picolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi>
and all his Forces, which were ſuch a terrour to us the laſt
year, had brought along with them thither all the power of the
Empire, they could not have taken it out of your hands. We were
not wont to take that courſe for the reducing of places, and it may
be ſaid, that the firſt ſiege you laid was the firſt regular one that
hath been ſeen in <hi>France.</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M</hi>— hath been very earneſt with me to go along with him,
but I have excuſed my ſelf pretending affairs of great conſequence,
which I made him believe I had to do here. The affairs of ſo great
conſequence is a ſiege: I have laid to a place that is very pleaſant,
and excellently well ſcituated. I have drawn my lines of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation
about it, after the way of <hi>Holland</hi> and yours, and <hi>Pico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini</hi>
ſhould not hinder me from taking it. Things being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
on ſo far it would have troubled me extreamly to raiſe the

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115945:92"/>

all men are fallen in love, all the Women become handſome, and

and what haply you will think incredible, is, that amidſt all theſe
entertainments, the day is extream burdenſome to me, and from
morning to night, I know not what either to ſay or do wih ſo
many loves. There's not one fallen to my ſhare, and of ſo many
Beauties, there's not any one I dare pretend to; So that while the
gallants that are here, are elevated with their Fortunes, and make
reſolutions to live here eternally, I heartily wiſh my ſelf at your fire

ſhould attribute this to the two <hi>Grains,</hi> ſhee gave me at parting, or
to ſomething elſe; but I never was guilty of ſuch paſſionate wiſhes

hope, that preventing your writing, and venturing my ſtock
voluntarily in that Trade, I ſhould have given you ſo ſignal an
expreſſion of my affection, as what I have received from you of
yours. But what you have written to me is ſo obliging, that I
muſt confeſs, I dare not pretend to any worthineſs to anſwer it,
and that the ſloathfulleſt perſon in the World being in my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
would do as much as I do. Certainly, Madam, thoſe who
will not allow you to have the tenderneſs you ought, muſt needs
acknowledge, that if you are not the moſt amorous perſon in the
World; yet are you the moſt obliging. True friendſhip hath not
more kindneſs then there is in your words; and all even ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of affection become you ſo well, that the moſt perfect
ſouls cannot but be ſatisfy'd therewith. Yet can I not but imagine
there is ſome charme in them for me, and though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in the adulterations of friendſhip the Secret that Monſieur — hath
for Rubies, and that when you pleaſe, you can give a little
paſte the luſtre of a precious ſtone; yet am I confident that what
you have made with me is very ſubſtantial, and that there is not any
thing more true, or more firm: For my part, I may ſafely ſay,
that I have ever honour'd and lov'd you beyond any other whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
but nothing comparably to what I do now; and I dare not
burthen this Letter with the ſentiments I have for you, leaſt, if it
miſ-carry, it ſhould be taken for a love-Letter. I do not think
that paſſion can pretend to greater ſenſibility and tenderneſs, then
what I daily feel in my ſelf for you. Yet I cannot perſonate the
agitations of extravagant Lovers, nor put out my tongue like
<hi>Iſcaron.</hi> But certain it is that ſince I left you, I am troubled
with ſuch fits of melancholly as almoſt diſtract me, inſomuch that
all the World wonders at it, nay in ſome hours of the day, Father
<hi>Tranquillus</hi> and the little <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> would make no difficulty to
exorciſe me, for if I have known any divertiſement, it hath been
to entertain all people with diſcourſe of you. It was diſcover'd that
I had been at your Houſe, and at <hi>Loudun,</hi> ſo that to ſee me prov'd
a general curioſity, and I was examin'd as one return'd from
Heaven or Hell. I told them, Madam, that you were as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
as you were four years ſince. But when I would have told
them that you were grown a greater wit, they thought I related
things incredible, and there I loſt all credit: And yet it cannot be
deny'd but miracles are done in you, which never were in any, for
the World never afforded any one that gain'd beauty by the ſmall
Pox, and was refin'd by a Country converſation. Mademoiſelle <hi>de
Rambouillet</hi> was extreamly pleas'd with your Letter, I took it for
one of the beſt you ever writ, and was not a little glad to ſee what
was ſo much to my advantage ſo excellently well written. What
aſſurance ſoever I had my ſelf of your affection; yet is it a pleaſure
to me to ſee your liberality of it towards others, and confeſſe that
effeminate vanity, you ſay <hi>I</hi> am guilty of, was mov'd at it. Adieu

                  <salute>My Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>ARe you not ſtill troubled that you ſuſpected not that thoſe of
<hi>Verceil</hi> wanted powder, or that, wanting it; they were not
able to make good the place, or that you have, with eight or
nine thouſand, forced twenty thouſand into very good Works?
certainly you make no great uſe of your reaſon, if that vexation
find you work ſtill; were you in hopes to do things impoſſible,
that you are not ſatisfy'd that you have done all that might be?
Your Lordſhip will pardon me if I tell you ſo much, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it ſuits not well with a grave perſon to be ſo diſordered for a
thing, wherein he hath not fail'd; and me thinks it takes away
much from the merit of a mans duty, when he is not ſatisfy'd that
he hath done it. You brought a handful of people to the relief of a
place beſieg'd by a numerous Army; you found the lines drawn
about it, and all the works in ſuch a poſture, as that it was
thought you could not have gotten a ſingle man into the City,
to give them any intelligence, and yet contrary to the hopes and
opinions of all the World, you have gotten in eighteen hundred.
Could any thing be done more reſolutely, better deſign'd, or more
fortunately executed? It was you that brought things to that paſſe,
Fortune hath done the reſt, and if ſhee hath done ill, why ſhould
you torment your ſelf ſo much? Accuſtome not your ſelf, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you to ſo much familiarity with her, but as well in good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
as in the contrary, diſtinguiſh between what ſhee hath done,
and what you have. Hence it will happen, that you will never
have any either too high or too low thoughts of your ſelf. If you
will needs be accountable for all events, and cannot be ſatisfied;
but when all, your own wiſhes can ſuggeſt, comes to paſſe, you muſt
certainly wage a War upon very hate conditions, and expect For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſhould do as much for you as ſhee did for <hi>Alexander,</hi> and
ſomewhat more then ſhee hath done for <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Beſides, you are
ungrateful to your own, if you quarrel with her about this laſt acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115945:94"/>
and it is a kind of injuſtice to think it a great mis-fortune to
have miſs'd a great proſperity. You, in the mean time, talk as
if, through your own owerſight, you had loſt ten Battels and a
hundred Cities, and you ſeem to be enraged at the loſſe of a place,
which in the opinion of all the World was given over from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
The taking of <hi>Verceil</hi> hath much prejudiced the Kings
affairs, but your reputation ſuffers not at all in it. If the relief
you have put into it, hath not proved effectual, it deſerves never
the leſſe praiſe, nay in the height of your proſperity, you never did
any thing more gallant, more reſolute, or more extraordinary.
Take then more moderate reſolutions, then thoſe you ſeem to
have, and being not in a capacity to frighten your Enemies, do
not your friends. You, who have taught me all I know, are not to
learn, that Prudence is a general vertue, which winds it ſelf into all
the reſt, and that where ſhee is not, Fortitude loſeth it's name
and nature.</p>
               <p>To morrow or the day after, I ſhall do your complements to the
perſon you tell me of; the laſt time I ſaw her, ſhee ſpoke extreamly
of you, and proteſted to me, that upon your account, ſhee took no
great joy for the taking of <hi>Verceil;</hi> for though all the World was
ſatisfy'd you were not in any fault, yet ſhee knew it troubled you,
and had a greater affection for you, then to entertain any joy for a
thing, whereat you were afflicted. No doubt but ſhee loves you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,
if I am not miſtaken, and there's another does it more
then infinitely,</p>

               <p>For the <hi>Edentulum</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi> I concur with you, that his

               <p>SEriouſly Sir, I was never ſo much diſordered as I am at the
preſent; in the mean time you write nothing but extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances,
and are as gameſome and free, as if we were ſtill in our
youthful Studies, and were not troubled at any thing in the world.
Inſtead of ſaying ſomething to me relating to my affliction, and
giving me your judgement of it, (for it requires as much matter
of conjecture as any the obſcureſt paſſage in <hi>Tacitus,</hi>) you quote
to me <hi>Lampridius,</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus, quàm ineptè,</hi> and at a time
when <hi>I</hi> am diſputing in my ſelf, whether I am in Madam — 's
favour or not, and that it is become a Probleme, you come and
entertain me with <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> When we return'd together from

                  <hi>Arcueil,</hi> if I had held you in diſcourſe with the Kings of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
conſider how well you would have taken it, and what attention
you would have given me. And yet <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs, I could not
but with much ſatisfaction read over all you writ. What you tell
me of — hath made me laugh.</p>

a third hand to rob him. I cannot expreſs the extraordinary ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction

               <p>For thoſe Gentlemen of <hi>Quintus Metellus Celer,</hi> I have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance

Others that he was too heavy; ſome, that the <hi>Argonants</hi> were

others, that it was by reaſon of his gluttony. I remember I have

<hi>Monſieur;</hi> I am to ſollicit <hi>Monſieur de Bulion</hi> for an Order; and
get my money out of the Excheaquer: I muſt bid all my friends
adieu, and for all this I have but three dayes. In the mean time
I lay all aſide to divert my ſelf by writing to you, for me thinks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
conſerns me ſo much, and that this voyage would not prove
very fortunate to me, if I began it ſo ominouſly as to be gone
hence without bidding you Farewel. I know not whether this

the Mediterranean, the two and thirty winds which you know I
ſometime defied upon the Ocean. But now it comes into my

needs love you well, that I can without envy read whatever you
write to me, and take ſo much pleaſure to find you more witty then
my ſelf. To be free with you, the greateſt affliction my departure
hence cauſes me, is that I ſhall hear no more from you; Me thinks
the Figgs, the Grapes, the Mellons of <hi>Italy,</hi> nay the Preſent the

               <p>I Cannot abſolutely ſay that I am come to <hi>Turin,</hi> for I have
brought but half my ſelf with me. You think my meaning is
that I have left the other with you, you are miſtaken, it is,
that of a hundred and four pound, that I weigh'd at my coming out
of <hi>Paris,</hi> I now weigh but fifty two. I am out of fleſh and falne
away extreamly, and this alteration conſidered, I think the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Piſany,</hi> and I ſhall not know one another at our next
meeting. The feaver ſtay'd me a day at <hi>Roan,</hi> I thought my
ſelf ſurely laid up, and expected a ſickneſs of ſome continuance.
What troubled me moſt, was, that I imagined you would hardly
believe it proceeded from the grief I took at my parting from you, &amp;
would attribute it to my riding Poſt. And indeed that was not
improbable, and what confirm'd this opinion, is, that queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
the three laſt Horſes I rid on, had hurt very much that part of
the body which you know <hi>Brunel</hi> ſhew'd <hi>Marphiſa;</hi> and what was
more dangerous, I had ſuch an exceſſive heat, that if I had been
Governour of Monſieur <hi>le Dauphin,</hi> I could not have been fitter
for it, then I was the four firſt dayes. I mentioned it to a great
Perſon in <hi>Roan,</hi> who being as I was told Apothecary, brought
me ſomething that gave me much eaſe. I pray let my Lady
Dutcheſs know as much, ſince that I have not had any hurt, ſave
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115945:97"/>
that of not ſeeing you; but for that there is no remedy, Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Salt cannot cure it. I am here ever ſince yeſterday in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
I have not ſeen my Lady Dutcheſs yet, by reaſon that yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the Duke was thought to lye dying, to day <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſee her: to
morrow I ſhall go hence for the Army, and I hope the next day
about noon, I ſhall ſee my Lord Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and your
Brother. I doubt not, Madam, but you will be glad of this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and will not take it ill I ſhould be ſenſible of this joy in your
abſence. When I ſay in your abſence, I include alſo that of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>la Princeſſe,</hi> Mademoiſelle <hi>de Bourbon,</hi> my Lady Dutcheſs of

and my Lady Marchioneſs your Mother, whom I ſhould have

You cannot believe how much I am troubled at the ſickneſs
of Mademoiſelle <hi>de Liancourt;</hi> if ſhee be any thing recovered, and
cured of her — be pleas'd, Madam, to let me know ſo much at
<hi>Rome;</hi> for that will oblige me to take a journey thither, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall

               <p>I Wiſh you had ſeen what condition I was in this day in a Glaſs;
you had found me among the moſt horrid Mountains in the
World, in the midſt of a dozen or fifteen men, the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to look on that might be, whereof the moſt innocent had kill'd
fifteen or twenty others. They were all black as Devils, their hair
grown down to the midſt of their bodies, every one had two or three
cuts over the face, an arquebuſe on his ſhoulder, and two Piſtols
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115945:98"/>
and two Daggers at his Girdle. Theſe are the <hi>Bandits</hi> that live in
the Mountains of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Genua,</hi> you would certainly
have been afraid Madam, to ſee me among thoſe Gentlemen, and
would have thought they had been going to cut my Throat. For
fear of robbing I had entreated their Company, having written to
their Captain the night before, to come and expect me in my
way, which he hath done, ſo that I have got off for three Piſtols.
But above all, I wiſh you had ſeen what faces my Nephew and my
man put on it, who thought no leſſe then that I had led them to
the Shambles. Having diſmiſſed them, I came into two places
where there were Spaniſh Garriſons, and there certainly I was in
greater hazard then before: being examin'd, I ſaid I was a <hi>Savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi>
and to paſſe for ſuch, <hi>I</hi> ſpoke as near as I could like M. <hi>de</hi> — upon
my bad accent I was permitted to paſſe. Conſider
whether I ſhall ever make any excellent diſcourſes that will ſtand me
in ſo much ſteed, and if it had not been very impertinent at that
time, that, under pretence of my being of the Academy, I ſhould
have pump'd my ſelf for the beſt French. Thence I came to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vone</hi>
where I found the Sea ſomewhat more rough then was ſuitable
to the ſmall veſſel I had taken, and yet, God be prais'd I am come
ſafely hither. Conſider Madam, what a many haza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ds; I have
run through in one day. In a word, I have eſcaped the <hi>Bandits,</hi>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Sea, all which have not done me ſo much
hurt, as you do, and it is for your ſake that I run the greateſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
I am like to meet with in this voyage. You think I do but
jeaſt; but, may I dy, if <hi>I</hi> can any longer ſtave off the affliction, it is
to me not to ſee your Mother and your ſelf. I muſt indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that at the firſt I was in ſome doubt whether it were you or the
Poſt Horſes that hurt me; but now it is ſix dayes ſince I have rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and yet feel no leſſe wearineſs. This convinces me that my
torment proceeds from my diſtance from you, and that my greateſt
wearineſs is that of not ſeeing you; and this is ſo certain, that if I
had no other buſineſs here, than what I have to do at <hi>Florence,</hi> I
think I ſhould immediately return hence, and not have the courage
to go any further, had I not an affair of yours to ſollicit at <hi>Rome.</hi>
Be then pleas'd to think your ſelf obliged to me for this; for I aſſure

cauſtd me to hold that correſpondence, ſince that even now,

not know the reaſon of it, that is, that who hath been accuſtom'd
to ſee you, cannot well enjoy himſelf when he does not. To deal
truely with you, Madam, I have the ſame conſideration of you as of

though, when you are preſent, I obſerve not that moderation
which might gain me a good conſtitution with you, yet as ſoon as
you are once gone, I make a thouſand wiſhes for you. <hi>I</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the World affords not any thing more precious, and find by
experience that all the delicacies of the Earth are bitter and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
without you. I took more pleaſure to ſee with you two or

that you may know I am not in jeſt, but in very good earneſt, as

received me in his arms, and the next day in the evening I ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in my Lady <hi>d'Estree's</hi> Chamber. The Doctors tell me they
are melancholly vapours, and that theſe accidents are not to be
ſlighted. For my part, ſeeing they took me two dayes together,
and that I was in danger of ſomething worſe, I have neither play'd
the Fool nor Mad-man, have taken the <hi>Antimony,</hi> which I had from

                  </gap>r my Lord, there's nothing ſo certain, as that I
never ſee you but I am better for ſome dayes, and never come near
you, but I feel my good Angel reſuming new Forces, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of me with more aſſurance. It is long ſince <hi>I</hi> am convinced
in my thoughts, that if God hath decreed my converſion, he will
make uſe of no other means then that of your diſcourſes, and your
example; and that if he ſhould ſend a voyce from Heaven to call
me home again, it ſhall come through your mouth. Hence it is,
that me thinks the will I have to ſerve you, in ſome ſort, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
me, and that I cannot be abſolutely profane, when I have ſo
much reſpect and affection for ſo reverend a perſon. I muſt at leaſt
attribute it to you, that I am guilty of one rational paſſion among
ſo many that are not ſuch, and that I am not ſo abſolutely irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
but there is one part of my Soul untainted. Though I do
not find it the beſt employments I might, and am a very ill Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
thereof; yet I doubt not, but I have ſecured for ever the part
you have in it, nor can I ever forfeit or engage the place you have
therein. It is great enough, my Lord, to ſave one day, all the reſt,
and I deſpair not but ſhortly it will be wholly your own. You
daily purchaſe ſomething in it, and want not much of having an
intereſt there greater then that of all the World beſides. Be pleas'd
to make all your own, and be as proud of the acqueſt, as if it were
that of ſome unbelieving Country, whereof you had been deſign'd
to deſtroy the Idols. I am in ſome hopes it will ſo come to paſſe,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115945:100"/>
and reflecting on the great favours you have done, and confident,
that you cannot be miſtaken, I look on all the good you have ſaid
of me as a Prophecy, and believe I ſhall be ſuch hereafter, as you
aſſur'd Cardinal <hi>Barbelin</hi> I was then. I cannot well expreſſe the
noble entertainment he made me upon your recommendation, and
the affection he ſeems to have for whatever you concern your ſelf in.
You are, my Lord, almoſt as well known in <hi>Italy</hi> as in <hi>France,</hi> and
certainly, I have not met with any thing at <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby I have
been ſo much edified, as the eſteem and paſſion I found there for
you. But above all, Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> ſeems to be your abſolute
friend, and to have for your vertue that affection and reſpect, which
you ſhed into the hearts of all thoſe who follow your example. He
hath burthen'd me with ſome thing particular to you from him,
which I reſerve till I have the honour to ſee you, and be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

not hazard your ſelf more freely then you have done, as having
carry'd Valour to it's uttermoſt limits, and to the higheſt point,

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115945:102"/>
trouble to me, to loſe thereby an opportunity to expreſs the real

whom I acquainted with my deſign, told me, that the ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

Mademoiſelle <hi>de la Trimouille,</hi> in caſe I ſhould have come to the
Wheel in <hi>Italy,</hi> I thought it no great matter to be hanged there.
But it had been a pleaſant ſpectacle, if the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi>
walking on the Walls ſhould have known me upon the Ladder.
The troth on't is, wanting your preſence, a man would not ſtick
to hang himſelf for a half penny, and feeling a great weight on his
ſtomack, it were better be ſtrangled then endure it. You, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,

to come to himſelf again, and to apprehend things, he ſighes out,
whence come you? O ſighes here, and ſighes there; come, come,
take your money, 'tis the ſaddeſt thing in the World.</hi> Fear not

could I reſolve that Queſtion though I ſhould ſtudy it till to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow.
The authority you have over me is ſo equally divided
between you both, that, if at the ſame time one ſhould command
me to eat, the other to drink, I ſhould be ſtarv'd, at leaſt according
to the Philoſophers, for, I ſhould never find any reaſon to comply,
with the one rather then with the other. But, as good Fortune
will have it, you agree ſo well together, that you will never lay
contrary commands upon me, and joyn intereſts, ſo that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I ſhall do what I am commanded, I ſhall ſatisfy both. I am

               <p>THE Letter you ſo much deſire to ſee is not worth one line of
that wherewith you demand it. But are you, who pretended
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115945:104"/>
to ſo much devotion yeſterday, nothing troubled in mind at the
writing of ſuch things in the <hi>Paſſion</hi>-week, and do you not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the conſequences and effects they may produce? I had clear'd
and disburthen'd my conſcience, and had thereupon reſolv'd not to
ſee you again; but your Letter hath put me into my former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
and with your Pearls and your four thouſand Livers, I am
corrupted as well as the other. I never thought, you ſhould ever
have been put to theſe ſhifts to reduce a Servant, nor that ſuch
things ſhould prevail any thing with me, and to tell you truely, it
is the firſt time I ever was dazled with wealth, or tempted with
mony. And indeed, it muſt be confeſſed, the Pearls never had ſuch
a luſtre as you have given them in your Letter, and your four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Livers, as you employ them, may well be valew'd at above
three hundred thouſand. You are certainly an incomprehenſible
perſon, and I cannot but wonder, how without the reading of
<hi>Herodotus,</hi> or making uſe of the <hi>Saturnales,</hi> you have been able
to write ſuch excellent Letters. For my part, Madam, I begin to
imagine you have deceiv'd us; I doubt not but you know the
ſource of the <hi>Nile;</hi> for that, whence you derive all the things you
ſay, is much harder to find and more unknown. In a word, what
ever your Porter may ſay, my Lady Marchioneſs <hi>de Sable,</hi> is not
the moſt accompliſh'd perſon in the World; there are more charms
in a corner of your eye; then in all the Earth beſides, and all the

               <p>NO doubt but ſome one of the Fairies to whom you ſay, you
recommend your Letters after they are written, hath laid hands
on that you have ſent me. It muſt certainly needshave
been one of the moſt knowing among them, and one that is as well
acquainted with the <hi>Court</hi> as the <hi>Winds.</hi> I do not believe the
Kingdome of them can afford many, able to do as much; and am
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115945:104"/>
of opinion that the ſame who inſpires you when you ſpeak, hath
for this time aſſiſted you to write. Beſides the Gentilleſſes I have
obſerv'd, and the viſible beauties that ſhine in it, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, that ſmites the heart as well as the Phant'ſy, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſecret vertue, that produces extraordinary effects. I had no
ſooner read it over, ere I found myſelf free'd from all my smis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and as if all abſence, all deſires, all fears, had been baniſh'd
this World, my Soul was immediately in an abſolute calme. This,
Madam, I cannot believe poſſible to be done; but by the ſcience of
Fairyſhips, for to love you as I do, and to be ſatisfy'd without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, cannot certainly be a natural effect. However it be, I
am oblig'd to you for having put me into the condition I am in,
and ſince I was not to expect any ſatisfaction from Reaſon, you
have done well to apply charmes. All my fear is, they will not laſt
long, I diſtruſt the joy I feel, when I am ignorant of the cauſe of it;
and am afraid the ſame fate may happen to me, as to dead bodies
forc'd out of their graves, which having only a Magical animation
are actuated but for a while, and fall down ſuddenly, when the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
is once diſſolv'd. Suffer not my caſe to be the ſame;
and ſince I am re-animated by your words, and that your Letters
are certain Characters, which while I have about me, I cannot dye,
be it your care to renew them daily, and let me have at leaſt an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
ſubſiſtence, till I ſee you again, and that your preſence inſpire
me with real life. The relation you have given me of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
is, I muſt needs acknowledge, very pleaſant, ſince it gives
me occaſion to derive a certain pleaſure from the very inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences

Madam, I am reſolved not to entertain any if you come not, and
muſt expect to be the happieſt or the unhappieſt man in the World
according to the reſolution you ſhall take. I dare alſo tell you that
you ſhall not want your part of the ſatisfaction we intend you, and
that infallibly you will find greater diverſion and mirth here, and
conſequently more health. But till you do come, it would be an
extraordinary kindneſs, would you but ſend Mademoiſelle — and

               <p>T'is very confidently done, to daſh out four lines together when

               <p>THough I am utterly out of all hope of acquitting my ſelf of
thoſe obligations, which your civilities have forced upon me,
yet ſhould I be troubled they were any leſſe; and though I
think my ſelf unworthy all the honours you ſhed on me, yet can I
not but derive thence an extraordinary ſatisfaction. Had I no
other acquaintance with you then that I knew your conditions and
quality, I ought to look on the honour of your Letters and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
as the greateſt I am capable of. But it having been the
pleaſure of Fortune, I know not by what contrivances, that, being
at a great diſtance from you; I ſhould know you as particularly as
thoſe who are about you, I muſt confeſs, Madam, it is a ſatisfaction
beyond all expreſſion, and that I feel my ſelf troubled with a little
vanity, that I ſhould receive ſo great favours from a perſon, who I
have long ſince thought the moſt accompliſhed of the age, and in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115945:106"/>
whom I know may be found all the perfections that command
affection and eſteem. Were I ſo inconſiderable in the World as
never to have heard any thing of this; yet were it eaſy for me to
judge by your Letters, that France affords not any thing compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to your wit and civility; nay expreſſions ſo tranſcendent and ſo
full of obligation as thoſe you have given me, would almoſt make
me imagine there were ſomething in it extraordinary. I cannot,
Madam, but acknowledge them ſuch, that from whomſoever they
came, I ſhould have been extreamly ſurpriz'd thereat; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the perſon, from whom they are ſent, renders them yet much
more conſiderable, and the hand that writ them, inſpires them
with a force and vertue, which they could not derive elſewhere. If
after this my heartieſt ſervices — attend <hi>A</hi>— it will
be no great miracle, you have obliged me thereto ſo much, that it
is impoſſible I ſhould do otherwiſe, ſince you have not left me the
leaſt pretence or ſhadow of merit. I wiſh, Madam, that inſtead of
recommending to me a perſon, for whom I had already a great
eſteem and affection, you had in three words commanded me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that were difficult, and whereto I ſhould have had ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy,
that ſo you might, in ſome degree, have diſcover'd how
far I am at your devotion; and that it is not your extraordinary
kindneſſes, nor yet that manner of writing whereby you gain the

nor do I much fear to tell it you plainly, becauſe I believe you
will not be much troubled at it. Nevertheleſs, if you will have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115945:106"/>
the naked truth, when there's no danger to tell it you, I was, you
know, a very jocund Bachelor, and unleſs it were, that I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
given to conteſtation, and was as obſtinate as your ſelf, my
other imperfections were excuſable. You are then to underſtand,
Madam, that ſince laſt Wedneſday which was the day of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
I have neither eaten nor opened either my mouth or my
eyes, and indeed all that is wanting is that I am ſtill above
ground, that is unburied. I would needs have that laſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
delay'd a while, for theſe reaſons; in the firſt place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have ever had an averſion thereto, and next, I ſhould
not take it well the report of my death ſhould be ſpread abroad
ſo ſoon, and therefore I put the beſt face I can on it, that men
might ſtill be in doubt; for if they conſider that, it happen'd
to me juſt in the nick of your departure, we ſhall never avoid
coming into the ballad called <hi>The good year,</hi> which is now ſo much
in vogue. Were I again in the World, one of the things I
ſhould be extreamly troubled at, is, the little diſcretion that many
have in advancing and abetting all manner of Stories. Theſe
that are a live, are not in my opinion, impertinent in any thing ſo
much as this, nay it is hateful even to us that are dead. But,
Madam, take heed you do not laugh when you read this, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
it is a kind of impiety to abuſe the dead, and were you in
my condition, you would not take it well to be ſo dealt with.
I therefore conjure you to pity me; and ſince you cannot do any
thing elſe for me; have a care of my Soul, for I aſſure you, it is
in extraordinary Torments. When we were ſeparated, ſhee took
immediately the road to <hi>Chartres,</hi> and thence ſtraight to <hi>la
Mothe,</hi> and now while you read this Letter ſhee is at your Elbow,
and will be this night in your Chamber, and if you think it not
importunate, give you five or ſix outcries. I believe you would
be much pleas'd with the noiſe, for it is not unlike that of the
Angels of the Lower-houſe; while ſhee torments herſelf,
and makes ſuch a helliſh Stir, that you will think the Houſe
ready to turn upſide down. I was once in a mind to ſend you the
Body by the Carrier, as alſo that of the Marſhal <hi>de Fervaque's</hi>
Lady, but it is in ſuch a pitiful condition, that it would have been
all to pieces ere it had been with you; beſides that I was afraid the
heat might have ſpoil'd it. You will honour me extreamly, if you
pleaſe to tell the two excellent Princeſſes with whom you are, &amp; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
them to call to mind, that while I liv'd, I was their incomparably

               <p>YOu had perſwaded me, that ere I ſhould have continu'd here
quite three weeks, I ſhould ſpend my time very pleaſantly,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115945:109"/>
and it is now above ſix ſince I came hither, and ſee not any effect
of your prediction. I humbly beſeech you, make good your word,
by affording me the ſatisfaction you promis'd, which you muſt ſend
me from the place where you are, ſince I cannot meet with any
here. I have done you that ſervice at my coming hither, that you
are oblig'd not to deny me this aſſiſtance, for you are to know that
I have given you a reſurrection in the opinion of all the World,
and that you have not any friends or kindred here, who thought
you not dead ever ſince Autumne laſt. If your Lordſhip doth
think this ſervice of any conſequence, and deſerves acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it will be your fault if you do not as much for me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
me to life, which I cannot abſolutely ſay, I have in this place.
To do this miracle there needs no more then a Letter from you,
with an aſſurance that you continue me the honour of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If what you expreſſed to me at my departure be not quite loſt,
you will not deny me this favour, eſpecially having in your neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſo excellent a Secretary as him you are wont to make uſe of. I
have underſtood you did me the honour to drink my health; but as
it is now, there are requiſite ſtronger remedies then that to reſtore
it, and it is only from you that I can expect any. But from the
reflection I make on the love, you have for whatever belongs to
you, and the protection I have ſometimes ſeen you afford your
ſubjects, I raiſe a confidence that you will not forſake me, who am
as much your vaſſal as if I had been born in your Town of <hi>Eſſars,</hi>

               <p>IT muſt needs be acknowledg'd that I am remarkable for the
ſincerity of my friendſhip; 'tis a grief to me that I ſee you not,
as if it were a loſs of great conſequence to me, and me thinks, I
ſpend not my time ſo well here, as when I have the honour to be near
you. <hi>Amiens,</hi> in your abſence, ſeems leſſe pleaſant to me then <hi>Paris,</hi>

                  <hi>Picardy</hi> excellently well, yet I do not think my ſelf ever the happier
for it. The converſation of my Lord Duke <hi>de C</hi>— Monſieur
<hi>de T</hi>— and Monſieur <hi>de</hi>— whom I meet here often, affords
me no entertainment at all. Sometimes I think it very tedious to
continue three hours together in the Kings Chamber, nay I find no
diverſion in the Society of Monſieur <hi>Libero,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Compiegne,</hi>
and twenty more excellent perſons, I have no acquaintance with,
who very much celebrate my parts, and tell me they have ſeen of my
works. I have ſeen the King play at <hi>Hoc</hi> all this afternoon, and yet
find not the leaſt remiſſion of my Spirits; and though I go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
thrice a week a Fox-hunting, I find no great ſport in it,
though there be in the company a hundred Dogs, &amp; as many Horns,
which together make a hideous noiſe, ſuch as whereof the terrour
would break your tender Ears. To be ſhort, Madam, the Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the greateſt Prince in the World divert me not, and when I
want your ſight, I am inſenſible even of the enjoyments of the
Court. You are, certainly, very ungrateful, if you render me not

you may recompence it with this favour, that you will be pleas'd to

               <p>AFter ſo many conſolatory Letters as there hath been, but too

Theſe come to you ſo ſeldome, that I think they muſt
needs be very welcome when they do; and were there nothing elſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115945:110"/>
to recomend them, certainly the novelty ſhould make them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.
It is long ſince, Madam, that I have expected what now
begins to appear, and thought, the mis-fortune of the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
and moſt amiable Princeſs that ever was, too great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
in the World to laſt long. How great ſoever the Malice and
envy of Fortune ſeemed to be towards you, and what fate ſoever
might croſſe your affairs, yet was I ſtill guilty of an imagination
that ſo much goodneſs, generoſity and conſtancy, and ſo many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
qualities as your <hi>R. H.</hi> is furniſh'd with, could not be long
unfortunate, and that, at length, Heaven would be forc'd to do
ſome miracle for a perſon on whom it had beſtow'd ſo many.
There is much reaſon to believe, Madam, that that of the taking
of <hi>Turin</hi> will be ſeconded by a many others, and that the great
ſucceſs which hath happen'd in your Dominions is a certain Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Symptome that there will be a change of all things, and ſuch a
general ſettlement as naturally ought to be. But what you ſhould
the more rejoyce at in this happy revolution, is, that, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo certain as that your concernment therein, multiplies the
joy of all here, and that your <hi>R. H.</hi> is ſo well beloved, that the

you have in this proſperity, as for the advantage accrews to the

               <p>I Am ſo well acquainted with your Eloquence, that I humbly
beg your aſſiſtance to render the acknowledgements, I ought,
to the moſt excellent and moſt generous Princeſs in the World.
I am certainly even orewhelm'd with her favours, and muſt confeſs,
there's not any thing below Heaven ſo full of charme or ſo amiable
as the Miſtreſs <hi>you,</hi> (I thought to have ſaid <hi>we</hi>) ſerve, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there is not any thing I would not contemne, that I might uſe
that expreſſion. The firſt time I ever heard her, I was preſently
of opinion, that of all the underſtandings in the World, there was
not a greater then hers; but the tenderneſs ſhee is pleas'd to have
for me, I am aſtoniſhed at above all things; and cannot ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
admire, that at the ſame time, when ſhee is burthened with
higheſt thoughts, ſhee can alſo entertain thoſe that are ſo low, and
that a mind which ordinarily is ſoaring about the loftieſt things,
can be guilty of ſo great condeſcenſions. As to the balls, have been
given me this morning, they have wrought a wonderful effect in
me; and were it not that they had touch'd the hand of her Royal
Highneſs, I ſee not whence the miracle ſhould proceed. I did but
kiſſe the Paper wherein they were, and I find my ſelf very much
better, I ſhall henceforth look on it as an antidote againſt all kinds
of mis-fortunes, and unleſs it be one, I know not any which ſo
pleaſant a remedy cannot cure me of. That you may not put your
ſelf to too nice a ſcrutiny to find out my meaning, I were better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
it, and tell you, that it is the grief I take that I cannot ſee
her enough, and am deſtin'd to live at a great diſtance from the
only perſon that deſerves to be waited on. If you conſider it ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this mis-fortune is greater then all the reſt, and it is very hard
for a man to be tender of his honour, and not to take it ſo much to
heart, as to dye of it.</p>

               <p>THough it muſt be thought an ordinary thing to ſee you do
glorious actions, and that it is fifteen years that you have been
talk'd of at this rate, yet can I not avoid being extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
when I hear of any new performances of your Valour, and
your Reputation being ſo precious to me, as it is, I am extreamly
pleas'd that from time to time it is renew'd and multiply'd daily.
Thoſe who are guilty of the greateſt ambitions of honour would be
ſatisfy'd, with what you have acquir'd within theſe late years, and
would ſit ſtill with the eſteem you are in with all the World. But,
for ought I can ſee, My Lord, you ſet no limits to your ſelf as to
this point, and as if you were jealous of the glory you have already
acquir'd, and what you have done heretofore, you ſeem every year
to exceed your ſelf, and to do ſomething beyond your former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements.
For my part, what paſſion ſoever I may have for
your paſt actions, I ſhall not beſorry they ſhould be Eclips'd by
thoſe you are yet to effect, and that your exploits in <hi>Flanders</hi>
ſhould darken all you have perform'd in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and
<hi>Italy.</hi> All my fear is, that theſe great aſpirations at Glory,
ſhould carry you beyond your due bounds as to matter of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
and accordingly, what you did in the laſt Battel wherein
the Marſhal <hi>de la Meilleray</hi> defeated the Enemy, as it affords me
much cauſe of rejoycing, ſo does it at the ſame time put me into
ſome fear. The expreſſions you there made of your conduct, and
your courage find matter if general admiration here; and indeed,
my Lord, if we conſult <hi>Romances,</hi> we ſhall hardly find any
thing more noble, or more worthy celebration. But yet, give
me leave to tell you, that, ſince the invention of inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Armes is loſt; and the cuſtome, that <hi>Hero's</hi> ſhould
be invulnerable abſolutely aboliſh'd, a man is not allowed
to do ſuch actions as theſe often in his life; and Fortune, who
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115945:112"/>
hath deliver'd you for this time, is but bad ſecurity for the future.
Be pleas'd therefore to conſider that <hi>Fortitude</hi> hath it's extreams as
well as all the other Vertues, and that, as they are, ſo it alſo ought
to admit the attendance of <hi>Prudence.</hi> This, if ſeriouſly conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

me to loſe the beſt, and moſt valuable of my friends, puts me into
ſo much the greater apprehenſion for you. To allay this, all I have,
is a ſecret confidence in your good Fortune; my heart tells me that
you have a great journey yet to go, and a many things to do, and

your Letters. They are, no queſtion, pleaſant beyond all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination:

raviſh'd with them, and accordingly have an extraordinary eſteem
and abundance of reſpects for pou. Be it therefore your care to
preſerve them by writing to me as often, and as pleaſantly as you
can: this you will find no hard task, the place where you are,
will furniſh yon with new things, though it were for theſe ten
years. I wiſh it were ſo eaſie for me to entertain you, and that
by deſcribing our Garments, Actions, manner of life, our food,
the faſhions and Beauties of our women; I could write ſuch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

of our Religion; I believe you have not forgot any thing
that's done here: ſo that all I have further to ſay to you, is, that
I honour you perfectly, and love you heartily; and that you
know it as well as my ſelf. For, if I ſhould relate to you after what
manner we relieved <hi>Caſal,</hi> and how we took <hi>Arras</hi> and <hi>Turin;</hi>
What entertainment could it find you who are accuſtomed to your

               <p>AFter the finiſhing of one great ſiege and two ſmall ones, and
an aboad of fifteen dayes in <hi>Flanders</hi> without Equipage, do
you not think it an extraordinary refreſhment to go and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege
<hi>Bapaume,</hi> and to begin a freſh in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> as
if nothing had been done all the year before? Me thinks the
Knights heretofore had a much eaſier time of it, then thoſe that
live in theſe dayes, for as to thoſe the breaking of four or five Lances
in a week, and now and then a bruſh of fighting, or haply a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
was the main of their work. All the time beſides they took
their progreſſes in fair Forreſts and Flowery Meadows, &amp; moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

Lord, is certainly the greateſt Cheat in the World! Many times,

of the hazard of Iron and Lead, (a thing not worth the
ſpeaking of,) but ſuppoſing you alwayes fought under inchanted
Armes, yet can you not avoid it; but the War muſt cut of the beſt
part of your beſt dayes: it hath robbed you of ſix Months of this
year, nay from you, whom it hath been pleas'd to perſerve a live,
it hath taken away within theſe fifteen years, above the one half of
your life. And yet, my Lord, it muſt be acknowledg'd, that thoſe

great enjoyments in it, and doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>OF all that I ſaid to you prejudicial to War, I now make my
recantation, and ſince the honour you have received is deriv'd
from it, all controverſy between me and it, is abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.
I have indeed long ſince been of opinion that ſo great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and Services, in a man of your quality, and a perſon ſo much
in the reſpects of all the World, could not but meet with ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and acknowledgemets. But there being a vaſt difference
between the things that are to be, and the things that effectually
are, I could not but be extreamly glad to hear that, that had been
done for you which needs muſt; and this news I was as ſenſible of,
and as much ſurpris'd at, as if I had not expected it. It is out of all
Queſtion, my Lord, that the principal recompence of your actions
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115945:115"/>
is the reputation they have gain'd you; but yet, it ſhould be no
ſlender ſatisfaction to you, to aſcend at your age, to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that the Fortune of War can raiſe men to. But, if on the other
ſide, you conſider how many dangers you have run through to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to this, what hazards you have been put to, and how many
gallant men you ſaw fall, who yet run the ſame race with you; you
will think your ſelf ſomewhat obliged to Fortune that hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
you thus long, and hath not oppoſed your vertue. Among
the many reaſons I have to congratulate your happineſs, there is
one particular ſatisfaction which you cannot have your ſelf, and
which truely, at leaſt in my opinion, ſurpaſſes all the reſt; to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
by the unforc'd and unſuſpected judgements of all the World,
that your glory is free from all envy, and to ſee, there is not any
one who is not as glad of your proſperity as if he were concern'd in
it. The publick rejoycing at this particular good Fortune of
yours, is to me a preſage that it will be ſeconded by a many more,
which it may produce; and I hope you will ſhortly add, to the
honour you have received from the King, that reputation, which

of the wiſeſt to go and build in a place, where I have already a fair
houſe ready built. I have be thought my ſelf, that that paſſage,
<hi>Nulli poteſt facilius eſſe loqui, quàm rerum naturae pingere,</hi> &amp;c.
Was the younger <hi>Pliny's,</hi> and thought it very pleaſant that
you durſt not name him to me. But in your judgement, is it
not better ſaid, <hi>Nulli poteſt facilius eſſe loqui, quàm rerum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae
facere?</hi> For, in the firſt place there's more oppoſition between
<hi>loqui</hi> and <hi>facere,</hi> then between <hi>loqui</hi> and <hi>pingere,</hi> which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of more grace. In the next, it is an expreſſion of greater

<hi>It is not ſo eaſy for any one to ſay as for Nature to paint.</hi> Will you
not acknowledge this to be ſomething flat and of a low Spirit, to
refuſe a word which preſents it ſelf, and is withal the better, and
to keep a great Stir to find out another that's not ſo good, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the ſence? He is one of thoſe eloquent blades, of whom
<hi>Quintilian</hi> ſays, <hi>Illis ſordent omnia quae narturae dictavit.</hi> And

have been very much refin'd with his <hi>pingere,</hi> and hath ſpoild all.
While I write this I conſider with my ſelf, how finely I were ſurpriz'd
if this paſſage belong to the elder <hi>Pliny.</hi> But if it be, his be the
loſſe, I will not retract what I have ſaid, why does he ſpeak like his
Nephew? <hi>Non ſapit patruum</hi> in that paſſage, even he, who in

hardly imagine thoſe Verſes ſhould be the work of any moderne

whoſe they are <hi>dirmi amine, mea Roſa, mea voluptas.</hi> With
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115945:117"/>
your Roſes, you have alſo ſent thorns, when you propoſe to me the
two paſſages, you would have me explicate. In the firſt place, as
to that of <hi>ſaluſt,</hi> we are to conſider that <hi>Hunting,</hi> was a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
exerciſe among the <hi>Scythians,</hi> the <hi>Numidians,</hi> nay the
<hi>Grecians</hi> themſelves, and particularly the <hi>Loc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>demonians;</hi> but
I do not remember I have ſeen any thing to prove that among the
<hi>Romans,</hi> it was the exerciſe of the more vertuous or better ſort.
For, <hi>Agriculture,</hi> it is to be diſtinguiſh'd according to <hi>Time.</hi>
In old <hi>Rome, conſular</hi> men, and ſuch as had been <hi>Dictators,</hi>
return'd from the management of the Common-wealth to the
Plough-tail, which was the ordinary employment or calling of the
<hi>Papirij,</hi> the <hi>Manlij</hi> and the <hi>Decij.</hi> But they had no ſooner taſted
the delciacies of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> ere they gave it over; and
you may eaſily judge that a ſort of people, who had the hair
drawn off their Arms and thighs with certain Pincers, who
cured and perfumed themſelves, were far enough from goading
of Oxen. If I am not miſtaken, it is in the lives of the
<hi>Gracchi</hi> that I have read, that one of the reaſons which mov'd
one of them to advance and <hi>Legem agrariam,</hi> was, that having
travell'd through <hi>Italy,</hi> he had not met with any at work in
the Fields about Husbandry, but only Slaves, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were all Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now, if it was
ſo then, it may be eaſily judged that in <hi>ſaluſt's</hi> time, it
was yet more ordinary to ſee Slaves employed in Tillage;
Whence it comes, that Hunting and Agriculture, which
are <hi>Quaeſtuoſae Artes,</hi> are by him called <hi>Servilia Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
quae aut à ſervis exercebantur, aut exer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cri pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the other, I think, that where <hi>Auſonius</hi> ſays, <hi>argue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
rectius</hi> Seneca <hi>quàm praedicabitur, non erudijſſe indolem</hi>
Neronis, <hi>ſed armâſſe ſaevitiam;</hi> he does not mean that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
had ever incited <hi>Nero</hi> to be cruel; but that inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
him for having taught his Diſciple Philoſophy enough,
to make him merciful, he is to be reprov'd for having taught
him too muſt ſublety and Rhetorick to maintain his cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
ſo that <hi>armare,</hi> in that place, is not underſtood of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
but defenſive Arms. And accordingly, I think <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
ſayes, that when that vertuous man had killed his
own Mother ('twas a terrible <hi>Storke) Seneca</hi> aſſiſted him to
write to the Senate upon that occaſion, and to find out pretences
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115945:118"/>
to palliate the horrid action whom he had committed. This paſſage
oblig'd me to read over the whole Oration of <hi>Auſonius,</hi> which had
I not done, I ſhould not have preſum'd to medle with it, and while
I have all the beſt Authors by heart, I would not willingly read a
line of the others. Good God! what jargon they ſpeak; after
what rate they write; and how is a man that is accuſtom'd to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi>
aſtoniſh'd when he finds himſelf among ſuch people!</p>
               <p>Of all the Letters I have received from you, I have not thought
any better writ or more pleaſant then the laſt; but the paſſage I am
moſt pleas'd with, is, that where you ſpeak of the Abbot of <hi>Lauar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>
There commendations, which he deſires you to preſent me
with from him, ſatisfy me, that, either he is extreamly civil, or
ſufficiently well opinion'd of me, and whether of the two it be, it
matters not, I am infinitely pleas'd at it, either for his intereſt or
my own. Sir, let me beg your favour ſo far as to let him know
from me, that I receive the honour he does me, withal the reſpects
and acknowledgements, which a perſon of his merit and quality
may juſtly claim; but withal, that I cannot ſit down with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of Civilities, that I aime at ſomething more, and have
a great deſign to gain one day the happineſs of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>I was not ſo much amaz'd to hear the Nunnes of <hi>Loudun</hi> ſpeak
<hi>Latin,</hi> as I was to ſee you rip ſo much <hi>Italian.</hi> A man cannot
diſcover by your citations, but that you underſtand it. But I
hope I ſhall be reveng'd when I hear you pronounce it; for, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
the Italian learn'd in <hi>Poiton</hi> hath not the accent extreamly
Romane, and therefore do what you can, <hi>ſapiet Poitavini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</hi>

               <p>Your, <hi>quod mirere,</hi> in the paſſage of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> ſpeaking of the
recreation of the <hi>Germans,</hi> is well obſerv'd and well underſtood.

               <p>YOu now ſee what it is to entertain your friends at great Feaſts,
there needs no other reaſon you ſhould not expect any returns
of them. And to put me to greater troubles, you bring
along with you Monſieur <hi>de Balzac,</hi> the moſt delicate, and the
moſt humorous perſon in the world, <hi>quâ munditiâ, quâ elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ
hominem?</hi> Your Diet I knew, and you were ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with my Table; but it cannot entertain ſo great a
ſtranger.</p>

                  <l>—Ingentem non ſuſtinet umbram.</l>
               </q>
               <p>To ſpeak freely, when I look on you both, I cannot but think
on <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> when they came to embrace poor <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
(be this however ſpoken without any offence to either, for
all compariſons are odious) and in effect, that good man had not
more reaſon to be troubled then I have. It is certainly a cruelty
in you to have engaged me to this, and that a more then <hi>Neroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
cruelty, <hi>Indicebat familiaribus coenas, quorum uni mellita
quadragies</hi> H. S. <hi>conſtiterunt, alteri pluris aliquanto roſaria.</hi>
To tell you the truth, that is it hath diverted me all this while;
I have often ſaid to my ſelf,
<q>
                     <l>—Nunquam ne reponam?</l>
                  </q>

               <p>In fine, after a tedious ſearch without finding any thing, me
thinks it might have been ſaid to me as to that other, <hi>Nunquid

                  <salute>Madam,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>HAd I been without my — I ſhould certainly have been
extreamly troubled to be depriv'd the honour of your ſight,
and I believe I ſhould have thought on you more heartily then
ever I did, for to tell you truth; I felt my ſelf extreamly diſpos'd
thereto, and never was ſo much afflicted at a departure from you.
But it is beyond your faith, Madam, what ſtrange diverſion — afford
a man, and what an excellent remedie they are againſt a
great paſſion; one while a Horſe falls lame, another, a wheel is
broken, ſometimes they are lodg'd for a whole night in a Bogg,
and I profeſs all can be done with them, is that they make a man
think three or four times a day on her, whom he thinks his beſt
friend. But now that we ſhall travel more gently, and are to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque
upon the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> I ſhall diſcharge my duty of thinking on
you better, and if I am not miſtaken, I ſhall come to <hi>Avignon</hi> the
moſt paſſionate man in the World. For your part, Madam, who
take no greater journeys then from your own houſe to the ſuburbs
of St <hi>Germain,</hi> and are not troubled with ſuch ill wayes as we are,
you are not by any means to be excuſed, if you honour me not ſo
much as to think on me ſometimes, ſince, I muſt needs tell you,
yon are more oblig'd to do it then ever, and if you are not often in
my thoughts; it is, when you are, with ſo much ſincerity and ſuch
reſentments, as wherewith I am confident you would be ſatisfy'd.
Beſides, who knows but I do often reflect on you, and that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
my ſelf thus modeſtly, becauſe I dare not tell you all? In this
uncertainty, I humbly deſire you, Madam, to believe only what
Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhall acquaint you with, for I have ordered him
to explain my intentions to you, and to tell you, ſince it is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

                  <salute>Madam,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Wiſh you had ſeen me the other day, that you might have
known what condition I was in from <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Valentia.</hi> The
day was newly deliver'd of the Sun, nor was he but weakely able
to guild the Mountain-tops, when we were gotten upon the
<hi>Rhoſne.</hi> It was one of thoſe fair dayes, which <hi>Apollo</hi> does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
adorne himſelf withal, and which are never ſeen at <hi>Paris,</hi>
but in the height of Summer. Thoſe who were of my company,
entertain'd themſelves one while with the ſight of the Mountains of
<hi>Dauphine,</hi> which were ſome ten or twelve Leagues on the left hand,
all covered with Snow, another, the Hills on both ſides the <hi>Rhoſne</hi>
loaden with Vines, and Valleyes as far as ſight could reach, burdened
with Trees which were green and flouriſhing. For my part, while
all were thus employed, I got up alone upon the Cabbin of boughs
which cover'd our Veſſel, and while they were admiring at the
things that were about them, I began to conſider what I had left
behind. I fix'd my right Elbow on the covering of our Barke,
which ſupported my head, the left hand being careleſſely ſtretch'd
out, wherein was a Book which I had taken only as a pretence for
my retirement. I looked earneſtly on the River, which yet I ſaw
not. There fell immediately tears of no ſmall bulk from my eyes,
my ſighes were ſo violent, as if they brought ſome part of my Soul
out along with them; and ever and anon there ſlipp'd from me
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115945:125"/>
certain words, pronounced with ſo much diſorder and confuſion,
that thoſe who were about me could not well hear them, and which
I ſhall acquaint you with when you pleaſe. What I now write to
you, would have been capable of more advantage and ornament, if
I could have put it into verſe, for I profeſſe to you, the Nymphs of
the Waters were troubled at my affliction, the God of the River had
a compaſſion for me; but all this cannot be well expreſs'd in proſe.
The reſult is, that I remain'd ſeven hours in that poſture, without
moving either hand or foot. I wiſh, Madam, you had but ſeen me
thus in any exerciſe of Religion; it would have rais'd no ſmall
devotion in you, in ſo much that the Maſter of our Veſſel ſaid, he
had in his time, carryed ten thouſand men from <hi>Lyons</hi> to <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caire,</hi>
but had never ſeen any that ſeem'd to be ſo much out of his
ſenſes. Having dreſſed up this fine ſtory, it juſt now comes into my
mind, that you will haply imagine there is not a word true of it,
and that what I have ſaid is meerly matter of invention to fill up a
Letter. Though it were really ſo, Madam, yet am I ſtill excuſable,
for to deal freely with you, a man is many times much at a loſſe
what to ſay, nor can I conceive, how, without ſome ſuch inventions
as theſe perſons, who hold not any correſpondence either as to love
or affairs, can often write one to another; and yet to be ingenuous
with you, all I have told you, of my reſvery, my ſighing, and my
ſadneſs, is punctually true. Only as to the reſentment which the
Nymphs, and the God of the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> had thereof, I am not over
confident; I ſpent a whole morning in theſe thoughts without the
leaſt remiſſion. During that time, I muſt confeſs, I thought three
or four times on Mademoiſelle — the reſt I wholly beſtow'd on
the Lady your Mother, and your ſelf. I had promis'd you, that if
we went by water, I ſhould come out of your debt as to that point;
and indeed I have done ſo much, that if I fall into the ſame poſture
again, the Sun that firſt ſhines on me in <hi>Languedoc</hi> will enflame me
into extravagance. It is already ſo hot in <hi>Avignon,</hi> that we can
hardly endure it. The Spring hath overtaken us already, there's
every where abundance of <hi>Fleas</hi> and <hi>Violets;</hi> I wiſh you both with
all my heart, for Madam, as I ſhall be glad, you ſhould not ſleep too
much in my abſence, ſo can I not but wiſh you whatever I ſee that
is handſome and beautiful, and remain,</p>

write to you, the occurrences which from time to time happen here
furniſh me with ſomething to ſay to you. Nevertheleſs, my Lord,
I muſt needs confeſs, I was infinitely ſatisfy'd with the laſt Letter
you were pleas'd to ſend me; and when ever you have ſuch pleaſant
news to tell me, I dare not refuſe the honour you do me in the

he hath the greateſt inclinations to oblige. He told me the other
day, that you had written him the handſomeſt, and moſt obliging

and more fit to entertain things of that nature. He hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me to entreat you on his behalf to return the greateſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
poſſible to our friend, for the Epigrams he made for him,
wherewith he is infinitely ſatisfy'd; to ſay truth, they are the
handſomeſt in the world. As for the Verſes directed to my Lord
Cardinal, they are abſolutely <hi>Virgilian,</hi> with a little more En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſme
then the Authour is wont to have; and for my part, had
I both my Arms broken on the Wheel, I ſhould take a pleaſure to
hear them. If it be any ſhame, that he, for whom they were made,
hath not yet ſeen them, the greateſt part of it will fall on Monſieur
<hi>de la Victoire,</hi> whoſe care it principally was. For my part, I have
contributed thereto all the care and affection I ought, and abating
all thoughts of the powerfulneſs of your recommendation, and the
paſſion I have to ſerve Monſieur <hi>de Balzac,</hi> I ſhould I profeſs,
have ſolicited with no leſs ardency, for a man riſen out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that ſhould have ſent hither what you have. All
the offence I have committed, is, that I have not written to you
ſooner; but you have pardon'd me far greater, and conſequently
will this, ſince I am,</p>

               <p>THere's nothing ſo certain as that I ſhould have an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
affection for you, if I ſhould never ſee you again, for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but two Moneths ſince I left you, it is double to what it
was, and encreaſes dayly ſo much, that If I ſee you not ſuddenly,
I queſtion not but it will defie all limits. To ſay truth, beſides
the ſatisfaction it is to have ſpent ſome time without any conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115945:128"/>
with you, and paſs'd over a Lent without any diſpute about
the Almond-milk; your Letters, Madam, have, I muſt needs
confeſs, contributed much to make me judge more favourably of
you, and think you more amiable. The two you have honoured
me with, have raiſ'd in me new matter of aſtoniſhment; and as if
I never had been acquainted with your perfections, and that every
one, to ſpeak freely, hath ſome little indignation at the reading of
thoſe things, which he might have written; yet I have, I aſſure
you, been extreamly pleas'd with them; they have diſpell'd all my
afflictions, they have in a manner cut'd me of all misfortunes, and
have infus'd into me a joy which I could not have expected here
but by enchantment or miracle. Of both which there is ſo much
in what ever you write, that I wonder not at all that they have
wrought this effect in me, but only that they have enflam'd with
an extraordinary impatience to ſee you again, ſince there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man, who had the advantages of his wit and ſenſes, and knew
you to be ſo miſcheivous as I do, but would rather deſire to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
at a diſtance of two hundred Leagues from you, were it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but to receive of your Letters. It ſhould, on the other ſide, be
your wiſh, that I ſate down content with this honour, and that I
came not neer you; for, doubtleſs, being far from you, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
I do you are greater, and you ought to conſider them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
And certainly when I reflect on all thoſe I have done you
ſince I left <hi>Paris;</hi> all the diſcourſe I had concerning you with
Monſieur <hi>de Rouſsillon;</hi> the aſſurance I gave of your affection to
the Count <hi>d' Aleix,</hi> the profeſſions I made to his Lady, that ſhe
was one of thoſe Perſons for whom you had the greateſt honour and
reſpects; the miracles I related of you to Madam <hi>de Saint Simon,</hi>
and the expreſſions wherewith I aſsur'd the Lords Deputies of
<hi>Marſcilles,</hi> of the good inclinations you had for them and their
City, methinks the main end of my travelling up and down the
world, is to procure you Servants, to keep up your correſponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and to dilate your reputation. Meeting yeſterday with my
Lord Preſident F— in the Kings Chamber, he fell into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of your excellencies; I told him, that he was very much
in your liking, and that it was long ſince that I had diſcover'd your
particular inclination for him. He is handſome, and believ'd it,
and I aſſure you, Madam, as alſo Monſieur <hi>de Chaveroche</hi> that
if ever you have any buſineſs in the Parliament of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> the
firſt Preſident will be your infallible friend. I am infinitely pleas'd
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115945:128"/>
to ſee what you acquaint me with of the Miſtreſſes of my Lord
Marqueſs of St. <hi>M</hi>— It is, I muſt confeſs, a great joy to me,
and to be abſolutely a perſon of Honour; it was but fit he ſhould
enter into that kind of life. To ſay truth, to faſten any thing on
his mind, that ſhould poſſeſs the place of that perſon which was
there, it were little enough to thruſtin ſeven at a time, and yet
he will have much a do in ſeven others, to find all thoſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he admir'd in one. In the mean time, I cannot but think it
ſtrange, and to deal freely with you, cannot underſtand a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
that a man can love ſeven perſons at a time; for my part,
I could never, when I was moſt prodigal of my love, go beyond
ſix, and it muſt certainly be very infamous to love ſeven. But,
Madam, ſince I perceive he is ſo much addicted to talking, and I
grown ſo melancholy, I believe, for my part; that our ſouls were
chang'd when he embrac'd me laſt, that I took my leave of him,
for ever ſince I have been in perpetual diſquiet, always wiſh'd my
ſelf out of the places where I was; nay, me thinks I have loved

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>an,</hi> more then ordinary. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this proceeds from the honour ſhe hath done me in her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
or from a neceſſity there is, that an affection ſo well
grounded ſhould encreaſe dayly: but I could wiſh, that where he
hath hitherto lov'd the gentleſt nature in the world, he had made
his addreſſes to that other you know, who expects, when any one
hath declar'd himſelf for her ſervice, that he perſevere and dye in
it, were it only to ſee what would have been the iſſue of it. And
certainly, it were but expedient, that for the advantage and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of all the world beſides, an unconſtant man ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
once in his life. I call him unconſtant, though he hath
done nothing but what was deſired of him; but it ſhould not have
been in his power to do it, and both for his reputation ſake, and
the reſpects I have for him, I wiſh he had dy'd rather. But we ſhall
one day ſee theſe Gallants unmercifully dealt with in the other
world. For my part, who am a ſinner as well as others, I have been
miraculouſly converted, and dare affirm, that my ſoul is in Paradice
as to that point. But Madam, what is it that you tell me of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of Mademoiſelle <hi>de V</hi>— and the Count <hi>de G</hi>— and where
hath fortune been ranſacking for theſe two perſons to join them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
I have much joy to wiſh for that of Mademoiſelle <hi>de G</hi>— and
the Count <hi>de F</hi>— there is a friend of ours who wil be very — at
that Wedding, and I am ſorry I cannot be at it my ſelf. All the

any thing common?

made of Madam <hi>de C</hi>— when in the mean time, you have dreſs'd
them up ſo, as that I have been extreamly pleas'd to ſee them all, and
you have embalm'd theſe bodies ſo well, that I ſhould not be much
more taken with the moſt young, and moſt healthy. Hence it may be
inferr'd, that a good workman doth miracles in all kinds of matter,
and this which, next to the firſt matter, was the moſt naked, and the
moſt indigent of all, hath receiv'd from you ſo excellent a form, that
you have made it, as it were another <hi>compoſitum.</hi> It is only you can
make <hi>Mercury</hi> of any kind of wood; this, whereof any other but

               <p>COnſider I pray, whether I deal not favourably and ingenuouſly
with you, ſince ſo ſpecious a pretence as that of a great jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
perform'd with ſo much precipitation, (for we are come
in ſix dayes from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Grenoble</hi> by Coach,) hinders me not
from giving you an anſwer? I received your laſt Letter a quarter of
an hour before my departure; I rejoyce at your proſperities as much
as if they were my own, and while I am unfortunate in whatever I
deſire, I think my ſelf fortunate, when you are ſo. For I cannot ſay
that Fortune is abſolutely my enemy, ſince ſhee is your friend, and
I forgive her all the miſchief ſhee hath done me, in requital of the
favour ſhee doth you. You will be aſtoniſh'd at what I ſhall tell you,
and truely I am aſham'd to tell you; M— is more unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

her, give me ſome advice in this caſe, and let me know, whether you

taken. But deal freely with me, and in ſuch an adventure as this,

above all others to deliver me out of this diſturbance, for beſides that
your affection to me ought to be greater then any man's, you are, in

               <p>NOt to diſſemble with you, all your Latine cannot exempt
you from ſimplicity, and it is eaſily diſcover'd in you that the
greateſt Clarks are not alwayes the moſt polite. I was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reconcil'd with M— within one quarter of an hour after
our meeting; we had hardly exchang'd two or three reproaches, but
we embrac'd one another more heartily then ever. Love ſneez'd
above two hundred ſeveral times that day, ſometimes on the right,
and ſometimes on the left, which brought him into a cold he hath
been troubled with theſe thre weeks. She gave me, <hi>mille, deinde cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
deinde mille altera, deinde ſecunda centum.</hi> See now what you
get by citing ſo unſeaſonably thoſe two Epigrams; for to tell you
truth, I conceive her very handſome about the noſe, and am of the
judgment of her neighbours; <hi>Sic meos, amores?</hi> There ought not ſuch
ſtrict notice be taken of what falls from Lovers in their paſſion, and
though <hi>Phaedria,</hi> coming upon the Stage, ſpeaks of <hi>Meretricum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelias,</hi>
yet in the next ſcene, he would ſoon quarrel with his ears,

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115945:130"/>
know you have of that fierce and imperſuaſible Nature, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
you would be cajoli'd thereby, and that you would write a
Letter that ſhould find us abundance of good ſport, but to the end
that you might oblige her, and pretend a regret for having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd

adoe to perſwade her to be guilty of that treachery towards you. This
is the reaſon, that you have not receiv'd oftener from her, and ſhee
hath purpoſely forborn, becauſe you ſhould not take her in a ly
twice. But we muſt do you that right as to acknowledge, that if you
are defective as to judgement, you have, to ballance it, a great wit;
I am infinitely taken with your Letter. There are ſome applications

or not, with what affliction, you may eaſily imagine. Amidſt
this alarm, I receiv'd, as very good news, that of your impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I could not be much troubled at the loſſe of your liberty,
when I had been ſo much in doubt of that of your life. Nor indeed,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115945:131"/>
my Lord, can I not but acknowledge, that if your deſtiny had been
in my hands, you ſhould have had no other then what you have:
and as I ſhould have been extreamly afflicted that you had been
found among the dead, ſo ſhould I not have been well pleas'd you
had clearly eſcaped. Fortune hath pitch'd on the mean I deſir'd, and
I believe I jump with your thoughts of it; for I conceive you would
not have enjoy'd your ſelf much in a liberty, which you muſt have
purchas'd by a retreat. When I am got to <hi>Paris,</hi> if you pleaſe to
ſend for me by a Drumme, as one of your menial Servants, I ſhall
not diſown the relation, but be ready to wait on you; I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
impatient for the relation of your Adventures, and now I
think you are at leaſure to make it. I wiſh, with all the paſſion that
may be, you may alwayes meet with good ones, and if, having ſix
or ſeven Miſtreſſes to grieve for, you have any time to ſpare, to
think on me, I humbly beſeech only to honour me ſo far, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

               <p>I Profeſſe it is out of pure conſiderations of friendſhip that I
write to you, and that I cannot but tell you, that I languiſh away
here, for want of your company. After I had made ſuch haſte to
get out of <hi>Italy,</hi> I grow wearier of <hi>Paris</hi> then ever I was of <hi>Turin,</hi>
and having very excellent accommodations of Lodging in <hi>Crequi</hi>-Houſe,

into a pleaſant poſture, then I do now in the faireſt dayes of all: and
to tell you all in a word, I ſhould be content to entertain M— four
hours every night, conditionally I might enjoy you but one
half hour in the day. Seriouſly, Sir, I cannot imagine otherwiſe of
my ſelf then that I am fallen into a Pit, whence fourty fadome of
Rope will hardly get me out; nor is there any but you that can do
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115945:132"/>
it, and therefore till you are return'd, I ſhall continue there crying
and roaring after a ſad manner. There paſſes not a day over my
head, wherein I make not ſome addition to the affection I bear you,
and whether it be that I have more leaſure to reflect on my ſelf, and
conſider the obligations I ow you, or that converſing with other
men, I make greater diſcoveries of the extraordinary difference there
is between you and them, I have greater reſpects for you then when
I was upon my journey, when yet I had greater for you then for my
ſelf. You will pardon me, that I tell you this with ſo much freedome,
and not think it ſtrange, that ſpeaking with much paſſion, I expreſs
my ſelf the leſſe conſiderately. Notwithſtanding all this liberty, I
have in my Soul the humbleſt reſpect I ought to have for you, and
that, honouring you ſincerely, proportionably to your merits, I am,

               <p>SInce I am now far from your Highneſs, and that you cannot put
me on any imployment, I am reſolv'd to give you an account
of all the thoughts I have had of you of a long time, and which
I durſt not trouble your acquaintance withal, for fear of ſlipping
into the inconveniences, wherein I had obſerv'd thoſe entangled,
who had preſum'd upon the like freedome with you. But, my Lord,
the things you do are too great to admit of ſilence, and it were very
unjuſt you ſhould think to do ſuch Actions, and that there ſhould
be no more ſaid of them. If you but knew how all at <hi>Paris</hi> are broke
looſe into diſcourſe concerning you, I am conſident it would make
you bluſh, and you would be withal aſtoniſh'd to ſee with how little
reſpect, and leſſe fear to diſpleaſe you, all the World talks of what
you have done. To be free with you, my Lord, I know not what
your thoughts run upon, and it was certainly an exceſſe of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and an extraordinary violence in you, to have, at your age,
baffled two or three old chieftains, whom you ſhould have reſpected
though it were but for their Antiquity; brought the poor Count
<hi>de Fontain</hi> to be meat for worms, though one of the braveſt men
in all <hi>Flanders,</hi> and whom the Prince of <hi>Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is Uncle to the <hi>King</hi> and Brother to the <hi>Queen,</hi> one with whom
you never had the leaſt difference, and defeated the beſt Troops of
<hi>Spain,</hi> after they had with ſo much mildneſs given you paſſage. I
know not what Father <hi>Meuſnier</hi> will ſay of it, but all this is diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to good manners, and contains, in my judgement, much
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115945:133"/>
matter of <hi>Confeſſion.</hi> I had indeed often heard that you were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of an inconvincible obſtinacy, and that it was not ſafe to diſpute
any thing with you; but I muſt confeſs I ſhould not have believ'd,
it could have arriv'd to this height; for if you continue thus, you
will become inſupportable to all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo far will the <hi>Emperour</hi>
and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> be from being able to oppoſe you. But, my
Lord, not to meddle at all with matters of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and to mind
only thoſe of <hi>Policy,</hi> I congratulate your Highneſs, the gaining of
the greateſt Victory, and of greateſt conſequence of any hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
in this age, and that without being <hi>important,</hi> you do thoſe
actions that are ſuch in ſo high a degree. <hi>France,</hi> whom you have
clear'd from thoſe ſtorms it ſtood in fear of, is aſtoniſh'd to ſee you,
at the entrance of your life, do an action ſuch as wherewith <hi>Caeſar</hi>
would have been glad to crown all his, and which returns to your
royal Anceſtors more luſtre then you had deriv'd from them. You
now verify, my Lord, what was heretofore ſaid, that Vertue comes
to the <hi>Caeſars</hi> before it's time; for you, who are a true <hi>Caeſar</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition
and ſcience, a <hi>Caeſar</hi> in diligence, in vigilance, in courage
<hi>Caeſar, &amp; per omnes caſus Caeſar,</hi> have eluded the judgements, and
exceeded the hopes of all men; you have diſcover'd that experience
is only requiſite for ordinary Souls, that Heroical Vertue is acquir'd
by other wayes, that it knows no degrees, and that the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces
of Heaven are in their perfection, even from their beginnings.
Having done this, you may eaſily imagine what entertaiment and
careſſes you are to expect from the Grandees of the Court; and
how the <hi>Ladies</hi> are tranſported to underſtand, that he whom they
have ſeen triumph in the <hi>Bals,</hi> does the ſame thing amidſt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
and that the handſomeſt head in <hi>France</hi> is the beſt and beſt
ſettled. There's not any, even to Monſieur <hi>de Beaumont,</hi> but
ſpeak favourably of you; all thoſe who were revolted againſt you;
and complained that you were ſtill miſtaken, acknowledge that for
this time you are in the right, and ſeeing the great number of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
you have defeated, there is not any one who fears not to be
of it. Give me leave, <hi>O Caeſar!</hi> to be thus free with you, receive
the Elogies which are due to you, and permit that we render to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>

keep there. I have been alſo told, that you, conſidering with
your ſelf that many Armies have been heretofore loſt, through
their Baggage, have fairely rid your ſelf of all yours; and that,
having often read in the <hi>Romane</hi> Hiſtories (See the fruits of
great reading!) that the greateſt ſervices their Cavallerie ever
did, were when they voluntarily alighted, and ruſh'd on foot
into the brunt of the moſt doubtful Battels; you have accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
reſolv'd your Horſes ſhould not be near you, and have
taken ſuch an excellent courſe, that you have not ſo much as
one left.</p>

               <p>You will haply find it ſomewhat inconvenient; but certainly,
it muſt be acknowledg'd, there's no ſmall honour in it, that you
may ſay as well as <hi>Bias, (Bias</hi> an old Gentleman you are well
acquainted with!) that you carry all you own about you. We
do not meane thereby, a quantity of unneceſſary accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nor a number of Horſes, nor yet any great abundance of
Gold and Silver; but honeſty, generoſity, magnanimity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in dangers, obſtinacy in diſpute, a contempt of forraigne
languages, ignorance of falſe dice, and an unheard of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for the loſſe of fraile and periſhable goods. Theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are peculiar and eſſential to you, ſuch as neither Time nor
Fortune can deprive you of. And whereas <hi>Euripides,</hi> who was,
as you know, or know not, one of the graveſt Authors of all
<hi>Greece,</hi> writes in one of his Tragedies, that mony was one of
the evils that came out of <hi>Pandora's</hi> box, and, it may be, the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115945:138"/>
moſt pernicious; I cannot but admire in you, as a divine qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
the incompatibility there is between you and it, and look
on it as an excellent qualification of a great and tranſcendent
ſoul, the antipathy it hath againſt that corrupter of Reaſon, the
venome of minds, and the author of ſo many diſorders, injuries,
and violences. But yet my Lord, I ſhould wiſh your Vertue
were not ſo high-flowne, that there were ſome correſpondence
between you and this enemy of mankinde, and that you would
make ſuch a peace with him as we do with the great <hi>Turk,</hi> out
of conſiderations of policy, and Commerce. Since then a man
cannot well be without it, and imagining that as I play'd for
you at <hi>Narbonne,</hi> ſo have you for me at <hi>Thionville.</hi> I ſent you
a hundred piſtolls, being ſomewhat more or leſſe than what
you are out upon my account, and that they may not have the

               <p>YOu would not be a little pleas'd with your departure
hence, if you knew how extreamly you are regretted
here. It is not certainly neer ſo great a pleaſure to be at <hi>Paris,</hi>
as to be wiſh'd there as you are; and though you were now as
much in love with it as ever, yet the general complaints of all
the Vertuous might raiſe in you a certain ſatisfaction that you

that great perſon whom his indulgent Fortune ſirnamed the
<hi>Taker of Cities,</hi> deſerv'd not the title with as much juſtice as
you; for if it be true that there is no better way to reduce them
then by taking in the hearts of the Citizens, the World never
knew ſuch another <hi>Poliorcetes,</hi> and we may number <hi>Hambrough,
Coppenhagen, Stockholme, Paris, Venice</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf among
your Conqueſts. You cannot eaſily believe what ſadneſſe this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115945:138"/>
place hath put on for your departure. For my own part, my
Lord, I am ſo diſorder'd at it, that nothing affords me the leaſt
diverſion. To do you right; in what other perſon could I
meet with ſuch an exceſſe of wit, knowledge, and vertue?
Where could I meet with ſuch excellent diſcourſes, a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo advantageous, and ſuch noble entertainment? Since
your departure, here I could never meet with any meat which
were not too much ſalted, nor any man which were not too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
<hi>Omnia aut inſulſa aut ſalſa nimis.</hi> I cannot meet with
any thing my palate quarrels not at, <hi>nec convivium ullum, &amp;

the Ladies — ſuffer not the Cats to be much acquainted

not her marks. But how amiable ſoever ſhe may be as to her

there's not any will intereſſe themſelves in your misfortune.
<hi>I</hi> know not what account they will give for it, nor what excuſe
they can alledge that they have ſo little compaſſion for you.
For my part, my Lord, who am acquainted with your verie ſoul,
and know how exactlie you diſcharge all the duties of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<hi>I</hi> am ſatisfi'd, that you are extreamlie troubled, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how good a Brother, Kinſman, and Friend you are, <hi>I</hi> am
confident you are as good a Son; and that, having loſt a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who hath been regretted even by thoſe who knew him
not, your affliction muſt needs be extraordinarie. This is the
more commendable in you, by how much men in theſe times
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115945:145"/>
are little troubled with ſuch reſentments. This tenderneſſe of
ſoul is as much to be celebrated, as the conſtancie you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
in the greateſt hazards, and that in an age which affords
ſo few examples of good Nature you are caſt down for a loſſe
which makes you one of the richeſt men in <hi>France.</hi> This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
deſerves admiration, and indeed darkens all your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivements.
But as even the beſt things are not free from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
ſo your grief which hitherto hath been juſt, were not ſuch
ſhould it continue any longer. It were an <hi>indecorum</hi> for a man
whom <hi>France</hi> looks on as one of its <hi>Heroes,</hi> to afflict himſelf
as other men; and it were not to have a ſufficient eſteem of
Vertue and Renown, to perſiſt in landneſſe in a time when you do
ſuch glorious actions, and receive the acclamations of all the
World. <hi>I</hi> have heard the Queen loud and open in your praiſes;
wherein alſo a perſon much in her eſteem was no leſſe liberal;
your reputation encreaſes daily, and your wealth is never the
leſſe. For they ſay that in mony and poultry you will be hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
thought very conſiderable. If with all this you cannot
be ſatisfied, there's a friend of mine will have much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

your ſhrewiſhneſſe at <hi>Rouën,</hi> and that you have not parted with
all your humours, ſince you take ſo much pleaſure to perſecute

me. This conſidered, Madam, I muſt needs tell you I ſhould
have been glad to have been at your interview with the Sea, to
ſee what face you put on it, what you thought, one of the other'
and what happned on the day that the two moſt unruly things in
World met together. If conformitie beget affection, there
ſhould have paſſed a great friendſhp between you, for when I
conſider its calmes, tempeſts and roughneſſe, it banks, ſhelves,
and rocks, the loſſes and advantages it brings the world: how
admirable and incomprehenſible it is, faire to thoſe that look on
it, and dreadful to thoſe that are at the mercie of it; that it is
irreſiſtible, untameable, bitter, unmerciful, and inſolent, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
you are as like one another as two drops of water, and
all the good and ill that may be ſaid of that may be alſo affirmed
of you. There is onelie this difference Madam, that that,
though it be vaſt and great, hath its limits, and you have none,
and all thoſe that know your diſpoſition hold that it hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bottome nor channel. And I pray what Abyſſe hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
you with that deluge of Letters you have ſent hither,
which are all ſo excellent and ſo admirable, and ſuch as any one
of them would aske as much time to write as that of your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
amounts to? What other imagination would not be
drained to afford ſo much as ſhould gain ſo manie people, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit
ſo manie Judges, and write to ſo manie perſons? The Sea
indeed hath done you a courteſie, and it is an argument of your
good intelligence, that Madam <hi>de Guiſe</hi> was directed ſo oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunelie
to <hi>Rouen;</hi> and to make the Romance a little more
famous, Fortune hath done well to bring thither alſo a perſon
ſo conſiderable as you are. Do you not think that all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
of a Countrie would be delayed till you were there?

and <hi>I</hi> have read your Letter thrice over with great ſatisfaction.

ingenious in accuſing me; the latter part of your Letter is much
weaker then the other, and contrarie to what <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaies, <hi>de
coelo meliùs objiciente crimina quàm defendente, bonam ſiniſtram
habes, malam dextram.</hi> Firſt, if it be without any cauſe, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction
that you have not vouchſafed me an anſwer for ſo
manie months, and have denied me a note of three lines, tis a
proceeding, my Lord, not conſonant to your wonted goodneſs,
eſpeciallie in a time when what you have done for me ſeem'd to
oblige you to treat me with more civilitie, that it might not
be thought you relied too much upon the kindneſſe you had
done. For in fine, though <hi>I</hi> eſteem your courteſies yet <hi>I</hi> rather
wiſh your careſſes, and if it be not poſſible to be both among
your ſervants and your friends at the ſame time, <hi>I</hi> doubt not
but you will honour me ſo much as to believe <hi>I</hi> ſhould not be
troubled about the choice. But if it proceed from any diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
you have of me that you have been ſo long ſilent, <hi>I</hi>
cannot but be the more aſtoniſh'd that you ſhould ſuffer your
heart to be ſo long burden'd with a grudge againſt me, who
from my infancie have lov'd, honour'd and eſteem'd you, with
ſuch conſtancie and perfection, that notwithſtanding a manie
great and honourable friendſhips I have contracted ſince, never
any of my friends but have thought and obſerved, that of all
men, you were he for whom I had the greateſt inclinations, and
with whom, then any, I would rather ſpend the reſt of my life.
But notwithſtanding all this, and a friendſhip of five and
twentie years, if there be a report which you take offence at, you
think me the author of it, becauſe it hath ſome relation to the
interpretation I made of your riddle. And this muſt ſeem more
probable to you, then that a manie that are here, or with you,
ſuch as daily invent other Stories, ſhould alſo advance this.
Your Letter <hi>I</hi> was extreamlie taken with, that zeal which <hi>I</hi> have
in all things for you prevailed with me to read it to two of my
friends, and diſcover to them the conjecture <hi>I</hi> made of the blank
line. Neither they nor <hi>I</hi> thought that interpretation any way
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115945:155"/>
prejudicial to you, nor can think ſo yet. But we muſt not
diſpute it any longer with you; you ought to have the greateſt
care of your own reputation, and <hi>I</hi> commend that modeſtie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<hi>I</hi> be not thought guiltie of any extravagance. If, my
Lord, the eſteem you have for me proceeds onelie from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that <hi>I</hi> pretend to ſomething of wit, and that <hi>I</hi> can ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
write a handſome Letter, you eſteem me for the qualitie <hi>I</hi>
think moſt inconſiderable. Thoſe of my acquaintance here ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
me for my great profeſſions of friendſhip, candour, faith,
and diſcretion. Of all which if you have not found the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in me, you muſt needs have obſerved the ſeed of them
even from my youth. In a word <hi>I</hi> have much reaſon to take it
ill, that you have thought me ſo diſ-circumſpect, as to give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to a calumnie, ſince you call it ſo, and that having
thought me guiltie of it, you have not rather pardon'd it me.
For, to be free with you, you have not half the love for me you
ſhould have, if you have not a remiſſion for a many others. Be

ſuch excellent things, is much to blame that he writes them
not to ſome other who is able to apprehend them. Upon ſuch

               <p>I Believe you might faſten on the Moon with your teeth, had
you but attempted it. So far <hi>I</hi> am from being aſtoniſhed at
your taking of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> when nothing is impoſſible to you.
All <hi>I</hi> am troubled at, is, what <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay to your Highneſſe
thereupon, and by what extraordinarie expreſſions I ſhall be
able to repreſent to you what <hi>I</hi> conceive of you. The glorious
condition you are in conſidered, no queſtion, my Lord, but the
honour of your affection is a thing extremely advantageous;
but for us Wits, who are obliged to write to you on the good
ſucceſſes that happen, it is as diſtractive to be put to find out
words ſuitable to your actions, and from time to time to dreſſe
up new panegyrieks for you. Would you be pleaſed to take a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
ſometimes, or but raiſe a ſiege from before ſome place, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie
might help us a little out, and we ſhould find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might be handſomelie ſaid upon the inconſtancie of
Fortune, and the honour it is to ſuffer her diſgraces courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.
But having even from your firſt atchievements paralle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
you with <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ſeeing your dailie ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing things, the
troth is, my Lord, we know not where to place either you or
our ſelves, and cannot find any thing to ſay which is not below
you. <hi>Eloquence,</hi> which magnifies the leaſt things, cannot, with
all its advantages reach the height of thoſe you have done; nay
what in other ſubjects ſhe calls call <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> is but an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
manner of ſpeaking to expreſſe our thoughts of you. It is
certainlie not eaſilie comprehenſible in your Highneſs, that you

ſhould adde ſomething every ſummer to that glory which the
precedent Winters ſeemed uncapable of addition; and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
over-grown ſo great beginnings, and afterwards as great
progreſſes, the laſt things you do are ſtill the moſt glorious.
For my part, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> contribute that joy to your proſperities
I ought; but foreſee, that what addes to your preſent reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will derogate from what you are to expect from future ages,
and that within a ſmall time, ſo many great and conſiderable
Actions done in the neck one of another, will render your life
incredible hereafter, and will make Poſteritie look on your
Hiſtorie as a <hi>Romance.</hi> Be pleaſed then, my Lord, to ſet ſome
limits to your Victories, though it were only to accommodate
your ſelf to the capacity of mankind, and not exceed their belief.
Mind then for a while remiſſion and ſecuritie, and let <hi>France,</hi>
who in the midſt of her triumphs is ever in alarme for your life,
peaceably enjoy the fruits of that glory you have gained her.

               </opener>
               <p>I H have a great deſire to come and live with you in <hi>Poitou,</hi>
for <hi>I</hi> find that you and <hi>Mouſieur Pauquet</hi> are grown greater
wits ſince your coming thither then you were before. On the
contrary, I come out of a countrie where mine is grown ruſtie
in the aboad of fifteen daies, as being not bleſt with the ſight
either of good books or your Letters, and waiting on Ladies
who underſtand not a word of <hi>Cicero, Virgill,</hi> or <hi>Terence.</hi> To
deal truly with you, <hi>I</hi> am extreamly taken with all you write,
and unleſſe it be your abſence, there is no rate I would not buy
your Letters at. When ever <hi>I</hi> caſuallie meet with any thing
I conceive worth your acquaintance, <hi>I</hi> am not ſo much pleaſed
at what I write to you, as what I know you will anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

reputation as my own, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be extremalie jealous of you; but
I do not conceive it of much conſequence whether you or <hi>I</hi> be
the more learned or the greater wit, my reputation at <hi>Rome</hi>
will be the ſame; and I put ſo little difference between what is
yours and mine, that <hi>I</hi> am as much pleaſed at your Latine as
if <hi>I</hi> had writ it my ſelf. Methinks, there needs no more then
this to qualifie me for the Academie of the <hi>Humoriſts,</hi> and that
a man, who hath ſuch a friend as you are, deſerves entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
every where. <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaies, <hi>nemo ſperet ut alieno labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

means, be eloquent as often as <hi>I</hi> ſhall have need; and if <hi>I</hi> take
ſome pains to preſerve my Latine, it is not ſo much for any uſe
<hi>I</hi> ſhall make of it, as that I may underſtand what you write to
me, and what you do. I expect with impatience the gleanings
of the harveſt you have made in <hi>Poitou,</hi> and that you would
ſend me the beſt and choic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

partnerſhip there is between us is extraoodinarie, <hi>confers enim
rem &amp; induſtriam,</hi> and I, though <hi>I</hi> contribute nothing have
my part of the profit. The civill Lawyers call this <hi>Societatem
Leoninam,</hi> which the Lawes will not by anie means allow. I
know not what paſſage you mean, to which you ſay <hi>I</hi> have not
anſwered; be pleaſed to let me know it, <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> had left
nothing unanſwered. I almoſt ſubſcribe to your interpretation
of <hi>hem alterum;</hi> but methinks it is ſomewhat diſadvantageous to
<hi>Terence; I</hi> ſhould be glad, for his ſake, another might be ſound.
But as to the Ladies, who <hi>I</hi> told you knew not a word of <hi>Cicero,</hi>
pray give me your opinion of what <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaies of <hi>Sempronia,</hi> that

that he does obſerve it in a man, and that an eminent one, <hi>I</hi>

               <p>The excellencie of your Letters ſufficientlie excuſes the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunitie
wherewith I beg them. This laſt is admirable beyond
anie, I muſt acknowledge my ſelf in your debt. You verifie the
proverb verie much, that who is bound paies, onlie I wonder that
perſon, in whom there ſeems to be great riches, and who can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
part with them, is ſo hard to be brought to it. We favourites
of <hi>Apollo</hi> cannot but wonder that one who hath ſpent his whole
life in Treaties, ſhould write ſuch excellent Letters, and
ſhould be glad that you Gentlemen of Affairs did not meddle
with our Trade. And certainlie it were but juſt you contented
your ſelves with the glorie of having put a period to ſo many
important negotiations, and particularly that you are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in for the diſarming of all the ſeverall Nations of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
and not intrench upon that poor reputation which is gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the diſpoſall and Tacticks of words, and the fortune of
pleaſant imaginations. It is not over-honourable for a perſon
of your Gravity, and concernment to the publick, to contend
with us for Eloquence, or make it your buſineſſe, while you are
employed to reconcile the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and to
ballance the intereſts of the earth, to work an accommodation
between Conſonants that claſh, and to meaſure periods. Why
in Gods name, do you not content your ſelf with the making of
excellent and ſound diſpatches, ſuch as thoſe of the Cardinall
<hi>d' Oſſat,</hi> or, if you will be guilty of a greater ambition, thoſe of
Cardinal <hi>du Perron,</hi> but will needs trouble your ſelf with ſuch
as cannot but raiſe in us all the indignation in the world. You
will pardon me that I tell you this with ſome diſorder; nothing
but your Letter could have put me into it, as what hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved

You very pleaſantlie ſhift off the praiſes I gave you about

the Edifice you are at work upon now, that great Temple of
Peace, into which all the ſeverall Nations of Chriſtendome
are to enter, is much more worthy your endeavours, and is the
only deſign fit to employ your great Mind. I am elevated, my

fate to that other, <hi>Magnificentiae verae admiratio extat
Templum Epheſiae Dianae, ducentis &amp; Viginti annis à totâ Aſiâ

a much better workman. <hi>I</hi> ſhould be extremelie deſirous to be
here at the return of Madame <hi>de Longueville,</hi> after the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſo happie a Peace. What you tell me of this Princeſſe,
is handſome as her ſelfe, and I preſerve it purpoſelie to ſhew her
one day. No doubt but <hi>I</hi> ſhall judge more advantageouſly of you
you by your own writings, then by thoſe of <hi>Gronovius</hi> or <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Baldus</hi> which indeed are excellent, and ſomewhat approach
the character of the beſt part of Antiquity; but I find not in them
either the ſmoothneſſe or wit of our ancient Authour, and if you
have made any greater diſcoveries, you have found it only in
your ſelf. Conſider, my Lord, whether <hi>I</hi> am not happie, to
find in you the perfections which your Grand-father eſteemed
in <hi>Paſſerat,</hi> and the patronage which <hi>Paſſerat</hi> ſound in him.
Madame <hi>de Sablé,</hi> and Madame <hi>de Montauſier,</hi> are raviſhed at
ſome paſſages <hi>I</hi> have ſhewn them of your Letter, and would
needs have copies of that concerning Madame <hi>de Longueville.</hi>
Be free, my Lord, do you think it poſſible, <hi>I</hi> ſay not, in one ſingle
perſon, but in whatever the world pretends to as moſt handſome
and moſt amiable, do you, <hi>I</hi> ſay, think it poſſible, to meet with ſo
much wit, ſuch graces and attractions as are in that Princeſſe?</p>

I ſhall take his advice, and be more tender of my eares, he is
the God of good Counſel. And indeed when I had conſidered
the laſt things you were pleaſed to honour me with I thought
you greater and ſtronger then ordinarie, and was not at all
troubled that you had outgone me, when to do it you exceeded
your ſelf. My own Letter and the two I received from you, put
me in minde of the three lines which <hi>Protogenes</hi> and <hi>Apelles</hi>
drew by way of trial of skill. The firſt you ſent me was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
and worthie ſo great a Maſter, what I made upon it,
could not certainlie fall from an ordinarie hand, but the laſt,
which you have now drawn</p>

               <p>But they are ſuch, ſo noble and ſo ingenious, that, to be free

made of our Princeſſe is ſo rich and noble, that <hi>I</hi> have been
more pleaſed with the ſight of it, then haplie <hi>I</hi> ſhould have been
with hers, and you have found out a way to make an addition
to thoſe graces which before were infinite in her, <hi>tali opere

ſaies of the Greek Verſes which were made for <hi>Apelles's Venus,</hi>

all her attractions and charmes, <hi>pinxiſti &amp; quae pingi non poſſunt,

Beſides, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> think a mind employed to purchaſe
the quiet of all Europe is uncapable of being diſordered at the
death of a ſingle perſon how great ſoever he might be; and that
the conſtancie of your ſoule which hath manifeſted it ſelf on all
occaſions, will not be wanting in this. But the kindneſſes you

Romanis noſtris ſalibus condîta fecit allocutio. <hi>There you
have all my Latine at a breath, and the truth on't is,</hi> I <hi>have
not French enough to make you fully underſtand, as</hi> I <hi>could
wiſh, the true reſentments</hi> I <hi>have of your care towards me, and
the affection I perceive you have for me. I have not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
any thing by your Letter, which</hi> I am not infinitely ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with, and quarrell at nothing but the praiſes you give me;

Nay though you were taken with my <hi>Nardus,</hi> yet the reſt

               <p>For the paſſage of <hi>Terence,</hi> which you taxe me with paſſing by
without ſaying any thing of it, I think it was done becauſe <hi>I</hi>
would not perceive any difficulties therein. <hi>Cato</hi> would make
<hi>Thraſo</hi> underſtand, that having often heard that wittie replie,
and never learning who the Authour was, he had preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
it to be one of thoſe pithie expreſſions which above
a many others gaine reputation in proceſſe of time, and which
are remembred as Apothegmes, and does not mean, that he did
not believe it becauſe he was the firſt that ſaid it, but that before
that he had looked on it as an ancient ſaying; <hi>audieras?</hi> Gn.
<hi>ſaepe, &amp; fertur in primis.</hi> I ſee not what yould ſtick at there.
For my part, I fear me you underſtood it not, ſince you are ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
about it, and that you are one of thoſe,

               </p>
               <p>But certainlie it is in me a great preſumption, nay ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to ſpeak thus to a man who writes ſuch excellent things to
me; <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe, I learn more out of your Letters, then <hi>I</hi>
have out of all the books I ever read, and that if <hi>I</hi> am <hi>Magiſter
coenae,</hi> you are <hi>Magiſter ſcholae,</hi> or, to ſpeak better Latine, <hi>Ludi
Magiſter;</hi> which is as much, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid of <hi>Hirtius &amp; Panſa;

with the things you have ſaid of your ſelf, then what you have
quoted out of him. But amidſt the ſatisfaction it is to receive
of your Letters, it often happens, that the pleaſure <hi>I</hi> find in
reading of them, augments the regret <hi>I</hi> have that I cannot ſee

to be near a perſon that writes ſuch things, and who, were

Inſtead therefore of anſwering your Queſtions, I will
make others to you, and ask you how you underſtand that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> who ſayes that <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
battell, as <hi>I</hi> take it, that he gave <hi>Darius,</hi> engaged with
<hi>Darius</hi>'s Brother in the heat of the charge, who, ſayes he, <hi>armis
&amp; robore corporis multum ſupra caeteros eminebat.</hi> Some ſay
that <hi>armis</hi> is there put inſtead of <hi>humeris;</hi> others that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
armour, and that the meaning of it, is, that the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of his armour, his ſtature and ſtrength of bodie made him
remarkable beyond all others. Thoſe who hold the former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſay, that the Authour ſeemed to allude to that Hemeſtick
of <hi>Virgill</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—quàm forti pectore &amp; armis,</l>
                  </q>
that <hi>eminere</hi> will not hold in the other ſignification; that if he
would have repreſented him as remarkable for his armour, he
would not have ſimply ſaid <hi>armis,</hi> but <hi>fulgore armorum.</hi> The
others anſwer, that though <hi>eminere</hi> properly ſignifies to ſurpaſſe
in height, yet it many times admits auother ſignification, which
is, to be eminent ot remarkable, ſo that if <hi>armis</hi> ſtand there for
the ſhoulders, the word <hi>eminebat</hi> muſt be taken in two ſeverall
ſignifications: for in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

corporis,</hi> and to ſay that <hi>he was higher then all the reſt by the
ſhoulders and ſtength of body,</hi> were as improper. But indeed <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi>
is a word that cannot properly be ſaid but of <hi>Brutes,</hi> and is
never attributed to men but by the Poets, and conſequently,
it is irrationall to think that <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> who might as well

You may gueſſe ſomewhat neere, Sir, whether you are in my

nor yet knew what <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaies, that there's gold found in the

that the head and harpe of <hi>Orpheus</hi> were caſt into this
River,

               </opener>
               <p>IT is an extraordinarie ſatisfaction to all that love you to ſee
the attendance of Madam <hi>de Longueville</hi> ſo full and ſo free
of your praiſes, that it might be thought they had not ſeen in
all <hi>Germany</hi> but your ſelf, and were returned to <hi>Paris</hi> for no
other buſineſſe then to diſcourſe of you. I meet upon ſeveral
occaſions ſome I have no acquaintance with, who complement
me and make me proffers of their ſervices upon your account;
women and maids that will needs take me by the neck for your
ſake. But above all, their Miſtreſſe gives you thoſe praiſes
you may juſtlie claime, and after ſuch a manner, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſible
any other can do the like. It is long ſince that your
Lordſhip hath heard me ſay, that everie woman hath her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
but there's not any can pretend to ſo exact a one as ſhe,
and I am extreamlie pleaſed that it abſolutelie concurres with
mine as to what concerns you. All the World knowes that
you are a great <hi>Ambaſſadour,</hi> a great <hi>Miniſter</hi> of State, and a
great <hi>Man,</hi>

                     <l>Et pueri dicunt:</l>

but as to what they call a <hi>Vertuous man</hi> and a <hi>Gallant man,</hi> if <hi>I</hi>
may preſume to underſtand anything of it; no man ever arrived
to that height which you have, and yet this Truth is not ſo well
known to any as to Madam <hi>de Longueville</hi> and my ſelf. She
hath a verie high eſteem for your integritie, your prudence, your
magnificence, and your magnanimitie; She much celebrates
the great credit and veneration you were in all over <hi>Germany;</hi>
but above all, ſhe takes infinite delight to ſpeak of the delicacie
and beautie of your mind; of the acuteneſſe you have in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of excellent things, the facilitie to diſpenſe them, and all the
recommendable qualities which are rare even in <hi>Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and which ſhe ſaies ſhe never could diſcover in any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
your ſelf. In a word, ſhe knowes you as well as if ſhe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115945:176"/>
had looked through into your heart, whether ſhe have been
there I know not. She hath not mentioned a ſyllable to me of
the Letters <hi>I</hi> writ to you, though ſhe does me the honour to ſpeak
to me with much freedome, and that <hi>I</hi> have often put her upon
that ſubject. What ever you read here, my Lord, is ſomewhat
too gentle, and may very well admit of a corrective, but thoſe
<hi>Luſtres</hi> and <hi>Olympiads,</hi> which you have ſo well repreſented to
me heretofore, doth not this occaſion put you in mind of them?

Yet muſt <hi>I</hi> needs confeſſe, that <hi>I</hi> could not but a little bluſh at

beſides, that in the diſturbance <hi>I</hi> imagined you were in, at the

ſo well ſatisfied as to your good intentions, that when ever any
here quarrell at the ſlow progreſſe of the peace, and thoſe who
are thought (unjuſtly perhaps) not to contribute all they can
towards it, it raiſes matter of diſcourſe of you, ſuch as you

ſmall hope ſhe had left; for ſeeing that the peace could not be
concluded without a miracle, it is believed that it muſt be you
ſhall do it, and amidſt the publick conſternation, you are looked
at as a Sanctuarie. In the mean all things are ſo changed here,
peoples hearts ſo caſt down, and ſo little of enjoyment, that I
think there is no great matter of choice between an aboad at
<hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Paris:</hi> a man cannot meet with any who have not
their complaints, ſome that they cannot get their Salaries,

               <p>FOR God's ſake, let's once ſhake off this darke colour,
or if we muſt needs be in mourning let it be for your
abſence. <hi>I</hi> received your excuſes before you ſent them,
and you cannot but think me reallie ſatisfied you
were not in any fault, ſince <hi>I</hi> had the confidence to accuſe you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>I</hi> have taken more paines then you would have done your ſelf,
to finde out what might be ſaid in your defence; and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
with you, <hi>I</hi> made your cauſe ſo much my own, and
thought my ſelfe obliged to be ſo tender of your innocence,
that <hi>I</hi> durſt not omit any thing that might maintain it. For,
had you been found guilrie, <hi>I</hi> ſhould firſt have ſuffered for it,
nor indeed had any been ſo cruellie puniſhed as my ſelf. But
all this omitted, <hi>I</hi> have a greater opinion of my own fortune
and your courage then to doubt that either of them ſhould fall
ſo low. It is unworthie both you and me, to fear that an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſo well cemented ſhould by any caſualtie be diſſolved:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115945:181"/>
nay it is a crime in us but to imagine ſuch a thing poſſible. If
but one of thoſe two Gentlemen, with whoſe converſation <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
you, had ſtaid till day in your Chamber, <hi>I</hi> ſhould think
you could no leſſe then take a whole night to fall out with him
for it; nay though <hi>I</hi> ſhould have ſeen him in your embraces, <hi>I</hi>
think <hi>I</hi> ſhould have taken you for another, or that you had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
him for me. In a word, <hi>I</hi> ſhould rather diſtruſt the
fidelitie of my own eyes then your faith, and am more eaſilie
perſwaded <hi>I</hi> may be deceived in them then in you. No, your
entertainment of thoſe two men ſhall never finde my thoughts
any buſineſſe, nay though they had ſpent an Age with you, <hi>I</hi>
ſhould not believe you had beſtowed one quarter of an hour
with them. But <hi>I</hi> pray let me know, when you had diſmiſſed
the former, did you ſtay alone with the other, or did your woman
come immediatelie into your Chamber? Did they upon their
departure from you undertake that journey with as much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
as at other times? Do you ſtill feed them with thoſe
faire hopes, wherein onelie <hi>I</hi> eſteem them more rich, then if
they poſſeſſed all the World beſides? <hi>I</hi> am ſomewhat curious as
to theſe particulars, out of a confidence that <hi>I</hi> cannot but be
much pleaſed with them, and no doubt but <hi>I</hi> ſhould be rather
ſatisfied then any way diſturbed at that interview, were <hi>I</hi> but
fully informed thereof. But, in the mean time, they ſaw you,
while <hi>I</hi> was at a diſtance of thirtie Leagues from you, nay at
the ſame time that <hi>I</hi> was alone in my Chamber bemoaning
your abſence, they were in yours and heard you diſcourſe.
Nay it may be they ſaw you laugh, and that you gave one of
them occaſion to fall into ſome pleaſant dreames that night.
Ah <hi>Floricia!</hi> what a treacherous paſſion is jealouſie, and how
eaſilie ſhe inſinuates her ſelfe into us, while our Reaſon is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep!
I know that your paſt errours oblige you to verie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
conſequences, and that you are forced to manie actions
againſt your own inclinations and mine, to avoid running the
hazard of one thing which you think verie deare. But if you
knew how much I am caſt down at it, and how heavie theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
lie upon me, it may be, that another time you will
hazard any thing rather then my life; and yet you reproach
me with a negligence that I did not ſend you my picture ſoone
enough. But I pray, was it your deſire I ſhould have come and
made a third with the other two? or could you have wiſhed
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115945:181"/>
me preſent to be an eye-witneſſe of the entertainment you gave
them? This is ſo irrational, that my verie picture would not
have ſuffered it, for it would have been no leſſe then to put me
to death <hi>in effigie.</hi> Adde to that, I ſhould have felt ſomething
of it hence, and, no queſtion, have fallen into ſome languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſeaſe, not unlike thoſe who are killed at the diſtance of a
hundred leagues, onelie by pricking their images. But though
there were no ſuch thing to be feared, yet ſhould you not deſire
the ſight of my picture, eſpeciallie in the condition the firſt daies
of your abſence had put me into. All the Art of painting could
not have afforded colours ill enough to repreſent that which
ſadneſſe had cloathed me in; nor indeed can I ſee any likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that a man half dead ſhould be drawn to the life. You
would have found me quite another perſon, then what you had
ſeen ſo pleaſant in your companie. If I had ben well drawn
you would not have known me, for I hardlie knew my ſelf, and
might hardlie paſſe for an ill coppie of what I was a while ſince.
But I hope that after ſome ſhort time you will finde me more
cheerful and more divertible, for I begin to cleer up my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and if the Painter do but his dutie, you ſhall diſcover
in the Piece a certain hope, that it ſhall not be long ere you may
expect my attendance to ſecond that of my P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cture. Do you
therefore prepare your ſelf to entertaine me with more freedom,
and if you are yet at your own diſpoſal, let not the recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the <hi>witty Gentlewoman</hi> hinder you. I ſent her not
my humbleſt ſervices, but onelie returned thoſe I had received
from her by three ſeveral perſons; and I ſhould no have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to do it, had I not been afraid to offend you by retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing of hers. Beſides, you would ſoone have beene
informed, whether I had not made a conſcience to be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to you for a quarter of an hour by ſo unwelcome a refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as that. The ſame conſideration which prevailed with
you, not to acquaint me with the newes I have otherwiſe learnt,
made me ſtif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e this. But ſince we know all one of another,
and that the bad angel, which keeps us aſunder will needs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
all thoſe actions of ours which may any way give offence,
I beſeech you let us elude his malice, and ſo prevent him in this,
that knowing all things by a mutual communication, they may
put on quite another face; and for my part, <hi>I</hi> profeſſe to you,
I ſhall never be guiltie of any thing, which in any likelihood
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115945:182"/>
may give you offence, whereof I ſhall not preſentlie make my
confeſſion to you. Be you pleaſed to make me the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and withal, let me know whence you came to underſtand
that I had ſent recommendations to any one, and by what
means you have diſcovered that, wherebie I came to the newes
whereof I have made my complaint to you: for, to be free
with you, I am extreamlie troubled at it, and for my part, I
can think no otherwiſe then that you have ſome <hi>Genius</hi> about
me, who acquaints you with what is done. But ſince he tells
you all, aske him whether I love you, as alſo, how often in a

               <p>IT is certainlie a menace would ſtartle a more confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
then I am. But while you ſhall threaten me after this
rate, I muſt needs confeſſe I cannot much fear you, and ſhall be
ſo bold as to give you a meeting in the afternoone according to
your direction, what misfortune ſoever may be the conſequence
of it. I know your lodging is no ſecure place for me, and that
under pretence of the friendſhip whereof you are pleaſed to
honour me with a promiſe, there is not any one from whom I
ſhould far more miſchief then from you. But yet be pleaſed
not to leave me too long upon the Rack, for if you are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be kinde as you pretend, let this occaſion give you hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.
The truth is, my implicite obedience towards you, and
the reſignation wherewith you ſee I put my ſelf into your hands,
does in ſome ſort oblige you thereto. Though I know what
you have deſtined me to, yet ſhall <hi>I</hi> do all that lies in my power,
to ſatisfie that perſon, who you deſire ſhould be, at my charge;
and <hi>I</hi> promiſe you to keep her affection ſecret, without deriving

But happen as it may or will, <hi>I</hi> cannot endure too much, ſince
it is for your ſake <hi>I</hi> do it; for the two words which you thruſt

               </opener>
               <p>I Have clearlie forgotten all I ſhould have ſaid to — to
whom you would have me reconciled; and yet I muſt needs
tell you, it is not that I have ſlept ſince. I am diſpleaſed with
my ſelf, that I have had no more reſpect for a perſon, who
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115945:183"/>
had been recommended to me from ſo good hands, and that
not being able to afford her any roome in my <hi>inclinations,</hi> ſhe
hath found ſo little in my <hi>memorie.</hi> That is a certain part of
my Soul where I might juſtlie have allowed her a place, for that
is it which is the moſt oppoſite to <hi>judgement,</hi> and hath the charge
onelie of things <hi>paſt.</hi> But if I tell her any thing that favours of
obligation this afternoone, ſhe ſhall have no cauſe to complain
that I ſpeak to her onelie by heart; for I finde mine at ſuch a
diſtance from whatever I have to ſay to her, that if I have not
your immediate aſſiſtance, you will finde I ſhall be as far to ſeek
as you, both as to words and time. But, were it Heavens plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you knew not that of your departure, and that you were
not able to give me any account of it at leaſt for this day. For,
to deal truelie with you, I have not courage enough, to endure
the verie imagination of it, nay that verie thought ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fles in me
all other. When I conſider that to morrow you will not be to
be found here, I think it ſtrange I ſhould be in the World to
day: nay I am almoſt in an humour to acknowledge with you
that there is ſome fiction in the love I pretend to, when it comes
into my mind that I am ſtill alive, and that this affliction does
not abſolutelie make an end of me. Others have become ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
and confined themſelves to the deſerts of <hi>Thebais</hi> upon
leſſe diſcontents then mine. But if I tell you, that I cannot go
ſo far from you to bemoane my misfortune, I am, methinks,
the more to be excuſed, that I go not to endure an hermitage in
the wilderneſſes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſince I hope to finde a place in that
you are going to build. This hope is all that flaies me in this
World, my life hangs altogether on this conſideration. <hi>I</hi> know
not whether all <hi>I</hi> have ſaid here be within the limits of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
friendſhip; and yet you cannot affirm that <hi>I</hi> ſpeak to
you too clearlie, ſince you have ever had a priviledge to give
my words ſeveral interpretations: nor complain that <hi>I</hi> write
not to you in ſuch termes as you deſire, ſince <hi>I</hi> could never yet
meet with the man that ſhould teach me how to do it. While
my failings are connived at, and the diſcoverie of my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
allowed, <hi>I</hi> profeſſe to you, with the ſame affection as <hi>I</hi>
did yeſterdaie, that the onelie extravagance the World ſhall

LETTER VI.</head>
               <p>IT was high time for me to think of my Conſcience, and it
was a happie turne for me, that I made yeſterdaie ſome part
of my confeſſion; for I had not been yet ſo ſick as I am this
day, and my ſickneſſe encreaſes ſo, that, had I delaied it any
longer, I think I had died in a verie ſad condition. At leaſt,
to meaſure things by the fits <hi>I</hi> am troubled with, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
that torment me, <hi>I</hi> ſee my ſelfe falling into extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances
and enthuſiaſmes, and have no great hope to be, though
but for one hour longer, abſolute Maſter of my ſenſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectualls.
What perſwades me the more it will be ſo, is,
that amidſt the ſufferings &amp; afflictions which <hi>I</hi> expected ſhould
have ſwallowed me up, <hi>I</hi> cannot put on much ſadneſſe, and find
my ſelf leſſe troubled then ordinarie, though <hi>I</hi> am in the worſt
condition <hi>I</hi> ever was in in my life. <hi>I</hi> loſt, not manie daies ſince,
a deare friend, whom the exceſſe of his paine made inſenſible
thereof. His dreames made him laugh amidſt the pangs of death,
and his imaginations found him ſome eaſe, whileſt he was on
the rack of a Feaver. <hi>I</hi> beſeech you envie me not ſuch a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
as that, and ſince <hi>I</hi> have not eight daies to live, give me
leave to ſpend them after that manner. This granted <hi>I</hi> ſhall
acknowledge you merciful beyond my faith, and my ſelfe happie
beyond my hope. For an attempt ſo extravagant as mine
ſhould not meet with ſo good ſucceſſe, and after the commiſſion
of ſo high an effence, <hi>I</hi> did not expect to die ſo ſoon, nor ſo
quietlie. <hi>I</hi> crave your pardon; <hi>I</hi> thought not to have written
any thing to you but what concerned your friend, and now <hi>I</hi> firſt
perceive that <hi>I</hi> have not ſaid a word of her. I humblie beſeech
you to diſpoſe of both her and me as you pleaſe, onelie let me

you would have me to do it withall, or take it not ill, that I
ſhould make no preſents to others, of a good, wherein the
pooreſt are richer then my ſelf. <hi>I</hi> never had ſo many painfull
houres as the twelve <hi>I</hi> ſpent laſt, and ſince <hi>I</hi> had the honour of
your preſence, I have had ſo little reſt, that <hi>I</hi> dare aſſure you
there are few <hi>Feuillants</hi> but were better lodged then I. That
man, in whoſe heart you yeſterday left the dagger, hath had a
better night; <hi>Fear, regret, deſpaire,</hi> and all the poiſons of love
that are of a cold nature, were my perpetuall Tormentors; and
<hi>ſleep,</hi> which for ſome time would needs give me ſome eaſe,
hath been properlie to me the image of Death, ſince it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
repreſented to me that of your abſence. The condition <hi>I</hi> am
in conſidered, <hi>I</hi> do not think your friend would find anygreat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
in my company, unleſſe it be that her love muſt
needs be converted into hatred, and all her paſſions ſwallowed
up into that of Revenge. If this will ſerve, ſhe ſhall find in
me abſolute ſatisfaction, and ſhall be well pleaſed to ſee the
world affords ſome more wretched then ſhe. However, give me
leave to intreat you, what humour ſoever ſhe may be in, not to
leave me ſo much alone with her, that ſome bodie cannot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
us; and withall to conſider that there is no ſafetie for me,
whether ſhe love or hate me. <hi>I</hi> humbly beg this favour of you,
that in caſe <hi>I</hi> may ever have her. —I may not receive my
death from any other hands then yours, and that there may be
no need of any other Inſtruments, but that <hi>I</hi> may be ſtifled by
my own ſighs, and the diſturbances <hi>I</hi> am in for your abſence. <hi>I</hi>
know not whether you will begin, with this, to ſhew her the
Letters I write to you; but <hi>I</hi> ſhall not complain of it, provided
you give me leave to be gone immediately, and ſecure my ſelfe
in <hi>Spain.</hi> For that I think a remedie appliable to all ſorts of
misfortunes; and if you have permitted another to retire thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to avoid a feavour, you may very well excuſe me, if <hi>I</hi> go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>I</hi> ſhould be guiltie of ſuch a thought, an imagingtion of that
nature, being, methinks, too light to fall into a mind ſo deeply
afflicted as mine. However, ſince you everie year ſave one
mans life, and that you profeſſed yeſterday that you would do
all the kindneſſes that coſt you nothing; why ſhould <hi>I</hi> not hope,

made me ſpend this laſt without the leaſt admiſſion of ſleep, and
wounded me ſo deeplie in the heart, that <hi>I</hi> have not known any

that ſhe had had this newes from your own mouth. If it be ſo,
<hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> have ſome reaſon to quarrell with you, (having robbed
me of halfe my life) that, without any deſert of mine, you make

manner of dying that ſtartles me, and that I am to be excuſed,

permitted me to cloſe my eyes ſince yeſterday, and if this day
prove ſo long as the night laſt paſt, <hi>I</hi> am to fear your abſence as
a misfortune which cannot happen till after a hundred years.
But ſuch an unhappie accident ought to be foreſeen even at

               <p>THat neither grief nor love can cauſe any mans death, you
need no greater aſſurance then that neither hath yet made

If any thing could prevaile with me to diſpence with your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,

the torments I ſuffer, and the languiſhing condition <hi>I</hi> am
in, I think my ſelf all that is left of mankind upon earth, or
that I am tranſported into that corner of the world, where the
Sun is as ſeldom ſeen as Comets are here, and where the ſhorteſt
night is three moneths long. And yet, all this notwithſtanding,
my unhappineſſe were not arrived to the height, if the darkneſs

in the twilight of ſo long and tedious a night, I begin, alreadie to
count the houres, and that without breaking forth into impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
at every moment, as if a midſt the obſcuritie <hi>I</hi> am covered

ſince <hi>I</hi> received it, and indeed it is the only employment my eyes
have taken any delight in ſince they ſaw you. J this, J profeſſe,
J ſpeak trulie, and ſincerely, though J have diverſe times ſeen
your two good friends, being not any thing pleaſed either with
the voice of the one, or the actions of the other. When J went

her to repeat, made up one halfe of her diſcourſe, and her
geſtures the other. And though they are both excellent things
in their kind, yet all was not able to raiſe me out of melancholie,
great as the former wherein you had ſeen me; and <hi>I</hi> could find
nothing in her, that might any way alleviate the doome you give
me, that I never gain her affection. However, her friendſhip
might have proved more advantageous to me then you imagine,
and <hi>I</hi> ſhould addreſſe my ſelf to her with more earneſtneſſe then
<hi>I</hi> do, ſines ſhe hath crueltie enough to deſtroy thoſe whom ſhe
loves, when they are become as unhappie as I am. But <hi>I</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
ſhe would not do me that favour without hearing my
caſe, and that <hi>I</hi> muſt go through the rack to my death. At leaſt
ſhe began to put me on it the day <hi>I</hi> laſt ſaw her, and put a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
interrogatories to me concerning the cauſe of my tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which I am not out of yet. But a man who can bear with

that Torments ſhould force any thing out of me, when <hi>I</hi> am ſo

little for you, I could not but take occaſion to ſpeak of you;
this obliged me to ſtay there two hours longer then ordinarie,

could perceive both the one and the other break forth into fire
and jealouſie, whence I thought us ſufficientlie revenged; I of
him who had been ſo bold as to love <hi>Diana;</hi> and you of her
who had preſumed to love what belongs to her. I know not

without any hope of pitie or ſatisfaction. The laſt time I

me even when <hi>I</hi> feel them not, the only agitation of two
ſo different reſentments being enough to caſt me to the ground.

withall ſome of thoſe miraculous words, which you know, that
can reſtore ſtrength and cheerfulneſſe to the moſt indiſpoſed

               </opener>
               <p>I Am at this time a little in doubt how J ought to write to
you, for J am extremely diſ-ſatisfied with you, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
that you have not given me any account of your ſelf, never
wanting the opportunity to do it. What hinders me, is that J
would not ſay any thing whereat you might be troubled, or
might any way diſturb your quiet, for, aſſure your ſelf, J am
more tender of it then my own. But, withall, J muſt tell you,
that J cannot diſguiſe my reſentment of it from you, nor is it in
my power to uſe any artifice as to you, or write to you as J
ſhould, were J ſatisfied. To be free then with you, J cannot
conceive, how a perſon who hath done ſo many things for the
preſervation of my quiet, ſhould not in ſix weeks find leiſure
enough to oblige me with a Letter, and that you, who account
abſence a thing ſo dangerous, and ſeem to be in ſo much
fear it ſhould produce ſome ill effect in me, are ſo carried away
with it, and have, during ſo long time, neglected to make uſe of
the only remedie there is againſt it. It is now upon two months
ſince your departure, you had a certain direction how to write
to me, there were Carriers in all the places through which you
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115945:193"/>
paſſed and yet J have not had ſo much as one Letter from you,
What, in your opinion, ſhould J think of it? would you have me
think that at <hi>Orleans,</hi> at <hi>Blois,</hi> at <hi>Tours,</hi> at <hi>Angers,</hi> and ſince,
during all the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

J ſhould be the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſe haſtie for yours? It is indeed true, that
you were not obliged thereto, and that <hi>I</hi> ſeemed content, at
your departure, not to expect any from you, till you had had the
leiſure to receive ſomething from me. But ſhould you have done
the leſſe for that, and ſhould you not rather have thought it a
pleaſure to do me a kindneſſe when I leaſt looked for it? I had
left you ot your liberty; whether you would oblige me or no,
you have made made uſe of it, you have not written to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was at your diſcretion to do it or not. How then! if
you had perceived that J would have been content to ſtay four
months for a Letter from you, ſhould you not have written to
me all that time, for who can be content five weeks may as
well twentie? To deal freelie with you, I know not what
to think of it, might J object lightneſſe to the nobleſt mind,
and ſureſt heart in the world, J ſhould conceive you changed.
But any thing ſeems more probable to me then that. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

very heartilie) my affection is not a whit diminiſhed. It onely
takes anay ſomething of that ſecret joy which you had left me
in all my ſufferings, and the ſatisfaction it was to me, to think,
that ſince J have known you, you have ever had a care, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and kindneſſe for me great as J could wiſh, and that you

the leſſe, and you are as dear and precious to me, as when you
would needs be let blood everie day for my ſake, and were not
afraid to ſhorten your own life, to prolong the time you had to

<hi>I</hi> have, and you will not wonder <hi>I</hi> ſhould take ſo much pains
to get up again, after ſo high a fall. But, my M. be but pleaſed
to repreſent to your ſelf what hath happened to me in a few
daies; fortune hath directed me to the moſt amiable perſon
in the world, <hi>I</hi> have found her, <hi>I</hi> have ſeene her, <hi>I</hi>
have loved her, ſhe hath diſcovered abundance of good
inclinations for me, <hi>I</hi> have loſt her, and all this hath paſſed
ſo luddenlie, and was done with ſo much precipitation, that
I often doubt, whether <hi>I</hi> have been ſo happie as <hi>I</hi> imagine
I have, and that I have onlie dreamed what hath happened to
me. And indeed to ſpeak ſeriouſlie, ſo much friendſhip for me
from a perſon <hi>I</hi> was hardlie acquainted with, ſo much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and reſolution in a woman, ſo manie excellent qualities
in the ſame ſubject, and manie undiſcoveted treaſures at the
ſame time; and on the other ſide ſuch a number of accidents
one in the neck of another, ſuch a throng of good and bad ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
are things that ſeem rather to have been imaginarie,
then reall; there being hardly a fable which is not ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
as to pretend to more probabilitie then this. In a word,
my M. the pleaſant dream is over, I know not what is become
of all thoſe felicities, my reſt hath been diſturbed, and, awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>I</hi> find my ſelfe in the blackeſt and moſt diſmall night that
ever was. In the mean time, I endeavour to get it over with as
much patience as may be, and till the day does appear, I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
my ſelf with the moſt pleaſant imaginations <hi>I</hi> can. I cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
with my ſelf; that <hi>I</hi> derive joy enough for the remainder
of my life, from my having had your love, though but for one
minute, and that the very remembrance of this happineſſe,
ſhould engage me to a cheerfull ſuffering of all kinds of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115945:194"/>
I was not reaſonable that the moſt precious thing the
world could brag of, ſhould coſt me nothing. Fortune hath
been verie juſt in forcing me to buy the heart you have beſtowed
on me, and J am obliged to her, in that ſhe hath not called to
me for ſatisfaction for your love, till that after you had freelie
granted it me, at a time when you owed me nothing, and that
J could not look on it, but as the largeſſe of your own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
J ſhould therefore be verie ungratefull, if J ſhould now
be frugall of a few teares for a perſon who hath loſt ſo much
blood for me. <hi>I</hi> is now my turn to ſuffer, and it is but fit J
ſhould give you ſome aſſurances of my affection, after J have
received ſo many of yours. But you are ſo good, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
J ſhould ſuffer any thing in your preſence; and it was but
neceſſarie you ſhould be at a diſtance, that my martyrdom might
be thought the more meritorious. In fine, my M. you ſee with
what thoughts J endeavour to moderate the bittereſt ſorrowes
in the world, and to bear with the abſence of the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
and moſt inviting perſon that ever was. But, do what
J can, J muſt needs confeſſe, that many times my reſolution
and my reaſon forſake me, and J eaſilie perceive, that, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me not <hi>I</hi> ſhall not be able to hold out long. Be pleaſed then
to let me hear from you as ſoon as poſſible; aſſure me that you

affords, I could never be perſwaded you were ſubject to that
kinde of paſſion which cements together two ſouls of the ſame
nature... But proportionablie to the inclinations
which thoſe ſpirits above are pleaſed ſometimes to have for that
part of mankinde which they take into their protection, I have
thought it likelie you might regard my welfare, and that it was
impoſſible, that the moſt generous ſoul in the World ſhould
admit any paſſion but the pureſt that ever was. This acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged,

one action of yours, a ſmile, the caſt of an eie, a bluſh on ſome

in me that you abhorr'd me not; but an imagination ſo
weake, and ſo far from pretending to confidence, that it ſignifies
ſomething leſſe then opinion, a ſuſpicion, or doubt, which
lightlie moving upon my heart, left a certain track of light

if there were no other happineſſe or unhappineſſe in the world

that our two ſoules are not yet well ſodred together, and
eaſilie diſcover that you have given me but a verie ſmall
part of yours, ſince J want a ſupplie of courage to ſtruggle
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115945:201"/>
with a ſingle affliction. 'Tis true, if we conſider aright, that
what <hi>I</hi> have to deal with, is not of that kind of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
which conſtancie teaches men to endure with patience;
nay Reaſon, with all its rigour and ſeveritie, cannot diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

grieve for the moſt accompliſhed, the moſt generous and the
