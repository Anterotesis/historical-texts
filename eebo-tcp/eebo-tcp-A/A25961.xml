            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>1. A Valediction to the WORLD.</head>
            <l>HEnce all you Viſions of the Worlds delight,</l>
            <l>You treach'rous Dreams of our deluded ſence</l>
            <l>Paſſion too long hath ſeiz'd on Reaſons Right,</l>
            <l>And play'd the Tyrant in her own defence:</l>
            <l>Her fluttring Fancies hurry'd me about,</l>
            <l>To ſeek content which I could ne're find out.</l>
            <l>If any pleaſure did ſlide o're my ſence</l>
            <l>It left a mark of ſhame when it went thence.</l>
            <l>And when poſſeſt, it reliſhed no more;</l>
            <l>And I remain'd as Thirſty as before:</l>
            <l>Thoſe pleaſant Charms that did my heart ſeduce</l>
            <l>Seem'd great purſu'd, but leſſ'ned in the uſe;</l>
            <l>And that falſe flame that kindled my deſire</l>
            <l>E're I could caſt, the pleaſure did expire.</l>
            <l>But Reaſon now ſhall repoſſeſs her Throne</l>
            <l>And Grace reſtore what nature had o'rethrown,</l>
            <l>My better Genius prompts me to declare</l>
            <l>Againſt thoſe follie's, and to ſide with her:</l>
            <l>She tells me 'tis high time to ſtemm that Tide</l>

            <l>Thoſe brutal Paſſions do un-man our mind,</l>
            <l>And rule, where Virtue had them ſlaves deſign'd</l>
            <l>Such uſurpation ſhall prevail no more,</l>
            <l>I will to Reaſon her juſt Rights reſtore:</l>
            <l>And make my Rebel heart that duty pay</l>
            <l>To her, which on my ſence was thrown away.</l>
            <l>But this (dear Lord) muſt be thy act not mine,</l>
            <l>Thy Grace muſt finiſh what I but deſigne</l>
            <l>It is thy pow'r alone that firſt doth move,</l>
            <l>Then gives us ſtrength to execute and love.</l>
            <l>For Nature hath by cuſtome ſo prevail'd,</l>
            <l>And ſuch dominion on our ſence intail'd,</l>

            <l>And ſure we loſe it when we do diſpence</l>

            <l>Since then thy bounty doth my heart Inſpire,</l>
            <l>Make me to do, as well as to deſire:</l>

            <l>By thy ſweet force my Stubborn will Incline</l>
            <l>To quit my Conduct, and to follow thine:</l>
            <l>So ſhall my Soul thy double purchaſe prove</l>
            <l>Bought by thy Bloud, and conquer'd by thy love.</l>

            <l>And when his love and nature were at ſtrife</l>
            <l>He vallu'd more his ſuffering, then his Life.</l>
            <l>And ſhall Opinion have more pow'r to move</l>
            <l>Then his Example, Doctrine, and his Love?</l>
            <l>Love makes Afflictions eaſie; to complain</l>
            <l>Leſſens the merit, and augments the pain.</l>
            <l>Let's humbly then Submit to his deſign,</l>
            <l>And give that freely which we muſt reſign:</l>
            <l>So ſhall our Loſſes prove the beſt Increaſe</l>
