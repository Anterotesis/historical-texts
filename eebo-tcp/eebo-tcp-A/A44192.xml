            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first Point in this Case is,</hi> Whether these
tvvo Statutes are still in Force and not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed?</p>
               <p>They are not Repealed by the Act
that Repeals the <hi>Triennal Act:</hi> That
being no way contrary or inconsistent with
the two former Laws, and therefore doth not derogate from
them. If we have not a Parliament every year the King neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
the two former Statutes. But if we have not a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in three years the king neglects not only them, but the
last Statute of his own making.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62613:3"/>There is a rule in Law, that if Laws and Statutes seem to
be contrary, the one to the other, yet if by interpretation
they may stand together, they ought so to do. In this case
there is not so much as a seeming contrariety. <hi>Rol. Rep.
part. 1. fol.</hi> 91.</p>
               <p>So likewise, <hi>fol.</hi> 91. If a Statute extend in words to Repeal
another statute, yet if the intent of it was not to repeal it, it
shall not be repealed. And it is evident, there was no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to prejudice or weaken these Laws, both by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
speech, made the 21 of <hi>March</hi> 1663, to the <hi>Parliament;</hi>
as also Sir <hi>Edvvard Turners</hi> speech (then Speaker of the
House of Commons) made the 17 of <hi>May</hi> 1664, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of that Session. The offence taken was at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and means in and by which the Act of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
First did appoint a <hi>Parliament</hi> to be assembled. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Title of this Act declares they intended a repeal, but
of one Act, <hi>viz.</hi> that of King <hi>Charles the first,)</hi> but also the
very Act it self mentions and allows these Statutes of <hi>Edv.</hi> 3
to be Laws in force, and approves them.</p>
               <p>But if there were as there is not any colour that these Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
are hereby repealed, yet it is plain that the Statute of
the 16th. of <hi>Car. 2. Cap.</hi> 1. (which should make the repeal)
is not to take place till after the determination of this <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
The words are, <hi>That hereafter the sitting and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Parliaments shall not be intermitted or discontinued above
three years, but that vvithin three years from and after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of this present Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>your Majesty,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>do issue out your Writs,</hi> &amp;c. Here the enacting part of this
Clause doth not take place till after the determination of this
present Parliament. And the word (<hi>hereafter)</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Clause, has clearly reference to that time; and
with what Grammer or sence doth this redition (<hi>But that,</hi>
&amp;c.) otherwise correspond to the preceding words, which
will be plainer, if you suppose it penn'd, <hi>But that vvithin three
years from and after the end of tvventy years, next ensuing;</hi> shall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62613:3"/>
not in that Case the word, <hi>hereafter,</hi> refer to the end of
twenty years, and if this Parliament survive this Progogation
there may not be much odds in point of Time, whether of
the two wayes the clause had been penn'd.</p>
               <p>That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have not duely nor constantly
observed these <hi>Statutes</hi> ever since their making, doth not
render them of less force; For the Kings Omissions to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
a Law, or his personal Offences, can never be drawn into
question Judicially, because the King is not under any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
nor accountable to any Court, and is so far, and in
such respect <hi>Solutus legibus;</hi> But all Acts of the king con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to law, are adjudged to be in deceit of the king, and
the law voids and nullifiies all such Acts, <hi>Hobart.</hi> Page 154.</p>

                  <hi>The next point is,</hi> Whether the King is bound by these Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,

then the Princes present thoughts of their Expedience.</p>

Statutes that are made for the maintenance of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reason will tell us, if we consider the nature and business
of parliaments, That we ought to be secured of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a time certain, and the Law has prescribed this of a year
and no other to be that certain time.</p>
               <p>The parliament Rolls 5 <hi>Ed. 2. No.</hi> 29. and the 1. <hi>R. 2. N.
59.</hi> are both express in the Case, and that because the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is the only Court wherein the Subjects can recover
their right without the fear of delay, or the oppression of
great Men. And how could they answer any of those ends,
if the time prescribed by the <hi>Lavv,</hi> be not punctually obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62613:5"/>An absolute and direct law, and not <hi>sub modo,</hi> as under
forfeiture of such a sum, or such a penalty, cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with by the king, but all his Acts against it are nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
nay this reason and rule is extended to Common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and cases; that when a Statute prohibits a thing to be
done, it makes a nullity of any thing done against it, if there
be not a penalty limitted in the statute for the breach of it.</p>
               <p>Our king in his answer to the House of Commons of
the 24 of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1672 declares, that he doth not pretend
to the right of suspending any Laws wherein the Properties,
Rights and Liberties of any of his subjects are concerned.
and all our Properties, Rights and Liberties are bound up in
those laws of annual Parliaments.</p>
               <p>But this Fancy of Dispensation, cannot take place with
any man that considers the first of these two statutes, <hi>viz.
That a parliament shall be held every year once, or more often
if need be.</hi> Where the king is left only Judge of the need of a
Parliament oftner than once a year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but whether the king
see need or no, it is absolutely, positively and peremptorily
ordeined, <hi>That a parliament shall be holden once a year.</hi> And
to make any other interpretation of the said law, is to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that the parliament did by that Act change the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law,
which gave us a right to annual frequent parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
and deliver it wholly into the Will and pleasure of
the king. And so the next statute of 36. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to this sence, <hi>viz.</hi> For maintenance of the said Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and statutes an redress of divers mischiefs and grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which daily happen, a parliament shall be holden every
year, or once in 20 years, as the king please. But admit the
last words of the statute of the 4th <hi>Ed. 3. (if need be)</hi> runs to
the whole sentence, yet according to this sence, The king is
obliged to call a parliament within the year if there be need,
and a prorogation for 15 mouths puts it out of his power to
call them what ever need there may be.</p>
               <p>Neither will the preamble of the statute of the 27. <hi>Eltz.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62613:5"/>
Chap.</hi> 8. help the matter, it would be very hard, that a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
of an Act of Parliament should repeal or enervate
statutes of that consequence, especially when the enacting
part hath not a word to that purpose: but in truth this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
is far from an allowance, for it is a complaint of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
not being so often holden as in antient time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Subjects of this Realm are greatly hindred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
of Justice.</p>
               <p>It is worth the considering, how the King should have
more power by the law to deprive us of constant annual
<hi>Parliaments,</hi> than he had to deprive us of the four Terms in
the year, or the four Quarterly Sessions of the Peace. In
<hi>Johnsons</hi> and <hi>Norton's</hi> Case, it is there said, <hi>That the King
cannot adjourn the Courts of</hi> Westminster-Hall <hi>intermitting a
Term, and that to do so vvould be a breach of</hi> Magna Charta,
(<hi>nulli negabimus, nulli deferrimus Justitiam.)</hi> And is it not
as high a breach of the great Charter to intermit the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Court of Judicature beyond the time appointed by law?</p>
               <p>It is very true the king is trusted with the time when they
shall sit, so it be within the year, for that is positively pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the law; so also is the king trusted with the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Commissions to the Judges and Justices of the Peace,
which he may as legally omit and frustrate those laws, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the appointing a time within the year by his Writ for the
<hi>Parliament</hi> to meet. And it is evident, that it was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of that great king, <hi>Edvv. 3. That the Lavv of the Realm
is such, that upon mischifs and dammages vvhich happen to
the Realm, the King ought and is bound by his Oath, vvith the
accord of his People in Parliament, thereof to make remedy and
lavv.</hi> And in truth there is great reason that the king should
be more especially obliged by his Oath to the laws of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,
that being of highest concern.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this point with an Argument to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of such as do fancy the king can dispence with laws of
so great moment and concern. Those Worthies must allow
<pb n="01" facs="tcp:62613:6"/>
that where the King can dispence he is not intended to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
without a Clause of <hi>non obstante</hi> to the statute he doth
dispence with. And there is no such clause in the Record
of Prorogation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>If these statutes do oblige the king, the next point is,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Prorogation be contrary to those tvvo statutes of <hi>Edw.</hi>
3. and vvhat the Consequences are thereupon?</p>
               <p>The statutes are, That a Parliament shall be holden eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
year. This prorogation being for above twelve months,
intermitts a whole year, for the statutes say, There shall be a
Parliament holden once every year, or oftner; And the
Prorogation saith, there shall be no Parliament holden for
15 months, then next to come.</p>
               <p>It is a foolish fancy to imagine that the statutes are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
answered, since a Parliament was holden in 1675. and
another Parliament shall be holden in 1676; for in all cases
where the Law speaks of a <hi>year,</hi> or <hi>a year and a day,</hi> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
and reckoned for twelve Calendar months, to
take its relation and date from the subject matter that the
Act treats of; If otherwise, the sence of the statute will be,
That a Parliament shall be holden once in two years.</p>
               <p>And it is plain that in <hi>Richard the second's</hi> time it was not
so understood: For his first Parliament dissolved the 18th
of <hi>November,</hi> his next parliament began the 20 of <hi>October</hi>
following, where the Chancellour gives us the reason for
summoning the parliament then, That the king would
keep well his Covenant in holding annual parliaments. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
Abridg. fol.</hi> 173.</p>
               <p>If this intermitting a parliament for above an year, be
not contrary to these statutes, what can be? There is no
difference to be made of any measure of time beyond a
year, and there is no bounds to the time of a prorogation if
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62613:6"/>
it may exceed that, it may be as well for ten or twenty years,
and yet the Judges said in <hi>Harrison's</hi> Case, That in every
statute there is some bounds set that must be kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lex &amp; Consuetudo Parliamenti</hi> are dear in this case of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
parliaments, neither will the single uncontested presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
passed <hi>sub silentio,</hi> the 5th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> alter the Law and
custom of parliaments; There the parliament was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogu'd
from the <hi>second</hi> of <hi>October, quinto Eliz.</hi> to the 5th of
<hi>October, sexto Eliz.</hi> being a year and three dayes, and let it
be granted that this prorogation for fifteen months, is as
good and valid in Law as that: If they are both illegal, the
one cannot support the other, no more than her commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Wentvvorth</hi> and another Member in <hi>October</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in that very parliament, for what they said in the House,
shall take away the Liberty and Freedom of speech the
Members in either house enjoy by Law and Custom of
Parliament. In the Case of Tythes, twenty years pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will not prejudice him that can afterwards prove a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus

several statutes to prove a <hi>modus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law-Books tell us,<note place="margin">Cook, 4. Rep. Slades Case.</note> That

are established to us by
Common-Law,<note place="margin">Co. 12. Rep. Fol. 65.</note> Statute-Law, and
the Reason even of the Government it self. Neither can
the Laws that were made in that Parliament be at all weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by it now; Their Validity depends not upon the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of that Parliament, wherein they were made, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the distance of time since their making<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> during all which
they have been received without contradiction, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
into our Laws. Time and general reception, and
multitude of Interests involved, creates an authority to that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62613:7"/>
which fresh and earlier pursuit would have rendred invalid,
as also highly criminal in those that made it. 'Twere a
very hard case if one single Act of the Crowns, contrary to
law, because not observed or contested, should be of force to
repeal and set aside the Common-law, several Statute-laws,
and the constant course and usuage in all Ages. But if there
be any use to be made of this president, it is that it shews us
the opinion of that time, That a parliament in every year of
the kings Reign did comply with the old Statutes, but this
will do no service in the present case, for as our prorogation
is contrived, the 28 year of this kings reign is without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
whereas Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s prorogation began the
second of <hi>October,</hi> in the fifth year of her reign, and ended
the 5th of <hi>October</hi> in the sixth year of her reign.</p>
               <p>The Reason of the Government in other cases, as all
Courts of Judicature which are setled by law, and can meet
without the kings particular Commission, as the Courts in
<hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> the Sessions of the peace, the County-Courts,
the Hundred-Courts, the Court-Leets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fixed to a day certain for their beginning, or limitted
within a time certain, and all within a year. Those that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
begin without the kings particular Commission, ought,
<hi>ex debito Justitiae,</hi> to be granted whenever the Subject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
it; especially if there be no other remedy for the
Subject. So also parliaments are limited within a
time certain, which is within a year, for therein the law is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
but as to the particular day and place, and the durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their sitting, which could not be so well reduced into
a fixed and positive Law, they were trusted with the king, as
the proper subject of his Prerogative.</p>
               <p>By all this it will appear, that a prorogation for more than
a year, is contrary not only to these two Statutes, but also to
the Reason of the Government, the law and custom of the
Parliament, and the Common-law it self, and therefore ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
in all and every respect: And an illegal Act of the king
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62613:7"/>
is void and null in law. My Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> speaks very ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this Case, <hi>Hob. pag.</hi> 154. upon a lapse devolved to the
Bishop, and at last to the King. where he saith thus. <hi>A
Lapse is an act and office of Trust reposed by Lavv in the King,
the end of vvhich Trust is to provide the Church of a Rector,
and therefore tho the King may suffer the Church to stand void
(vvhich yet is</hi> Culpa) <hi>yet he cannot bind himself that he vvill
not fill the Church, for that vvere</hi> Injuria, &amp; malum in se, <hi>and
therefore shall be judged in Lavv in deceit of the King. For,</hi>
Eadem mens presumitur Regis, quae est juris &amp; esse debet.</p>
               <p>When it is said, That the prorogation is void and null in
Law, it is only to be understood that it is so far void and null,
as it is contrary to Law; for, the prorogation doth two
things; <hi>First,</hi> It puts off the Parliament and all business be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and determins the Authority they at that time
have, and this part of a prorogation can never be illegall, for
the King can dismisse a Parliament and determine their
Authority at his own pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It appointed a time when they shall meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and their authority revive. Now this part of a proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is bounded by the Law, which says, <hi>a Parliament shall
be holden once a year,</hi> and therefore, if the appointment to
meet again be not within a year, it is as if there had been no
appointment at all; and such a prorogation is only a dismissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Parliment and a determination, not a reviveing of
their Authority.</p>
               <p>To all this there are some <hi>Objections</hi> which ought to be
considered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62613:8"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The King might have dissolved this Parliament
and called a Nevv vvithin the year, and therefore these Statutes
might have been observed notvvithstanding the Prorogation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ansv.</hi> This is a clear confession of the invalidity of the
Prorogation, since it is allowed those Statutes will not be
pursued unless the prorogation be annull'd, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that subsists by it, dissolved: Neither doth the kings
power to remedy it by another Act, support the validity of
this; for then no Act of the kings, though never so much
against Law, but may be as well justified, he having power
left in him to remedy it. if he thinks fit, which is an excellent
way of rendering our law Arbitrary, and the Power of the
Crown Absolute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The King hath frequently by shorter Prorogations
and adjournments intermitted Parliaments for several years,
vvhich is the same as if he had prorogued them at once for so
long time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The case is directly different between these two,
the shorter prorogation being within the letter of the Law,
and those above a year directly contrary, tis very true it is as
much a part of the statute, that mischeifs and grievances,
should be redressed at the Parliament, as that a Parliament
should be holden; yet nevertheless, though a King hereafter
or in times past, has or shall, <hi>de facto,</hi> by short prorogations,
evade the force and intent of those Laws against his Duty
and Oath, that does not argue or prove, that therefore he
may, <hi>de jure,</hi> make a prorogation above a year, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
those Laws: the wisdom of the Law doth in such cases
put the king to renewing his Acts, and to bring them under
a fresh consideration, <hi>Year Book</hi> 39. H. 6. as in the case of
Pretections, where the kings protections for a year stand
good, though several times repeated, yet one and the same
protection for more than a year is utterly void. So the king
can grant an exception to one single person from serving in
Juries, and so to as many single persons as he shall find cause,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62613:8"/>
and such exceptions shall be good in law, but the kings Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to exempt all in such a County is void, because of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
that ensue in such a case. The kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
extends only for the good of the people, never to
their prejudice or great inconveniencies. In like case, the
Judges have a power to give a day to the parties pleading
before them from one Term to another, and may renew the
giving of a day from Term to Term, as often as they see
cause, but they cannot give a day during life, or for tearm
of years, the reason is, that this power or lesser prerogative
is intrusted with them for the better dispatch, and not for the
overthrow of Justice. Besides the Parliament doth really
assemble and sit at the time of every adjournment or proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and the length or duration of their sitting doth not at
all concern the state of this Question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They may as well
say, the king need never call a Parliament, because he can
by law annually hold a Parliament for two or three days,
and then end them, not having suffered them to do any of
the business of the Nation. Which is to argue from the kings
power abused, which power ought to be exercised for the
protection and better execution of the laws, to a nullity of
the law it self.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, It is no argument to say, the king
is trusted, you have no remedy against him, you cannot compel
him, for that is the very reason why all illegall Acts of the
king are null and void<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. <hi>Cok.</hi> 14. where there is a contrariety
between the Law and the kings single Act, so as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand together, the kings Act cannot over-rule and
make void the Law but the law makes void the kings Act;
all the kings Acts are under the power, operation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the law, and the law makes them either valid or
void, according as they correspond or not with it, <hi>D, St.
22.</hi> 23.</p>

               <head>IV.</head>
               <p>Since the prorogation cannot revive or continue the
parliament unto the 15th. day of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1676. being in that
particular contrary to law, and so void and null: The next
point will be. <hi>Whether the Parliament be still sitting, and hath
been so ever since the prorogation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To clear this point, it would be worth the asking, If the
Parliament should pass Acts in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March</hi> next, to
what day should they relate? Must the members be allowed
their priviledges and their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> during this time? and a
thousand more such like questions would arise.</p>
               <p>But it is clear that a Parliament prorogued is a Parliament
not dissolved, but continued over to another day; and when
the prorogation is legal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is a Parliament continuing,
but not sitting. To express the matter clearer, it will not
be un-useful, either to the clearing this point or the better
understanding the whole question in general, to explain the
law of Parliaments in this place.</p>
               <p>If a Parliament meet, though afterward they be proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
or dissolved before they make any Act, yet this in law,
while it was sitting, was a Parliament holden. The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are affirmed or reversed in such Parliaments are
good in law, and so are all other their proceedings, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
shall be paid. A <hi>Writ of Error</hi> then brought, would have
been returnable at <hi>presens Parliamentum,</hi> and in pleading it is usually said, <hi>ad parliamentum incoat.</hi> such a day, <hi>&amp; ab inde
per prorogationem continuat.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Next, That a Session of parliament in law so called, is when
there is an Act passed, and takes in all that time, that is, from
the time of the meeting either by Summons or prorogation,
until the time the parliament is prorogued or dissolved, for
during all that time, they are in law looked upon as sitting,
and all that sitting is called a Session.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62613:9"/>Next, if a Parliament be summoned and meet, and then
be prorogued either before or after any Acts passed, that
this is a Parliament continued.</p>
               <p>Therefore 'tis <hi>Parliamett. continuat. per diversas Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatione
us<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> ad</hi> such a day, <hi>&amp; tunc tent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Parliament and Session of Parliament are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
things; every Parliament must be before it can make
an Act, therefore it must be and must have continance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can make a Session, and all the while that it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
it is a Parliament in being but when it is prorog'd
it cannot be said to be a Parliament sitting, or that tis
then holden, but by the prorogation is put off from sitting,
or being holden, but continued.</p>
               <p>Hence you may observe the mistake of the Judges in
<hi>Huttons Rep. Fol.</hi> 61. in not distinguishing between Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Session of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Next, In this case, <hi>de facto,</hi> there was no sitting, but all
departed, and the King hath summon'd them by his Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
to Assemble upon the 15th of <hi>Feb.</hi> So the king
doth not know they are now sitting. And though this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
for the Causes abovementioned, be not a legal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation,
and consequently not sufficient to perform the
kings will to continue the parliament, and cause them to
meet again on the 15th of <hi>February,</hi> Yet the kings pleasure
hereby declared shall be so far effectual, as that they shall not
be sitting in the mean time. For though the king mistakes
the Law, yet his Acts are not void in those parts of them that
are agreeable to Law. It would be a contradiction in Law
to say, That a Parliament cannot sit but by the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the king, and yet be sitting contrary to his pleasure
and will declared.</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62613:10"/>There is no president since the beginning of Parliaments,
of any Parliament that was once <hi>sine die,</hi> that ever came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
again. So that <hi>Lex &amp; consuetudo Parliamenti</hi> is against
it; and if we break through that, a Parliament may be any
thing, every thing, nothing as the king please, and no man is
wise enough to forsee what inconveniencies and mischiefs
may thereby break in upon us. Whosoever will puruse the
Rolls and Records of parliament, shall find them very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act

which and to which they were adjourned or prorogued;
And if a continuance to a day certain be not so necessary
that the king cannot dispence therewith, why should the
parliament meet meerely to prorogue, as they have done in
all times? Why besides the prorogation are there alwayes
Commissions to continue them over?</p>

               <p>The parliament is like those other Courts, they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

               <p>If we should once depart from <hi>Lex &amp; Consuetudo Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi>
let this following Instance amongst many be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered;
A King, or a Protector, in the Infancy of a king,
shall prorogue a Parliament <hi>sine die,</hi> and when they are all
dispersed to their several habitations, he shall in three dayes
notice summon 12 Lords, and 40 Commoners, well princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
well paid, and near at hand for his purpose, he may in
few days change the Religion, subvert the rights and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perries
of the Nation, and enslave the people by authority
of Parliament, or the Protector (such as he may be) may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Succession, destroy our Priuce, and place himself in
his room. But to all this will be said, The law and custom of
Parliaments require 40 days notice, which secures us from
such a mischief.</p>
               <p>It is replyed, That there is no stronger law and custom for
the 40 dayes, notice than there is against Prorogations above
a year, or Parliaments, <hi>sine die,</hi> and if the kings prerogative
can extend to the more essential parts, it may to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the time of notice: The king that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our old Stautes supported by the Law and Custom of
Parliaments, can prorogue a Parliament to a time never so
remote, or, <hi>sine die,</hi> (that is, to no time) which is farther
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62613:11"/>
distant if he pleaseth, and hath no end but with his Life, can
by the same prerogative make the time of notice as short as
he please, that being piescribed by no Statute, and only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon the law and custom of parliaments, and has
been invaded by a more dangerous president than any other
point of the law and custom of Parliament has been.</p>

parliament by writ to the Sherffe, returnable the 7. day; he
durst not venture upon a parliament discontinued, and so
disolved by the resignation of <hi>Ri.</hi> 2. though they assembled
but the same day that his writtes went out for a new, and
notwithstanding they were such men as he planly approved
of, yet new writs of Sumons and a new return of the Sherifs
was thought Essential at that time.</p>
               <p>To all this is objected that <hi>Ano.</hi> 33. of <hi>E.</hi> 1. the parliament
was dismised the 21. of <hi>March</hi> without limiting any day cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and it doth appear, that an order was made in <hi>pleno
parliamento</hi> on the 6. of <hi>April</hi> following, so that the same
parliament dismissed, <hi>sine die.</hi> was recalled and sat again,
<hi>Ryley,</hi> 240. 279. 282.</p>
               <p>To this is answered that this record will not be of validity
to change our Laws, and constant practice of parliaments
ever since they were setled. The Original Book in the
Tower (of which) <hi>Riley,</hi> is a copy) was but extracts out of
the close Rolls, and some parliament Rolls since lost, and
a mistake in trancscribing the date of the record may very
easily happen for that the former leave given was a disolution
is eviedent, becase the members of the house of Commons
tooke out there Writ for Wages, whith in those times,
was never taken out till after the Parliament was dissolved.
And, if to be dismissed, <hi>sine die,</hi> be a disolution, the question
is gained; and is matters not much, whether this be an Order
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62613:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Prelats and Temporal Lords, with advise and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the privie Council and Judges, for these were all
ordered in the dismision to stay behind and attend. And the
words, <hi>in pleno Parliamento,</hi> might be inserted, to distinguish
it from an Act of the privie Council alone; which is the
more probable, both because the nature of the Order is such,
as the Kings Counsel alone could have made, and the dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of time from the 21th, of <hi>March,</hi> to the 6th. of <hi>April,</hi>
was too short for a recealing of the Members; and too long
to suppose them to have continued of themselves neer the
Court, and within call Or whether the king did call the same
Parliament after a dissolution, which the same king had don

               <p>This Record is worth the Observing; it has not only
setled the point, that our Kings could not have the same
Parliament after dissolution, or being sent home returned

that the people of <hi>England</hi> ought not only to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

               <p>To conclude this Objection, Let it be considered how
weak a proof the date of this Order is in so great a point, to
prove a parliament recalled after a dismission <hi>sine die,</hi> would
require Journals of their sitting, Writs by which they were
summon'd, or for wages, or Acts which were allowed to be
in force, and of such a nature, as none but a Parliament could
do; none of which are in this case.</p>

the Kings pleasure, to order their occasions accordingly.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the late troubles, the king by procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
adjourned the Courts at <hi>Westminster</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Writ of adjournment; and since the Return of his

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To this may be said, That no man or number of
men (except the king) can by matter of Record Dissolve
a Parliament: It is the right and prerogative of the king
alone to do that. But there are several other wayes by
which a parliament may naturally or violently come to its
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62613:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
end, To make the expression plainer, let this instance be
offer'd; no man hath authority to kill any of the kings subjects
without a lawful Commission derived from him; yet any of
his Subjects may die naturaly or be killed violently, and
though the person that did it be liable to punishment yet the
subject is not alive. The death of the king or the resignation
of his Crown, are known and confessed to be the natural,
death of the parliament as well as of those other courts, As
also the return of the king from a forreign Country into
<hi>England</hi> determines a parliament summon'd by his lieutenant
in his absence, as appeares expresely by the Act of parliament

               <p>If a parliament should continue as long as this, and the
king should issue no writs to fill their vacant places, it is more
than probable, that would prove a natural dissolution.</p>
               <p>If the Gunpower treason had taken effect, or any such like
wicked or sad accident should happen it would prove a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
dissolution of the parliament; So that cheif Justice <hi>Lee</hi> in
in <hi>Huttons Rep. Fo.</hi> 62. was as much out in point of Law, that a
parliament cannot be dissolved but by the king and by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of record, as he was in good sence when he spoke of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance
of Parliaments by matter of Record:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primo Mariae,</hi> was a great Question, whether
the Parliament then summoned was not void?<note place="margin">Dyer, 98.</note>
Because 26 H. 8. <hi>C.</hi> 1. and 35. H: 8. <hi>C.</hi> 3. did
unite and annex the Title or Stile of <hi>Supremum Caput Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seae
Anglicanae,</hi> to the Crown, and this Title or Stile was
omitted in the then writs of Summons: Some of the Judges
and Queens Council thought this was not a necessary part
of the Queens Stile, others thought otherwise, but it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
of all hands that supposing the Statutes of <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62613:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Eighth had extended to have made this a necessary part of
the Queens Stile, the force of the same Statutes had made
void the parliament; so that it appeares evidently by this
that it was their Opinion, that a parliament might be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the force of former statutes, though the kings express
pleasure for the dissolving of it did not otherwise appear
upon record.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Decimo. sept. Car.</hi> 1. was an Act made that the Parliament
should not be dissolved, prorogued, or adjorned, but by their
own consent by Act of parliament: Here the kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
of dissolving Parliaments is limited by an Act, so that
it is plainly subjected to former Statutes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Trienal Act</hi> it self, is an Instance beyond exception,
this parliament which repealed it, admitted it to have been
a binding Law, else what need it to have been repealed? By
this Act the kings prerogative was limitted both in calling
and dissolving parliaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ex abundanti</hi> it might be said, That Acts of Parliament
can bind, limit, restrain and govern the Descent and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Crown it self, and all rights and titles thereunto.
This was practised in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, and in the
thirteenth of <hi>Eliz.</hi> The affirming, holding, or maintaining
the contrary was made Treason during her Life, and after
her decease, forfeiture of all Goods and Chattels.</p>
               <p>Neither is there any form of words necessary for the king
to use in the Dissolving the Parliament: If he bids <hi>them go
