            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vpon the earth: In her other hand, was held an <hi>Oliue</hi>

<hi>Virgil,</hi> being thus,
<q>—Deus nobis haec otia fecit.</q>

            <p>The opposite body to this (on the other side, and

to intercept your royall passage. These are my

to giue it a full and a bounteous welcome, beeing a
Messenger sent from the Lady <hi>Eirene</hi> my Mistresse, to
deliuer an errand to the best of all these Worthies,
your royall selfe. Many Kingdomes hath the Lady
sought out to abide in, but from them all, hath shee
beene most churlishly banished: not that her beautie
did deserue such vnkindnes, but that (like the eye of

them.</p>
                  <p>At last heere she ariued, <hi>Destinie</hi> subscribing to this

In contempt of which happines, Enuie
shootes his impoisoned stings at her heart, but his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
(being charmed) turne their daungerous heads

away with vexing to see her prosper, because all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintauce

two other cleare and gracious starres shine cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie

no dutie should bee wanting) shee hath giuen
leaue euen to Strangers, to bee Sharers in her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
by suffering them to bid you likewise welcome.
By mee (once hers now your vassaile,) shee entreates,
and with a knee sinking lower than the ground on
which you tread, doo I humbly execute her pleasure,
that ere you passe further, you would deigne to walke
into yonder Garden: the <hi>Hesperides</hi> liue not there but
the Muses, and the Muses no longer than vnder your
protection. Thus farre am I sent to conduct you thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
prostrately begging this grace, (since I dare not,
as beeing vnwoorthie, lackey by your royall side) in

               <p>And being (in this their returne) come neare to

all their Cornets, that his Maiestie was at hand:
whose princely eye whilest it was delighting it selfe
with the quaint obiect before it, a sweete pleasure like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
courted his eare in the shape of Musicke, sent
from the voyces of nine Boyes (all of them Queristers
of Paules) who in that place presenting the nine Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
sang the dittie following to their Viols and other
Instruments.</p>
               <p>But, least leaping too bluntly into the midst of our

you round about it, and suruey the Walles, Allies,
and quarters of it as they lye in order.</p>
               <p>This being the fashion of it.</p>
               <p>The passages through it were two gates, arched
and grated Arbor-wise, their heigth being 16. foote,
their breadth 10. from the roofe, and so on the
sides, downe to the ground, Cowcumbers, Pompions,
Grapes, and all other fruits growing in the land, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
artificially in clusters: Betweene the two gates,
a payre of stayres were mounted with some 20 assents:
at the bottome of them (on two pillers) were fixed
two Satiers carued out in wood; the sides of both the
gates, being strengthened with foure great French
frames standing vpon pedestals, taking vp in their full
height 20. foote.</p>
               <p>The vpper part also caried the proportion, of an

whereof was exalted aboue the other two, <hi>Fortune</hi>
standing on the top of it. The garnishments for the
whole Bower, being Apples, Peares, Cheries, Grapes,
Roses, Lillies, and all other both fruits and flowers
most artificially molded to the life. The whole frame
of this somer banqueting house, stood (at the ground
line) vpon 4 foore; the <hi>Perpendicular</hi> stretching it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to 45. Wee might (that day) haue called it, <hi>The

danced round about it; for in one place were heard a

(which sate in sight) a set of Viols, to which the Muses
sang.</p>

verie excellently well, will suffer them to bee great in

his Maiesty, his name <hi>Vertumnus,</hi> the maister Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and husband to <hi>Pomona:</hi> To tell you what cloathes hee had on his backe were to doo him
wrong, for hee had (to say truth) but one suite:
homelie it was, yet meete and fit for a Gardener:
In steade of a hat, his browes were bound about
with flowers, out of whose thicke heapes, here and
there peeped a queene apple, a cherie, or a peare,
this boon-grace hee made of purpose to keepe his
face from heate, (because he desired to looke loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie)
yet the sunne found him out, and by casting a
continuall eye at him, whilst the old man was dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his arbours, his cheekes grew tawnie, which
<pb facs="tcp:10075:27"/>
colour for the better grace, he himselfe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

hands: in the one he held a weeding hooke, in the

fruitfull Cynthian garden, began to droop and hang
downe their greene heades, and to vncurle their
crisped forlocks, as fearing and in some sort, feeling
the sharpenesse of Autumnian malice, are now on

a fresh and more liuely verdure than euer they were
before. The nine Muses that could expect no
better entertainement than sad banishment, hauing
