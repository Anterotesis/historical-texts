         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

FOVNTAINE
Of free Grace opened.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> What meanes hath God provided for mans
ſalvation?</p>
            <p>A. God ſo loved the world, that he
gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternall
life, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>Q. Is it the duty of all mankind to believe in him for
Salvation?</p>
            <p>A. Yea.</p>
            <p>Q And why?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe eternall life is promiſed to whoſoever
doe believe in him, and eternall death is threatned
to them that doe not believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are not all under the penalty of everlaſting
damnation though there were never a Chriſt to
be believed on?</p>
            <p>A. Yes ſurely, for ſo it doth appeare, Rom 3. 9. 23. ch.
3. 12, 16, 17. 18. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106078:4"/>
Q Why then is eternall death threatned to mankind
for not believing in him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For two cauſes: Firſt, for that Chriſt having
ſuffered the puniſhment of our ſins, we ſhould not
ſuffer if we believe in him; the want of which
therefore cauſeth our ſins to reſt upon us ſtill:
and Secondly, becauſe the not believing in him is
the neglect or contempt of mercy offered, and
ſo a grevious ſin, and doth deſerve condemnation
more then any other ſin of any other kind, <hi>John</hi> 3
18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 3. 4.</p>
            <p>Q. Hath Chrict then ſuffered the puniſhment due for
the ſins of all mankind?</p>
            <p>A. Yes ſurely, for ſo it is written 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 15, Heb.</hi>
2. 9 1 <hi>Tim 2 6. Iſa. 53. 6. Iohn</hi> 1. 29. and 3. 16. 17.
2. <hi>John 2. 2. John 6. 51. &amp;</hi> 4. 42. &amp; 12. 47.</p>
            <p>Ob. Then all mankind muſt needs be ſaved, or elſe
God be unjuſt in puniſhing our ſins in Chriſt, and in us
alſo.</p>
            <p>A. It doth not follow, for though our ſins are
puniſhed in Chriſt, yet they are not pardoned in us
unleſſe we believe: hence it is that we are juſtified
by faith in Chriſt, not without: for he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not ſhal be damned <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. and the reaſon is,
becauſe elſe Chriſt hath not the Honour of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atourſhip
as means of pardon of ſins. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he that truſts not in Chriſt truſts in himſelf, &amp;
muſt be tryed according to his truſt whereon he
leaneth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106078:4"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But yet it ſeemeth God is unjuſt in puniſhing
Chriſt, and us alſo.</p>
            <p>A. Not ſo: for Chriſt did not ſuffer for any ſuch
end, as to free us from puniſhment without faith in
him: but that thoſe that believe might be ſaved <hi>Ioh.</hi>
3. 16. and the reſt left without excuſe Ioh. 12. 47.
48. which could not be if he had not ſuffered the
puniſhment due for the ſins of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But yet then it ſeemes that Chriſt ſuffered in
vaine.</p>
            <p>A. Not ſo: for in that thoſe that believe in him
are ſaved, and thoſe that believe not have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
to make for themſelves why they believe not
in him, therefore he ſuffered not in vaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Could not Chriſt have effected, that all ſhould have
believed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He could if he would, but his ſuffering for all
doth not neceſſarily enforce that he muſt worke
faith in all, he was free in the giving of himſelf to
ſuffer. Ioh. 10. 18. and he is free alſo in quickning
the ſoules of whom he will Ioh. 5. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Why doth Chriſt ſay Math. 23. 37. How oft
would <hi>J</hi> have gathered thy children together, and ye
would not.</p>
            <p>A. It was not to ſhew that any thing was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or too hard for Chriſt to do, but only to ſhew
the averſnes of thoſe people to the means of grace
afforded.</p>
            <p>Q. Shall every one that believeth in Chriſt be ſaved?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106078:5"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea ſurely, for ſo it is writren <hi>Iohn 3. 16. Acts</hi>
16. 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is that thing that is to be believed by all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That which Chriſt hath commanded to be
preached to all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is that?</p>
            <p>A. The Goſpell which is glad tydings of good
things, <hi>Mar. 16. 15. Rom.</hi> 10. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Q. VVhat are thoſe glad tydings?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Peace and remiſſion of ſins by Chriſt, <hi>Rom:</hi> 10

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Ought al men to believe remiſſion of ſins in Chriſt?</p>
            <p>A. Yea ſurely, in as much as Chriſt hath required
remiſſion of ſins to be preached to all in his name,
and nothing is required of any to be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of that remiſſion but only faith to believe it,

               <hi>Q.</hi> Are all mens ſins then remitted in Chriſt, as a
truth to be preached to, and to be obſerved by al though
men be not yet believers.</p>
            <p>A, Not ſo, but the matter and meanes of remiſſion
of ſins is true in Chriſt for all, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 2. but then
only formally remitted when the former truth is
preached in the name of Chriſt and believed, <hi>John</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Ought men to believe that their ſins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
yea or no?</p>
            <p>A. Yea, <hi>John</hi> 11. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106078:5"/>
Q. But ought we not to believe that our ſins are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by a direct Act of faith, in Chriſt, or ought wee to
reflect upon our faith for the ground of our beliefe in
that particular?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not the latter, but the former, becauſe by the
ſame Faith by which Chriſt is underſtood to be
the meanes of the remiſſion of ſins, by the ſame he
is underſtood to be ſuch an effectuall meanes as
nothing is needfull to be added thereto; ſeeing
his death is our life, for by his ſtripes we are heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. and he that doth truly believe, that
Chriſt God man hath ſuffered for his ſins, cannot
but believe, that his ſins are pardoned, and that he
ſhall not ſuffer for them: as on the other ſide it is
impoſſible that any ſhould groundedly believe the
the latter, that doth not upon true grounds believe
the former.</p>
            <p>Q. Ought all to believe, that all ſins are pardoned
paſt, preſent and to come?</p>
            <p>A. Yea, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. 22. &amp; 2. 13. 14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2, 13
14. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22. 23.</p>
            <p>Q. Why then doth Chriſt teach us to pray, forgive us
our ſins?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe forgivenes of ſins is by faith in Chriſt,
and though all ought, yet all doe not believe in
Chriſt; and thoſe that do, do not ſo fully believe
as they ought, and therefore ought to pray, that
God would give and increaſe in us the believing
in Chriſt the forgivneſſe of ſins, and remove from

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Yea ſurely, for God doth rebuke, chaſtiſe, and
judge them for it, with temporall judgments, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them therby as his children to mortify the ſin
that remaineth in them, keeping them by this

            <p>A. Yes and of all unbelievers too: as a truth to be

            <p>Q. Is not the ſinne of unbeliefe waſhed away in the

            <p>A. Yes as a truth to be believed or elſe believers
themſelves could have no certainty of Salvation.</p>
            <p>Q. Why then are not all ſaved?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe they that believe not have no part in
Chriſt nor his ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Q. But are not the ſins of believers waſhed away other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

<hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 24. but not ſo, but that as yet they
need mortification: and in that reſpect are ſubject
to rebuke, chaſtiſement, &amp; temporall Iudgements
as meanes to help them therein. 1. <hi>Cor. 11. 22. Heb.</hi>
12. 5. 10. 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 19. which the glorified Saints
need not.</p>
            <p>Q. But whether doth God in theſe rebukes, chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and temporall Iudgements exerciſed upon his
Saints intend therein the ſatisfaction of juſtice by that
meanes?</p>
            <p>A. Not ſo, for that is ſatisfied in Chriſts ſufferings
which they partake of by faith effectually to the
juſtification of their perſons from condemnation,
but not for the juſtification of their evill actions
which God doth as much diſlike, and is diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with in his own people as in others, and doth
in love to their perſons ſhew and manifeſt his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
againſt thoſe evil actions, by chaſtiſments

more then in others.</p>
            <p>Q. Hath Chriſt then ſuffered for all the ſins of all
though they be unbelievers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes ſurely, and that doth appeare: Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

9. &amp; 9. 26. 1. <hi>John</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe Chriſt hath appointed remiſſion of

to all unbelievers, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 5. &amp; 24 47. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15
<hi>Ephe. 2 17. Act.</hi> 13: 38.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe elſe there is no meanes that an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
ſhould become a believer by: For <hi>how ſhall
they believe in him of whom they have not heard, Rom.</hi>
10. 14.</p>
            <p>4. Becauſe it is the greateſt ſin in an unbeliever,
not to believe that Chriſt hath ſuffered for all his
ſins. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. &amp; 12, 47. 48. &amp; 16 9 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8. &amp; 2.
10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 3. &amp; 10. 29. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <p>Ob. True it is, and may be granted, that Chriſt
ſuffered for all to procure an outward and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Some there be, that doe enioy no more then an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

becauſe they received not the love of the truth, by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Chriſt, that they might be ſaved, as the Scriptures
next before mentioned doe ſhew, with Luke 10. 11.
Acts 13. 46, Rom. 2. 4. 5. 2. Pet. 3.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, this overthrowes the office of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

if he ſuffered to procure an outward temporall benefit,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106078:7"/>

all doe enioy that though it be neither preached nor

            <p>
               <hi>Obi.</hi> But Chriſt ſaith, John. 17. 9. <hi>I</hi> pray not for the
world: Therefore ſurely he did not dye for the ſins of all
the world.</p>
            <p>A. Chriſts prayer is to be deſtinguiſhed in reſpect
of the thing prayed for (to wit) ſome things were
ſpeciall only belonging to the Saints, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with <hi>v.</hi> 11. 15. &amp; 17. and ſome things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all, and ſo for ſuch things Chriſt did pray
for the world as ver. 21 23. though not in reſpect
of the things in ſpeciall belonging only in peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to the Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I</hi> know that thou heareſt me
alwayes.</p>
            <p>A. True, and therfore Chriſt was hard in praying
for the world; for he only prayed for the unity of
the faithful, as a means tending to cauſe the world
to believe, as his ſuffering for all is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whether men believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it or not: And thus
the ſufferings of Chriſt and his prayer for all is of
equal extention, as a meanes tending to cauſe them
to believe, and if they do not, they are left without
excuſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But Chriſt ſaith, John 10. 15. <hi>I</hi> ſay downe my
life for my ſheep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106078:8"/>
A. True, &amp; ſo doth not the hireling, &amp; this is his
meaning in ſo ſaying, and not to exclude any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as ſuch for whom he hath not laid dwone his
life. Ob. <hi>It is ſaid</hi> Luke 1, 68, Mat 1. <hi>he hath redeemed
and ſhall ſave his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. In the old Teſtament Iſrael were in ſpecial cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his people, and ſo theſe places meane, the one
being ſpoken by <hi>Zachary,</hi> the other to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> both
Iſralites, for the comfort of that people in ſpeciall
in the time while that diſpenſation laſted, yet not
ſo then as to exclude others, as appears, <hi>Luk</hi> 2. 30.
31. 32. <hi>John 11. 50. 51. 52. Act 13. 46 47. Iſa.</hi> 49. 16.
therfore this hinders not, but that Chriſt ſuffered
for the ſins of all.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>It is ſaid</hi> Iſa. 53. 12. he bare the ſins of many:
Therefore not of all.</p>
            <p>A, It doth not follow, ſeeing many is oppoſed to a
few, not to all, as appeares in <hi>Rom</hi> 5. 19. by one
mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, that
is all: and alſo in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It is ſaid Ephe. 5. 25. Chriſt loved the Church
and gave himſelf for it: therefore not for all,</p>
            <p>A. It doth not follow, ſeeing Paul ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 6. he gave himſelf a ranſom for al: Therfore by
ſaying he gave himſelf for it, it is not to exclud any
for that were to make the Scripture to contradict
it ſelfe, but only to ſhew that the Church did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of ſuch love from Chriſt as a pattern to hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
towards their wives. And it may aſwell
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106078:8"/>
be concluded, becauſe Paul ſaid Chriſt, loved me
and gave himſelfe for me, that he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
for no other, as becauſe he loved the
Church, and gave himſelf for it: Therfore not for
all.</p>
            <p>Ob. But Chriſt ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 13. greater love
then this hath no man, when any man b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtoweth his life
for his friends: Therefore Chriſt ſuffered nor for the
ſinnes of all.</p>
            <p>A. <hi>It</hi> doth not follow, for ſuch love is found in Chriſt
to his enemies, Rom. 5. 10. Col. 1. 21. 22 Therefore
there is in Chriſt found greater love, then any that is
among men.</p>
            <p>Obi. But it is ſaid in Rev. 5. 9. &amp; 14. 3. 4 ſome
were redeemed from the Earth from among men:
Therefore he ſuffered not for the ſins of all.</p>
            <p>A. We muſt deſtinguiſh redemption in reſpect of
price, and in reſpect of the end and application:
Now the price is paid for all, <hi>Heb. 2. 9. 1 Tim.</hi> 2
6. And the end is. that perſons ſhould no longer
live to themſelves (as formerly they with others
the men of this world have done) but unto him
that hath paid the price for them, 2 Cor. 5. 15.
and this only they performe that have faith given
unto them, whereby they doe apply the benefit of
this price; in which latter reſpect they only are
ſaid to be redeemed: yet in reſpect of price, Chriſt
ſuffered for the ſinnes of all:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obi:</hi> But Chriſt doth not call all, for he ſaith Mat
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106078:9"/>
9. 13: <hi>I</hi> am not come to call the righteous, but ſinners to
Repentance: Therfore he ſuffered not for the ſins of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A:</hi> God admoniſheth all men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
<hi>Acts</hi> 17:30: and therfore Chriſt in ſaying, I
am not come to call the righteous, doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that any were righteous, and thereby ſuch as
were excluded from his call, but only this, that ſo
farre as any thought themſelves more righteous
then others, ſo farre forth they doe neceſſarily
exclude themſelves from the call of Chriſt more
then others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obi.</hi> But it ſeemes by. Rom. 5: 9: 10: that all that
Chriſt died for, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>A. Not ſo, neither doth Paul ſo intend, but only
that we have more manifeſt grounded reaſon to
believe ſalvation by him now he hath ſuffered for
us, then we had before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obi.</hi> But Paul ſaith Rom. 8. 32. he that ſpared
not his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how ſhall
he not with him freely give all things alſo: But God
doth not give all things freely unto all, univerſally:
therefore he ſuffered not for all.</p>
            <p>A. Al things are ſo inſeperably united unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
that unto whomſoever <hi>Chriſt is</hi> offered, all things
are offered with him, and whoſoever receiveth
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> receiveth all things with him, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 13. 20.
<hi>Mat:</hi> 10: 40: <hi>Luke</hi> 10: 16: 1 <hi>Tim 4 8. Mat.</hi> 6. 3.
and whoſoever denyeth or refuſeth Chriſt, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
all things with him, <hi>Lu.</hi> 12. 8. 9. &amp; 9: 26: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>

which only Chriſt properly becomes ours <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.
17. which God only gives to his elect, <hi>Tit. 1. 1. Ro.</hi>
8. 28. 29, 30. to them he gives with that faith, and
that Chriſt freely all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. but this
hinders not but that he ſuffered for all, though
faith, and Chriſt by faith, be not given to all: and
this appeares in that ſome for whom he is given
do deny him, 2. <hi>Pet. 2. 1. Mat. 21. 42. John</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But in Heb. 9. 13, 14 it is ſaid that the blood
of Chriſt doth more abundantly purge the conſcience,
then the blood of Buls and Goates did purifie the fleſh:
but the blood of Buls and Goates, and the aſhes of an
Heifer ſprinkling the uncleane ſanctified to the purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the fleſh: and all have not their conſciences pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the blood of Chriſt: Therefore he ſuffered not
for all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True it is, that the blood of Chriſt is of a
purging nature for all, but ſome tread it under
their feet and count it common or unholy, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 29. and do not by faith (as with a bunch of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop)
ſprinkle it upon the conſcience, and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
though they remain unclean ſtill: And ſo if the
beaſts were ſlain, yet unleſſe the blood were ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled
on the unclean, they would remain ſo in their
fleſh ſtil: Yet this hinders not, but that Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the ſins of all, that whoſoever beleeveth in
him being thereby purged, may be ſaved.</p>

it ſelf originally, and not from man, it muſt needs
therefore be attributed to God only, who propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
the diſpenſation thereof effectually accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own Decree of Election.</p>
            <p>Q. Ought every one to beleeve then that Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for all the ſins of all?</p>
            <p>A. Yea ſurely, or elſe how ſhall each perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
he ſuffered for their ſins?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But it ſeems incongreous, that one ſhould be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106078:11"/>
required to beleeve what Chriſt did for others?</p>
            <p>A. Not ſo, for if the benefit of Chriſts ſufferings
be to be preached unto others, it is then neceſſary
to beleeve what we preach for truth, to be truth,
and that to them to whom we preach the ſame.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, if there be nothing to diſtinguiſh
me from others, as the truth is, before faith ther is
not, then the queſtion is, if he have not ſuffered for
all, how ſhall I find that he ſuffered for me? But if
he hath ſuffered for all as the truth is he hath. <hi>Heb.</hi>
2. 9. then I beleeving that doe neceſſarily believe
that he ſuffered for me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But if this be ſaving faith to beleeve that
Ch<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſt ſuffered for all, then who is it but will be ſaved?
for all men will ſay<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that Chriſt ſuffered for all.</p>
            <p>A. Not ſo, for all that object to the contrary
do not ſay it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all that do ſay it, do not truly beleeve
it; and whoſoever do beleeve it, do neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that there is the matter of eternall death in
all, 2 Cor: 5: 14: and do neceſſarily beleeve an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
love extended to all, Iohn 3: 16: and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
thus beleeving will neceſſarily be conſtrained
to love God, and all things according to God, 2

               </gap>: and that is it that makes it moſt hard and
difficult to our nature, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7: 14: fooliſhnes to the

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106078:11"/>
who cannot endure, that the unlearned vitious
<hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots</hi> ſhould be free by the grace
offered in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 7: 39. &amp; 15: 2. by their
beleeving that Chriſt ſuffered for all, ſhould therby
only be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But it ſufficeth to ſaving faith, that Chriſt be
beleeved to be the Son of God, and was ſent and came
into the world to ſave ſinners indifinitely though not al?</p>
            <p>A Not ſo, if any be excluded: becauſe that takes
away certainty of faith from any in reſpect of
Chriſt, for if any be excluded, I may be the perſon
as ſoon as any other, and I have no ground to the
contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> may be certain if I beleeve?</p>
            <p>A. This is to make the foundation of faith to
ſtand in my beleeving, and not in Chriſt &amp; alſo to
make my firſt believing without any certain truth
to ground it ſelf upon, and is a ſuppoſition of an
impoſſiblity, (to wit) of a firme beleeving that
which cannot be known whether it be true or not:
wheras on the contrary it being a revealed truth,
that Chriſt did caſt death for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9.
each perſon hath a ground in that word of truth
to beleeve, that he dyed for him, and none hath
any excuſe that doth not beleeve it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> Is this then the ſubject matter of the Goſpel,
that Chriſt hath required to be preached to the
world: to wit, that Chriſt ſuffered for all the
ſinnes of al.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106078:12"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes ſurely, for without this no man hath any
thing to preach to the world, no Goſpell of glad tydings,
no remiſſion of ſins, no doctrin of reconciliation, no grace
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>peace at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be preached that Chriſt dyed for
beleivers,</p>
            <p>A. That is no glad tydings to the world, which do
not yet beleeve: neither wil ſuch a doctrine work
faith, whereas Chriſt hath appointed a Goſpel of
remiſſion of ſins by his death to be preached to the
world, to the begetting of perſons to the faith of
that truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. 17. &amp; 1. 16. &amp; 16. 26.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuch a doctrine doth ſuppoſe perſons
to be beleevers before Chriſt dyed for them, or at
leaſt before it may be preached unto them, that
Chriſt dyed for them, &amp; ſo by conſequence before
there be any thing to be beleeved: &amp; ſo by the ſame
conſequence impoſſible there ſhould be any belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>for how ſhall they beleeve on him of whom they
have not heard, Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But men muſt firſt feare God, or have ſome
work of God wrought in them, Acts 13. 26. before it
may be lawfull to preach the Goſpel to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A,</hi> Not ſo, for then it cannot be ſaid, that any are
<hi>begotten</hi> by preaching, if <hi>perſons</hi> muſt have a life &amp;
being in <hi>godlineſſe before:</hi> which is <hi>contrary to theſe
Scriptures, I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> 1. 23.</p>
            <p>Secondly, then it is unlawfull to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to all Nations, even to them that doe not feare
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106078:12"/>
God, which is contrary to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Mar:</hi>

50. and 17 32. and many other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the meaning of <hi>Acts</hi> 13: 26, is but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
the <hi>Proſelites</hi> from the naturall <hi>Iewes</hi> by
the appelation of fearing God: and when he ſaith,
<hi>to you,</hi> that is you Jews, both by nature &amp; religion,
<hi>to you</hi> in the firſt place accordiug to the commiſſion
of Chriſt, Luke 24 47. as therein offering mercy to
them, and they re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap>ſing the ſame, were left inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable:
as, ver. 40. 41, 45 46.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But how is it proved that the ſubject matter of
the Goſpel required to be preached to the world, is that
Chriſt ſuffered for the ſins of al?</p>
            <p>A. Firſt, becauſe Chriſt and the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
did ſo teach, <hi>Iſa: 53. 6. John</hi> 1: 29 &amp; 3. 16,
17: &amp; 6. 51 &amp; 12. 47. 48. 1 <hi>Cor: 153, 2 Cor.</hi> 5.
14, 15, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt required them ſo to preach, <hi>Mat:</hi>
28 18; 19: <hi>Mar: 16. 15. Luke</hi> 10. 5. &amp; 24. 47: <hi>Rom:</hi>
16. 26.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Saints are commended for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo, Iohn 4 44. 1 Iohn 4 14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe it is a condemning ſin in any
hearing the Goſpel not to beleeve ſo (to wit, that
Chriſt dyed for their ſins, Joh. 3. 18, 19 &amp; 12. 47,
48 &amp; 16: 9: 1 Iohn 5. 10:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But why is ſuch a doctri<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> required to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the world; to wit, that Chriſt ſuffered for all the

            <p>
               <pb n="02" facs="tcp:106078:13"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> For the working of the beleefe thereof in all,
in whom the doctrine prevaileth, and for the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſablenes
of the reſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15. 16 &amp; 4, 3. 4: &amp;
6. 1, 2. &amp; 10. 4, 5, 6. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8. &amp; 2. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> But will it not from hence follow, that man hath
free-will?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No ſurely, for if the Goſpel muſt work faith, then
it flowes not from the inclination of the will, but from
the Goſpels inlightning the under ſtanding, Epheſ. 4. 20:
23. Gal: 3. 2. Rom 1. 16, 17. &amp; 10: 17: and as for
the inexcuſablenes of the reſt which doe not beleive, it
doth not betoaken a freedome of wil to beleeve, but doth
bewray a blind mind, and an hard heart, and a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diſpoſition, that will not beleeve the truth, though
it be declared unto them, Acts 13. 41. Iohn 5. 40, 44.
Epheſ. 4: 18: Rom: 2: 7, 8, 9:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Have not all perſons a rebellious diſpoſition to the
beleeving of the Goſpell?</p>
            <p>A. Yes ſurely, untill the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
prevaile, and then, and by that meanes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
diſpoſition is caſt down &amp; ſubjected, and
the perſons brought unto the obedience of Chriſt,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. and when it prevailes not, it heaps up
vengeance againſt the diſobedient, ver. 6.</p>
            <p>Q. But hath God elected ſome perſons before the
world began, which only ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>A. Yea certainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. or elſe the events
of things in time ſhould come to paſſe, without or
by ſome other ordering cauſe then the councell &amp;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106078:13"/>
decree of God, which were impiety once to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
            <p>Q. But doth not the doctrine of Chriſts dying for all
contradict this doctrine?</p>
            <p>A. No ſurely, becauſe it is the means to worke
faith effectually in the Elect according to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
decree, 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 4, 5. Rom.</hi> 8. 30. and to leave
the other abſolutely inexcuſable in the effecting
their own deſtruction by their refuſal to beleeve in
the ſufferings of Chriſt preached and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſame eternall decree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. <hi>Iude</hi> 4.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33.</p>
            <p>Q. Why then it ſeems, that Chriſts ſuffering for all
the ſins of all ought freely to be preached to all, and not
to be limited by any conſideration of the doctrine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection?</p>
            <p>A. Surely that muſt needs be ſo, Firſt, becauſe it
is the Commiſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe we doe not know who is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
no otherwiſe then by the event.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe it is as true doctrine to them
that are not Elect, as to the Elect, whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it or not.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe God hath his end in Chriſts
ſuffering for the ſins of all, and in the doctrine
thereof to all as well when it is not beleeved, as
when it is beleeved, <hi>Luke 2. 34 1 Cor. 23 24 2 Cor:</hi>
2. 14, 15, 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Becauſe elſe it is not a direct meanes to
work faith in any at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:106078:14"/>
Sixtly, Becauſe elſe unbeleevers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are not by that
meanes left inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But if this be the doctrine and faith to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and beleeved, may it be concluded from hence, that
none have ſaving faith but thoſe that beleeve this
doctrine?</p>
            <p>A. It is certaine, there is no ſaving faith without
beleeving in the ſufferings of Chriſt; neither have
any true ground to beleeve that he ſuffered for
them any otherwiſe, then he is declared in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to have ſuffered for all; yet here we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh,
ſome do not ſo diſtinctly underſtand it
to build their faith upon it as others do, who ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have a weaker faith then others have: ye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
this is out of all doubt, that no ſaving faith ſtands
in oppoſition to it, though ſome perſons weak in
the faith poſſibly may<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome perſons who do appeare very godly doe
oppoſe it?</p>
            <p>A. True, but many perſons who do appear ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
godly are not ſo indeed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, many godly perſons are enemies to the
truth, and to themſelves too, <hi>Mat. 16. 22, 33. Mar.</hi>
8. 33.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuch oppoſition proceeds not from
their faith, but from their ignorance and ſinfull
corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> But may we ſafely beleeve that Chriſt
ſuffered for the ſinne of all, and ſo for us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106078:14"/>
our own Salvation, before we know whether we bee
elected or not?</p>
            <p>A. Yea ſurely, for ſo we are directed, <hi>Rom:</hi> 10. 6, 7,
8, 9. and yet nevertheleſſe by this call of God to
this knowledge &amp; beleife, we may be ſure that he
hath choſen us unto Salvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> True it is that the matter of our Iuſtification is
the blood of Chriſt ſhed for all, to be beleeved by all:

1. 12. &amp; 3. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 33. 36, &amp; 8. 24. &amp;
3. 11. 25. 36. &amp; 12, 46, 47. 48. Joh. 16. 9.</p>
            <p>Q. But are not the elect juſtified in the purpoſe of God
from all eternity?</p>
            <p>A. No more then they are called and glorified
from al eternity, and that is only predeſtinated and

Here we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the decree of

to do a thing, and the doing of the ſame
according to appointment: God did appoint for
to juſtifie his Elect in time, and when the time is
come, God doth accordingly effect the ſame by
giving them Faith, therby making them partakers
