            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I had erected a kinde of Inquiſition through the whole Land, and none dared ſo much to look ſtern upon the face of Epiſcopacy, (though they had been moſt eminent in all the graces of the Spirit) but preſently behoved to be cruſhed; I had ſo cunningly interlaced the Image of the Beaſt, with His Majeſties Pourtrait, that none durſt inveyagainſt the one, but preſently behoved to injure the other (thus caught within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of Treaſon,) by a ſtrange Divinity, aſſuring the world, that the Crown could not flouriſh on the Kings head, without the Fellowſhip of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; All my pretentions were deeply guilded with the Beams of Authority, which through Inadvertencie, and faſhion of Times, I made Uſher in ſuch ſtrangers, as deflored the Church, abuſed the State, and diſhonoured the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
            <p>When the ſeeds of Arminianiſme, Superſtition, and Popery, (by my Epiſcopall law more tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the honour of Hierarchy, then the Goſpels integritie) ſimplicity had been very Luxuriant, and over-run the whole Vineyard, I knew that as <hi>Rome</hi> was now filled with joy, for the fair hopes of our return to her, ſo was <hi>England,</hi> and all the Churches reformed choakt with fear and ſorrow; For alas, even as the Earth looks ſad, and ſullen, at the Sunnes departure, and every Tree, every flower puts forth a tear when he renews his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Why do not we conceive the lovers of the Spirit of truth, muſt be diſmayed, wounded in heart, and cloathed in ſorrow when truth is baniſht from out the face of the Earth. Yet would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94271:6"/>
I never make ſcruple (out of zeal to that Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Monarchy) to tread down all thoſe who were bold to ſpeak againſt the calamities of Times, iniquities of the Times, and the injuiries done to the Goſpel, though we muſt all confeſſe the Spirit of Truth, did powerfully dwell in them. I ſuppreſſed them, removed them, and ſend them in baniſhment beyond Sea, thereby depriving Church and Common-wealth of their Chriſtian help, both in Religion, and Policy; But my own Creatures, willing Inſtruments to promote my Counſells, and Projects, were moſt ſolemnly advanced to the places in Church and State. Thus We went on, kept our correſpondence, and ordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our game by ſuch a ſtrange cunning, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that there remains a black Hiſtory for our deeds, which will hardly meet with belief in other Churches.</p>
            <p>By the whole Current of my carriage, by my practiſes, wayes, motions, and intelligence ye knew, alas, that I was about that great work of the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> (in ſuch ſort that ſome of the Pasquils of the time have Charactered me Her laborious Pander) to make the poſſeſſion of World Hers, and derogate from the glory of the Goſpel, and honour of Kings. O be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for ſo miſerably proſtituting your ſelves, and your ſouls to the domineering pride of my humor, in fomenting my Popiſh intentions, conſtantly followed by you, as if we had joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſpired to the overthrow of Truth and Religion.</p>

And becauſe the Printers Preſſe did often ſpeake the times, and tell the world the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of my Epiſcopiſing, therefore did I arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to my ſelfe the keys thereof, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the power of Printing depend on me, did ſhut and open the ſame at my pleaſure. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durſt any booke though never ſo richly embelliſht with the treaſures of piety and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome once appeare, untill by a ſupercillious licenſe my Canonicke Secretaries had firſt found it reliſh deeply of the Romiſh and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian poyſon. And as I was the rule of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, intending and remitting the qualities of Sermons, as the conditions of times required, So were many Pulpits prophaned with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Revilings, and Scurrilous reproches; Nay, wherein have I reſtrained my inſolent, and unbridled minde in the purſuit of my ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious follies? What Statute Civill or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall cannot riſe up againſt mee, and argue guilty? To ſhew how I have framed new Conſtitutions, Ceremonies without number, which infeſt the world daily more and more, Canons, and Articles, and Oaths, printed, publiſhed, and forced upon the people? How wee have dared to grant Licenſes, and make preſumptuous Diſpenſations?

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94271:7"/>
of the upright creature by terrible things, in Righteouſneſſe; for I know the end of your hopes, and gave expanſion to my ſoule to ſeek the things of this world, and not of God, but now, behold, I ſtand upon the ſtage of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity like an accurſed tree, the miſerable object of this age, groan under the hatred of three Kingdomes, able to cruſh all the Miters in <hi>England,</hi> ready to be teared by the wrath of mine Enemies, who ſharpe their eyes againſt mee.</p>
            <p>Not content with that abſolute Power which the errour and conſuetude of Times, and the indulgence of Princes (importuned with reſtleſſe ambition) ſuffered to fall upon mee heere in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, I would needes dilate my ſelfe like a ſwolne cloud of infection, to obſcure the light, to poyſon the aire, and to trouble the calme, and ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of other Kingdomes; I could not endure that other Churches ſhould looke grievouſly, and a ſquint upon our manner of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For I muſt confeſſe, my intentions were deepe and large, againſt all the reformed Churches, and Reformation of Religion, which through his Majeſties Dominions I had wounded to the very ſoul, ſo that it lay grove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and panting on the ground ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, if I had not been removed, and our plots detected to the glory of God, to the honour of King and Parliament, to the terrour of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94271:8"/>
the wicked, and comfort of all thoſe who have bin labouring after the beauty of theſe times, and would have bought theſe acceptable days with many thouſands.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, I made the firſt aſſault on the weakneſſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (as in my light eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I conceived, but was deſtitute of the Spirit of Prophecie) and cauſed to be compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Service booke for their devotion, obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſame upon their Church, which I knew the tenderneſs of their conſcience could no ways endure; yet by my owne counſell I was caſt down; for though I knew well it was nothing elſe but a ſtrange Rhapſody of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean things and unſavoury, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> once received in the bowels of Church or State, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give reſt, till like a virulent poyſon it had begotten inteſtine warre in the body Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and Civill. I knew likewayes it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the foundation the order of their Church, making a large entry to all Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to come, being repugnant to the Doctrine, Diſcipline, and order of their Reformation, to their Confeſſion of Faith, Conſtitutions of their Generall Aſſemblies, and Acts of their Parliament eſtabliſhing true Religion; yet would I needs enforce that booke upon a Nation, which ſooner would have welcomed the Plague, the Famine, and the Sword. Hence did ſpring this terrible combuſtion, (which I feare ſhall no other wayes be quenched, then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94271:8"/>
by the bloud of that faction which cauſed the ſame) now threatning with open mouth, and implacable fury to devoure us all; When the Scots affrighted with ſuch an unknown Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had in moſt humble manner proſtrate themſelvs to authority, and craved a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from that impreſtable obedience, not able to drinke that poyſon which I had ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſly preſented to them, as if Supreame Majeſty had been violated, Monarchy affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and a Royall Prerogative many wayes injured, I armed Authority againſt them, and made ſuch ſtrange pretences, diſſembling a Zeale to the honour of the Crowne (which meane while I was trampling under-foote) that any thing behoved to bee done, all the Treaſures of Revenge were to be waſted, before his Majeſties command did not meete with full obedience; but the ſuggeſtions and motions were ever mine, moſt palpably to blow up all, and involve all in conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>All the Supplications (both pious and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent) the Declarations, Informations, and Reformations (to which none of us could ever reply) of that afflicted Nation, I cauſed to bee ſuppreſſed moſt diligently (not able to ſtand before ſuch a Light, and fearing they ſhould work the overthrow of our cauſe) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them to bee anſwered, with terrible Proclamations. And when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94271:9"/>
to uſe the remedy of proteſtation, without any ſcruple or tryall of the buſines, (like an undiſtinguiſhing fire that delights to feed it ſelf by embracing all Objects) I cauſed them bee declared and publiſhed, in all the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> Traitors, and Rebells; And laſtly when they were ſeeking to poſſeſſe their Religion againſt my ſtrange devices, and Novations, I Kindled the fatall warre, and rather then I ſhould fall from my counſels, and have any of my intentions caſt back on my face, <hi>I</hi> choſed to cover the whole Iſland with bloud.</p>
            <p>And therefore having once eſpouſed the <hi>Roman</hi> quarrell, I cauſed diſplay an open ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and muſtered my forces, called forth my Squadrons (as if religion, and the honour Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all had been lying at the ſtake) and ſet forth an Epiſcopall Expedition for defence of the Mitre, which in end will be covered with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes in deſpight of all created powers. But ô yee of little providence, for what all this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Where were your ſouls? And why did none of us foreſee the black ſucceſſe of ſuch deſtructive, diſtempers, and unmercifull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities? But this was our houre, our very houre, wherein wee were wiſe to our owne deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Thus when by our working the Land was divided in two Armies, advanced and brought in view of each other, yet not ſo much as a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94271:9"/>
Dog to offend; When all matters were ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſed, and by a Pacification as unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired as unexpected of us both Nations had comforted themſelves with the hopes of peace and quietneſſe, then like an angry wind that layes bare the very ocean, or like fire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, I burſt forth and ſpred my ſelf with greater violence, and could not give reſt to my mind, till a new war was kindled, and all things for their deſtruction with a freſher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution then before prepared againſt them. How I beſtirred by ſelf both at the Counſell Table, and privy Juncto, to reproach all his Majeſties Royall intentions of peace with his Subjects, and that Pacification as diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and fit to be broken, yee can all beare mee record. I controlled the judgement of the whole Kingdome and Parliament. And though they found no juſt reaſon and emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie for warre, yet becauſe I apprehended our Kingdome was like to make a fatall end, and our Babel was trembling, ready to tumble down about our eares, and that there was no ſafety left but to build upon the ruines of their confuſion, Therefore in politick probability I thought it moſt fit to ſhake all, and put all in diviſions and diſorders, that ſo wee might work our owne ſafety, and the redemption of Hierarchy from the publike reproach, fiſhing in troubled waters: Thus in my graceleſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, I concluded it good counſell to bring
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94271:10"/>
both Kingdomes neerer to ruine, that being made poore and paſsive, they might be ruled with the more eaſe.</p>
            <p>It is not unknown to you all how impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and blaſphemouſly I railed againſt that Covenant of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (which like a terrible Spear in the hand of the mighty has ſtricke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us through the very ſoul, &amp; muſt triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph through the world, to the aboliſhing of that great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, if wee obſerve the indeniable finger of a Providence) though it was moſt true that the ſame did containe nothing but the marrow of Religion, was approved by Nationall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, ſubſcribed by his Majeſties Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, &amp; by the Lords of his Majeſties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and by them commanded to be ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by all the Subjects of that Kingdome, as a teſtimony of their duty to God &amp; the King. Though the beautiful face of Religion which did ſhine there moſt gloriouſly, and all theſe warrants in a morall way could have juſtified them, and taught mee better manners, yet I would break through all conſiderations, and make good my miſtake, uſing that power whereof I was in poſſeſsion to the effectuall embracements of my owne wiſhes. As they uſed all means to approve themſelves to God and Man, and deliver unto their Poſteritie the true Religion in her purity and majeſty, So I profeſſe my ſtudy was to render them odious, charging with unqueſtioned guilt theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94271:10"/>
that endeavoured to gain his Majeſties favour and were moſt faithfull to his Crown, and dignity.</p>
            <p>When the Parliament could not bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to diſcend into warre againſt a Nation, maintaining their Religion, and Liberties, I did impede their procedings, and ſtop their Reſolutions, as if they had met for no other purpoſe, then to give up their Judgements to mee, and evidence their devotion to my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ends. And not only did I adviſe the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of that high and honourable Court of Parliament, (on which all the Eys of <hi>Europe</hi> were faſtned, and whence the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches expected refreſhment) but did like-ways ſit ſtill in the Convocation houſe, making Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Conſtitutions: Ordaining under all higheſt paines, that hereafter the Clergy ſhould preach foure times in the yeere ſuch Doctrines as were contrary not only to the Scottiſh proceedings, but to the Doctrines and proceedings of other Churches, to the Judgement of all ſound Divines, and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and tending to the utter ſlavery, and ruining of all Eſtates, and Kingdomes, and to the diſhonour of Kings, and Monarchs. Not content herewith, I procured ſix Subſidies to be levied of the Clergie, under pain of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation to al who ſhould refuſe for this great exigency, and Holy war. And as if all theſe had not been ſufficient (O hide your faces, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94271:11"/>
bluſh for ſhame) I cauſed frame and print a Prayer, and ſent through all the pariſhes of <hi>England,</hi> to be ſaid in time of divine Service, againſt that Nation by the name of traiterous Subjects having caſt off all obedience to their anointed Soveraigne, and comming in a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious manner to invade <hi>England,</hi> that ſhame might cover their faces, as enemies to God and the King.

            <p>Many ſtrange oaths I invented preſſing them upon the paine of impriſonment and huge pecuniall mulets. And in that ſacred Synod (as wee called it, but God is not mocked) was that love-lock of Antichriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that prodigious that bottomleſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited oath coined, which was provided moſt prudently as bonds and chaines to ty the laity from invading our liberties which wee conceived to be powerfully fortified with our imperiors Canons as a Rampard: So that if the wiſdome of the State, in the great counſell and ſupreame Senate of the Kingdome, ſhould think fit to alter any thing hereafter in the government of the Church, we gloried in this as a Maſter-piece of providence, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate and foreſtall their judgement by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94271:11"/>
them ſweare before hand to damnable hereſies (for why ſhould I now diſſemble) That the government of Archbiſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Deacons, &amp;c. (A ſtrange miſhap in Monſter with a Dragons taile, not ſprung from Scripture,) is <hi>jure divino,</hi> and that they ſhould never give conſent to any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. This was a heavie yoke, and ſtrong fetters caſt upon Chriſtian liberty. Yee all know what meanes wee uſed in that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave to make all ſure againſt the ſtorme that threatned us: for the motive of our mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was not the peace and purity of the Church, (nay, we threw oile in the flame) nor the extirping of hereſies, (for day after day they ſet up their abominable heads, and came forth as Locuſts out of the pit) and eſtabliſhing the truth, in the power of doctrine and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; but to aſſure our Epiſcopacie, and exalt Hierarchie, which was now fainting and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing under the weight of ſo many reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ready to expire. If we dare not for the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of theſe Canons, appeare before that powerfull Sun-beame (the Eſtates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) which doth melt us like Snow, and make us aſhamed like Bats and Owls, where ſhall we ſtand for their impietie in the great day of our reckoning.</p>

decreaſing of our glory, and the advancements of our enemies, ſince that great yeere 1640 (which by after ages ſhall be obſerved as the times of <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> confuſion) That the Lord has beene with them wonderfully, that wee have beene deſerted in every particular, and tumbling from a precipice day by day, ſo that it were madneſſe to thinke wee ſhall recover our game, or attain to the tops of the Mountains from whence wee are falne: This aſsiſtance, and the very time of the beginning of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is obſerved by the more curious to have been promiſed, as it were, and intimated in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2. in theſe.

Nay, though we ſhould uſe all nature and art to cement the ſame, it ſhall not avail, it ſhall not proſper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the finger of God is againſt us.</p>
            <p>Wee need not ſtraine arguments afarre, to bring this home to your indocile ſoules, and poſſeſſe you with this aſſurance, that there is a great work begun which ſhall be conſummate

with glory, to the joy of the friends of the Goſpell, and utter confuſion of the enemies of Peace and Truth; and that in the Church of <hi>England</hi> likewayes, there is certainly a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to be looked for, as in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which has (to the great emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the diſ-heartned people here, in this houre of hope, promiſing to themſelves a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain relief) ſo reſtored Religion and Truth to their ſplendour and purity (through the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular finger of God) that this day it is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the deſires, and the height of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, of all diſtreſſed Churches to be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the comforts of ſuch a Reformation as they now enjoy.</p>
            <p>If the purpoſe of God by the condition of theſe times, and this ſtrange working, be not manifeſted to you, adviſe with Politike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability (yee that are Jeſuited Statiſts) and behold how every thing ſtrugles for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. The winds are let looſe from all the corners of the earth, and ſpread themſelves furiouſly: All mens affections decay almoſt, and are looſed to the Leaders of that great cauſe, for which we have poured out our ſouls (but unprofitably as waters ſpilt on the ground). For though to the gloriation of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts (which they have openly, and inſolently declared in print) the face of our Church was changed, and the language thereof altered, yet now conſider the temper of mens minds,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94271:19"/>
the ſtrength of their wiſhes, and power of their affection. Nothing but univerſall deteſtation, and averſeneſſe from us, and our wayes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an inclination well followed, with the maturity of times, to the contrary in all points. For the people, like a field of ſtanding corne moved by a ſtiffe gale, do all bow their heads one way, or like a ſtrong tyde chaſed by the winde do all make but one current.</p>
            <p>There is likeways a certain quickning, and agitation, and expectation in the ſpirits of men, to believe, and hope for the beauty of Reformation, and our utter removall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they have been (no queſtion) effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally praying, and of late in an extraordinary manner, reporting the comfort of a ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. Now tell me if yee conceive it poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſo great a work, ſo eminently aſsiſted by him who holds the ends of the world in his hands, can be deſerted, but that it ſhall be crowned with the Copeſtone, elſe they had loſed their prayers, and the ſtrength of their wit, by which wee confeſſe they prevaile, for Hee that is the God of their Covenant mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on like a man of war, and wil notſtay, till the Antichriſt be puld down, and his Enemies be made his footſtool, and the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> call'd in.

With us and our faction, nothing but a benummed ſullenneſſe, and a profound ſilence; We are all given over to the ſpirit of ſlumber; Our pens are plagued with a lethargie, Though your Prelacie be now lying gaſping, yet there is none almoſt that dare owne it, not any to encounter thoſe papers which come forth in Squadrons, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the Banner of Truth, to captivate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very underſtanding, and will, to the obedience thereof. Lay your hands on your mouth: for we are not all able to reſtore that Monſter to its wonted dignity, and height of power, nor fetch its pedigree from Heaven, or ſhew how the ſame ought to bee welcommed in the World, or can be uſefull, and expedient in a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Republike: no we ſhould fail, though wee concentrat our wits, and alambique our ſpirits. There is one, indeed, who hath affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his underſtanding, and wearied his pen in the defence thereof, and now of late, with a new aſſault, tendred his Remonſtrance to the Parliament, humbly entreating the Honorable Court, to let the poor, miſerable, torn thing,

breath a while, but alas, thinke not that noble Senate (to whoſe wiſdome all <hi>Europe</hi> doe pay their tributary gazes) will any longer nouriſh ſuch Snakes, &amp; keep Serpents in their boſome, for it cannot be but they muſt reſent their ſmarts, and think wee have ſting'd them with a dangerous poyſon, which has mortally defiled all the veines of the Politicke and Eccleſiaſticke body. How ready mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is to any thing, which can give warrant, or coloured pretence to his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, may well appeare by his liveleſſe Apologie, wherein his Arguments are not ſo much Chriſtian, as wreſted from Antiquity. Yet yee that are the Fathers of the Church might well know, it was not ſo from the beginning, Truth did precede erroar, and drive the point home to the Source, it ſhall be cleere. Antiquity is no patrociny for errour, and preſcription no prejudice to Truth, his reaſons doe as much befriend the Romiſh Hierarchy as militate for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and much more eaſie it is to anſwer them, then to find them out.</p>
            <p>But I pray you why doe not we follow the ſafeſt way, moſt free of Ceremonies and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Which among us can reproach all this while the Government of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Church? And dare wee deny but it is moſt agreeable to the ſimplicity of the Goſpell? And a ſurer Rampard againſt the prevalencie of Herefies?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94271:20"/>
whether of the governments, their Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or our ſplendide, and magnifick Orders are more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſonant to the Apoſtolike &amp; Primitive, and leaſt approaching to the Romiſh? What Office-bearers among them, which ye find not in the Scriptures? Or any preheminence, and relation, of a Miniſter to a Miniſter, being both of one degree? Nay, give over the game which muſt be loſt, yee know if the Antichriſt muſt fall that we can hardly ſtand; If the Ocean be dryed up, whence ſhall the Rivers come?</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but'wee have moved ſwiftly and boldly. And to ſay wee have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing advanced to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; forſaken the cleer waters of the Goſpell, evaporated, and diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the powers of Religion, it were an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence beyond wonder, which all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches would caſt back on our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with ſhame. Nay, wee have dethroned Truth, and builded Altars to Errour and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, chaſing Chriſt out of the Church, and making an holy place for Antichriſt; from Kings likewayes have we wreſted Authority, torn the Crowne, and adorned the Mitre, in ſuch ſort that the God of all the World may well ſay, We have reigned, but not by him, Wee have made our ſelves Princes, but hee knew it not. If it be not ſo, what then means the lowing of the Oxen, and the bleating of the Sheep? Whence the huge number of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies?

For it is very unbeſeeming the people of God to ſymbolize with Idolaters, and the Enemies of God, (whether in their manner of worſhip or government) where there is no neceſſity. The <hi>Jews</hi> would not ſpeak though it were but half the ſpeech of <hi>Aſhod.</hi> And when the world crys out againſt us, charging our profeſsion with theſe great diſhonours done to the Name of God, wee have no other hole to creep in, nor any better anſwer to return, then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have for avoiding the ſtain of that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which this day cuts the hearts of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Reformed Churches. Now, to think that the Truth ſhall ever be born downe, and not once ſet up his victorious head, Nay, in this ſame Article of Time, wherein it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch ſtrength, and power, and Majeſty, and hath diſperſed the clouds, which wee of a long while have been diligently aſſembling, were egregiouſly to be infatuate, and if yee continue to let theſe hopes ſmile upon you ye are certainly finally demented, and fitted to perdition, examples and fore-runners of that great wrath, appointed for thoſe who had their eyes upon our returns, and expected the propagation of their Kingdome from us.</p>
            <p>But if all other things ſhould hold their

peace (ye that are witneſſes to this great refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and upon whom theſe happy dayes have falne) hear how this late Covenant doth cry aloud; even this great Covenant, ſworne, and ſealed ſo ſolemnly. Do not yee ſee how they hold out their arms to embrace it, and think they have found a Sovereigne balme for all the wounds in Church &amp; State, if happily applyed? Have they not hereby as it were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Sacrament for our deſtruction? What leſſe things can bee expected then from the Covenant of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which as it hath filled the earth with the noiſe thereof, and made the Altars of <hi>Rome</hi> to tremble for fear, ſo now likewayes has proved a dangerous precedent, and a ſtrange leading caſe for our compleat raine? Of what ſtrange productions can this be the fore-runner? Are all theſe motions, theſe ſolemnities of new reſolutions, to which the people have ſo willingly eſpouſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to no purpoſe? Can all this be for the upholding of our Kingdome? Or do not yee rather perceive a ſtreaming Banner diſplayed againſt you? Have not they combined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with immovable thoughts, to extirpate all unneceſſary follies, and novations which are the very ſoul of our glory, and the beams of our ſplendour? Have they not cut our haires wherein our ſtrength does lie, made us bald, and diſcovered our ſhame, and who may
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94271:22"/>
not invade us ſecurely? No, no, do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain theſe great appearances; from the root of this Covenant ſhall ſpring a Tree whoſe top ſhall reach the Heaven, and under the branches thereof ſhall the Nations of the earth hide themſelves; it ſhal increaſe and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh as the goodly Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> but our contemptible plant, which the heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath not planted, ſhall be pulled up, and die. Tell me, yee that can diſcern the face of the weather, and pretend to know the times and ſeaſons, doth not every day looke more blacke and ugly? What kindneſſe have wee found of God, or what conqueſt of friends have wee made amongſt men, ſince the times began to be ſhaken? Doth not every day pull a feather from our wings, by which wee uſed to worke ſo high, till the vapours of the earth could not reach us? <hi>Quae nos dementia coepit</hi> to think we ſhall ever recover of theſe wounds already inflicted, ſince the arrows are daily multiplyed, and fall on us in ſhowres from all hands; Wee have ſtrained our moyen at the Courts of Princes, but they be now juſtly wearied of us: And hee is reputed neither good Chriſtian, nor underſtanding Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, neither pious, nor politike, that dare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth for us. And if wee ſhall lift up our eyes to Heaven, behold, Wee cannot ſay there be more for us, then againſt us, Wee can
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94271:22"/>
meet with no conſolation, but a devouring ſword drawne againſt the children of Pride. What Giant plots we have ſet afoot, and how inſeasonably they are diſcovered, to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſhame, it is now ſpred like the Suns light. And though hitherto there were ſome hopes left, yet now they are all blaſted, and wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſtink in the eyes of our boſome friends. Our purpoſes are unvailed, our intentions, blacke as darkneſſe, are now made known, and howbeit wee could have joyed before in ſome of the peoples good graces, yet theſe horrible deſignes, of advocating ſtrange aſsiſtance, of ſoliciting and covenanting with Papiſts, of forcing and beſieging the very Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and doing violence to the whole Kingdome, for upholding our Grandours, for keeping our venerable Garlands upon our heads, are indeed Acts able to draw the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable weight of publike hate upon us, and which might as deſervedly procure us to be caſt out of the Church and State, as ever the Jeſuits were turned out of <hi>France,</hi> and are to this day baniſhed from the <hi>Venetian</hi> Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
            <p>Nor let us any more evaniſh in this deceit, to think wee can move Authority to lend us a gracious hand, and keep us from ſinking: for though the favours wee have found be great, and a mercifull Majeſty hath done much, yet now (it is to be feared) hee will relinquiſh us,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94271:23"/>
and not undoe his State Civill, for upholding the Eccleſiaſtick in Accidentals. And when Heaven and Earth combine againſt us, and the preſent eſtate of affairs deny help, and refuſe hope, Whether ſhall wee flie? There is no balme in <hi>Gilead</hi> now; Take heed, The windes are blowing, the flouds are comming, and our thunder-ſtricken building muſt down, becauſe not of God.</p>
            <p>Wee have already received ſentence from the Honourable Houſe of Commons; their wiſdome and juſtice have pronounced the peoples minde, and denounced the Kingdoms pleaſure; And though the influence of ſome frolick faction (now fugitive as our hopes are) ſhould yet a little prolong the life of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and entertain us with a poſsibility of wreſtling thorow, Tell me if ever any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did thrive being once co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by them? It is certainly a great loſſe, not to have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments affection, and very hard (as they ſay) to fit in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſtrive againſt the Pope. No, no, Nature and Grace, Time and Fortune, have taken ſuch a good courſe to deſtroy us, that it is impoſsible wee can be ſaved without a miracle.</p>
            <p>Far, far be it from us to think our contracted, and long accuſtomed boldneſſe, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, can any more enveigle the eyes of the World, with that Idoll of Jealouſie, which by the corruption of times, through the ambition

of mans unlimited heart, is now exalted to ſuch exorbitancie of height, that become top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heavy, it fals with its own weight. O then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, In the bowels of mercy depart from that willingly, which as you are now deſerted of men, will once make you rejected of God. What is it (alas) to be covered with a Princes wings, to be warmed with the beams of his favour, to be ſet up as it were on a Pyramide, and made the object of wonder, to have ſuch ſway, that with the one foot ye may tread on the Church, with the other cruſh the State, and ſo to monopolize all power, that without you there is nothing but <hi>ſimulachrum poteſtatis?</hi> What is it I ſay, all this? Is God mocked? Can yee elude the thunderbolts of his anger? Can yee be lift up beyond the ſtroake of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? Can yee give laws to the Spirit of the moſt high, to mould the times in what faſhion pleaſeth you? Be there not certain fatall peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, as of Houſes, Families, &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weals, ſo likeways a viciſsitude of governments? In many other places has Epiſcopacie been caſt out, neither ever could the face of Church or Common-wealth look calme, till that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> was thrown in the Sea. And in this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of time, when all things ſmile on them, but frown upon us, nothing more eaſie, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more abſurd, than to flatter our ſelves with contrary expectations.</p>
            <p>O that I knew what way to induce you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94271:24"/>
powerfully, to contemne that, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted of God, hatefull to men, odious to the times, hurtfull to the Church, &amp; in the end wil bring a dire deſtruction upon your ſelves. Would yee have ſignes from Heaven? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how all the inventions of our ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated policies, aſsiſted by the powers of the time, have failed us very wonderfully, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular, and turned upon our own pates; Looke to the continuall progreſſe of our affairs, how all the machinations which wee conceived were ſufficiently able, to ripen and produce our deſignes, have proved ſteps to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our enemies (The great chaſtiſers of the times) and that we have reaped nothing of all our pains and expenſes, but ſad diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to our ſelves, and confuſion to our cauſe.</p>
            <p>Put off therefore theſe vain and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſires, which are of the World, and die with the world. The fooliſh Grandour of your Lordly dignities, is but a dream and toy of ſome few decrepit yeeres, which flowne over, will make all the veins of your heart to ſhake, 'Tis but a ſhadow, in the morning with you, at night behind you, paſt and gone.</p>
            <p>But now the inexorable meſſenger of death approacheth furiouſly, and charges mee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, The impatient world chaſeth me away, and I muſt be gone: I take therefore Heaven and Earth to witneſſe againſt you, that I have

               </gap>ll from the ſword of Juſtice, adviſing you as yee would eſchew the wrath to come, and be delivered from the worlds anger, no longer to reſiſt the Spirit, which prompts the times ſo powerfully, to ſolicit the embracements of the Whore, and by the continuall encreaſe of miſeries, to expoſe the Church &amp; Kingdom, to be a ſpectacle of pitie &amp; laughter to Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches, and Common-weals. And if yee will not forſake your wayes, lay downe your Antichriſtian Offices at the foot of the Church, which ye have ſo miſerably torne, If you will not divorce your ſelves, from the luſts of that abominable preheminence, and be ſtrongly devoted to the advancements of this happy Reformation, which moves ſo ſweetly towards the end of Propheſies, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the glorious light of ſalvation, and encouragement of Gods people, I declare in audience of the World, that wrath ſhall come and fall upon your necks as Thunder from the Clouds, yee ſhall die and none lament it.</p>
            <p>Thus have I acquit my ſelfe: for the ſpirit within me conſtrained me. I muſt depart, and reſigne my chair, never to be fill'd again. Have pity upon me my friends, for the hand of the Lord is upon me.</p>
