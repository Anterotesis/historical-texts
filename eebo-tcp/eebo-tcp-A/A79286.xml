         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince it hath pleaſed the Divine Providence in ſo wonderful a manner, and by ways and means no leſs miraculous, then thoſe by which he did, heretofore, preſerve and reſtore his own choſen people, to reſtore Vs, and Our good Subjects to each other, and to ſhew Vs a very hopeful Proſpect, if not to put Vs already into poſſeſſion of that Peace, Happineſs, and Security with which this Our Kingdom hath been heretofore bleſſed; It will become Vs all, in Our ſeveral Stations, to acknowledge this tranſcendent goodneſs of Almighty God, in ſo ſeaſonable a conjuncture, with ſuch a Circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Integrity, and Reformation in Our Lives, that We may not drive away that Mercy which ſo near approacheth Vs, by making Our ſelves (wholly) unworthy of it. And in Order hereunto, We think it high time to ſhew Our diſlike of thoſe (againſt whom We have been ever enough offended, though We could not, in this manner declare it) who, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Affection to Vs and Our Service, aſſume to themſelves the liberty of Reviling, Threatning and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching others; and as much as in them lies, endeavor to ſtifle and divert their good Inclinations to Our Service, and ſo to prevent that Reconciliation and Vnion of Hearts and Affections, which can only, with Gods Bleſſing, make Vs rejoyce in each other, and keep Our Enemies from rejoycing.</p>
            <p>There are likewiſe another ſort of Men, of whom we have heard much, and are ſufficiently aſhamed, who ſpend their time in Taverns, Tipling-Houſes, and Debauches, giving no other Evidence of their Affection to Vs, but in drinking Our Health, and Inveighing, againſt all others, who are not of their own diſſolute temper; and who, in truth, have more diſcredited Our Cauſe, by the Licence of their Manners and Lives, then they could ever advance it by their Affection or Courage. We hope that this extraordinary way of delivering Vs all, from all We feared, and almoſt bringing Vs to all We can reaſonably hope, hath and will work upon the Hearts, even of theſe Men to that degree, that they will cordially renounce all that Licenciouſneſs, Prophaneneſs, and Impiety, with which they have been corrupted and endeavored to corrupt others, and that they will, hereafter, become examples of Sobriety and Virtue, and make it appear, that what is paſt, was rather the Vice of the Time, then of the Perſons, and ſo the ſitter to be forgotten together.</p>
            <p>And, becauſe the fear of Puniſhment, or apprehenſion of Our Diſpleaſure, may have influence upon many, who will not be reſtrained by the Conſcience of their Duty, We do declare, That We will not exerciſe just Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt any Malefactors, ſooner, then againſt Men of diſſolute, debauch'd, and prophane Lives, with what parts ſoever they may be otherwiſe qualified and endowed; and, We hope, that all Perſons of Honor, or in Place and Authority, will, ſo far aſſiſt Vs, in diſcountenancing ſuch Men, that their Diſcretion and Shame will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to reform what their Conſcience would not, and that the diſpleaſure of good Men towards them, may ſupply what the Laws have not; and, it may be, cannot well provide againſt, there being by the Licence and Corruption of the Times, and the depraved Nature of Men, many Enormities, Scandals, and Impieties, in Practiſe and Manners, which Laws cannot well deſcribe, and conſequently not enough provide againſt, which may by the example and ſeverity of Vertuous Men, be eaſily diſcountenanced, and by degrees ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>However, for the more effectual reforming theſe Men, who are a diſcredit to the Nation, and unto any Cauſe they pretend to favor, and to wiſh well to; We require all Majors, Sheriffs, and Iuſtices of Peace, to be very vigilant and ſtrict in the diſcovery and proſecution of all Diſſolute and Prophane Perſons, and ſuch as Blaſpheme the Name of God, by prophane Swearing and Curſing, or revile or diſturbe Miniſters, and deſpiſe the Publick Worſhip of God; that being firſt bound to the Good behavior, they may be further proceeded againſt, and expoſed to ſhame, in ſuch a manner, as the Laws of the Land, and the juſt and neceſſary Rules of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall direct or permit.</p>
