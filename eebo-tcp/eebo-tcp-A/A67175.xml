            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Deputy Recorder of the ſaid City, being the Day on which the Right Honourable <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Abingdon</hi> took the Oath, and accepted the Office of <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> of the City aforeſaid.</head>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> MAYOR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the Cuſtom of the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> the greateſt and wiſeſt People that ever liv'd, to dedicate their Cities and Free-towns to the care and protection of ſome God, to whom they fled in all their Calamities, if they were invironed by their enemies, or threatned with any impendent danger, there they ſought and there they expected to find relief.</p>
            <p>IN conformity to this great example, we of this place, tho' we do not pretend to ſuch a choice, have ſought and gain'd too the protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of one of the greateſt men; a perſon, who for his temperate zeal, for the eſtabliſh'd reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, his firm adherence to the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> his ſteady and unſhaken loyalty to the Crown, is deſervedly the glory of the preſent, and will be the wonder as well as the example of all ſucceeding Generations.</p>
            <p>WE have ſeen his unwearied pains in ſerving the Crown, we have taſted his pious care of us, our Liberties and Franchizes, and have in all reſpects found him a zealous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter of the public Good; and that which makes him more dear to us now, a Champion for the Rights and Priviledges of this Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Therefore he that ſhall ſearch the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and look into the former Triumphs and Glory of this City, will at no time find a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er occaſion of Joy than is now afforded us; for what can he that conſults the honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of this City deſire greater than to ſee this noble Lord become our Patron and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, to ſee him that has always made it his choice now make it his Duty to aſſiſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us?</p>
            <p>MY LORD,<lb/>
OUR unanimous Choice, the joyful Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and general Satisfaction which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended your Lordſhip's Election, do ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince how much you are the Darling of this City, and your Lordſhip's conſtant Inclination to aſſiſt us, even when you were under no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, doth give us all poſſible Aſſurance that we ſhall never fail of your Lordſhip's Care, Shelter and Protection.</p>
            <p>In humble Confidence of this, we do repoſe in your Lordſhip's Care, a City in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure worthy of ſo noble a Patron, a City com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of wiſe, diſcreet, and underſtanding Members, that have been in all Times famous for their Loyalty and Integrity to the Crown, and have therefore, in every King's Reign, ſince <hi>Henry</hi> II. been adorned with freſh Grants of Royal Franchizes, as Monuments, and noble Rewards of their couragious, and brave Adherence to their Sovereign. And laſtly, a City that has been always honoured with the Protection of the Prime and Flower of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, ſuch as amongſt many other were <hi>Ch. Brandon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk, Tho.</hi> Lord <hi>Cromwell, Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Bedford, Robert,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex, John</hi> Lord <hi>Williams,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Knollys,</hi> the Lord <hi>Eleemore,</hi> Lord High Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> the Lord <hi>Knollys,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Berks,</hi> and the late Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and we have now obtained the Protection of your Lordſhip alſo, as the Crown and Glory of them all.</p>
            <p>MY LORD,<lb/>
To perform well the Office of <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> of this City, requires no other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, than what you have always practiſed. It hath been your Lordſhip's continual Study to do us good, and thereby you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Office, without the leaſt View to your Lordſhip's Perſon.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip is now become as a Guardian Angel to this Place, and have given us a Title to bring our Complaints, and to pray your Aſſiſtance in all our Difficulties; and by the Security of ſo Noble a Patronage, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has given us an everlaſting Eſtabliſhment, and made us the Envy of all other Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thereby, as an humble Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the great Honour your Lordſhip has done us, I do, in behalf of myſelf, of this Houſe, and of the whole Body of this City, return your Lordſhip our humble and hearty Thanks, making this our moſt earneſt Requeſt to Heaven, that your Lordſhip may flouriſh in all Honour and Greatneſs, and that there may never be wanting one of your Lordſhip's Name and Blood to protect us ſo long as this Corporation laſt, which I hope will be to the World's End.</p>
