         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A motion to the <hi>Eaſt India Company</hi> by <hi>Thomas Smethwike</hi> (an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer with them) vpon the reaſons following.</head>
            <p>VVE haue now in <hi>India</hi> vpon the old ſtocks accompt and charge by the Committees owne ſhewing, 13 good ſhips of 5500 tonns, beſides 860 tons of trading ſhips and certaine frigots, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whereof 5 of 2200 tons arrived there 28 months agoe, 5 of 2200 tons 15 months agoe, and 3 of 1100 tons may be arrived there about 4 months ſince.</p>
            <p>What ſhould cauſe our ſhips to ſtay ſo long, if there were ſtock to buy their lading?</p>
            <p>Or how ſhould they be reladen thence in due time, if ſtock be wanting there?</p>
            <p>All our Factors in their letters (both formerly and of late received) cry out amaine for want of ſtock to trade withall, which hath maymed the trade, And ſay, they cannot diſpatch the ſhips in due time, without meanes aforehand, and that 200 M. <abbr>l</abbr> more then they haue, is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough to diſpatch the ſhips already there.</p>
            <p>5500 tons in ordinary good wares, (by the Comittees owne ſhewing) will coſt there 236 M. <abbr>l</abbr>.</p>
            <p>By their ſhewing we haue in all <hi>India</hi> but 90 M. <abbr>l</abbr>. whereof 60 M. <abbr>l</abbr>. not yet knowne to be arrived.</p>
            <p>So (admitting all arrived) there wants to lade the ſhips already in <hi>India</hi> 146 M. <abbr>l</abbr>.</p>
            <p>This great vvant hath not hapned by any late diſaſter, but is rather leſſned by 1200 tons of ſhipping lately fired and laid vp there without any goods loſt in them, and by opening the trade of <hi>Bantam</hi> where pepper is cheape, neither hath this want of ſtock beene vnknowne here, for a yeere, or two, or more.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes the 2 ſhips now going for the old ſtocks accompt (of 1600 tonns) are not to carry much more then will relade them with good wares (though not diminiſhed by charges of ſhips and Factors already there) and if we trade in courſe and bulky wares onely, it is granted already we had better ſit ſtill.</p>
            <p>Nay vnleſſe we ſend this yeere meanes aforehand to provide good lading for ſhips to goe hence the next yeere with freſh capitalls, we ſhall ſtill trade to loſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſending of 50 or 100 M. <abbr>l</abbr>. this yeere aforehand (in all probability) will be as good as twiſe ſo much ſent the next yeere, and ſo from yeere to yeere, And then halfe the treaſure yeerely to be tranſported will ſerue the turne; but ſparingly ſent, and many ſhips there vpon charge, it will be conſumed before its arrivall.</p>
            <p>Our ſhips (now adaies) doe vſually ſtay 18 or 20 months too long in <hi>India</hi> to their Ruine, and ſpending as much (brought a yeere or two after in other ſhips) as being ſent aforehand might well buy and pay for their lading in due time, and ſo returne ſtrong. Yet our Factors continually owe there mnch money at a high ratc of intereſt.</p>
            <p>By ſending meanes aforehand Merchantlike, we may profit much by trading there from port to port, and buy our wares at the beſt hand. We may avoid the great and needleſſe charge of many great ſhips ſtaying long in <hi>India;</hi> of paying a high rate of intereſt there, the loſſe of our Mariners, the decay of our ſhipping, and ſo their comming home in much danger. And then doubtleſſe this trade may againe yeeld the Adventurers 3 for one every 3 yeeres (as vſually it did) by the bleſſing of God. Yea if examination be had, it will appeare the returnes from <hi>India</hi> this yeere (vpon a reaſonable fraight allovved) produce neere 3 for one vvithout help of ſtock aforehand; and therefore very ſtrange the old ſtock (ſo great and ſo long employed) ſhould produce ſo diſmall a reckoning as it doth.</p>
            <p>The motionis. That the next weeke may be appointed for the Company to parlee, &amp; conſult together for the good of the trade in generall, and of the old decayed ſtocke in particular. Such as are Adventurers in the old ſtocke, and not in the new, to meete by themſelues, and the new Adventurers by themſelues. And then doubtleſſe (mett together) they will agree vpon ſome good courſe to be taken that the Trade may be amplie mainteined, and the Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ſtocke not ſtill runne (as long it hath) to perdition for want of meanes in <hi>India</hi> aforehand: And perhaps put an end to all the controverſies that now are (and like to be) amongſt the Company.</p>
