            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CHIEF MARK OF ALL The holy Scriptures.</head>
            <p>SVNDRY wayes doth our heavenly father draw vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of his ſonne: But Man created of God plain wilbe ſearching out many conceites, to his owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver throw: by the ſleight of Satan: as the Angels that kept not their place, fell to ruine. They being created the firſt day: &amp; hearing the voice of God which dwelleth in light that none can come too; ſaw that the frame of the world was not for Spirites vſe: the Sphaeres in their wonderfull greatnes &amp; ſwiftenes: the starres in theyr most beawtifull order: the vapours, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, &amp; cloudes in moſt wiſe peiſe, the plantes, foules, fishes, beaſtes, all theſe benefite not the Angels. But after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of all theſe, the holy trinity conſulteth for making man, in iuſtice &amp; plain holynes, &amp; maketh his body of the earth: that all thinges may ſerve his vſe: the ſtarres, the Elementes, the plantes &amp; all live thinges. And God doth breath into him a ſoule immortall, full of life, which might have kept the body allwayes alive: &amp; sheweth vnto Angels mans wiſdome, in that he nameth all beaſtes with termes defining theyr na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; maketh a woman outo ef his ſide, &amp; giveth them do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Earth: and g tivth his Angels charge over them, to attend vpon them, &amp; to kepe them. But one part miſlikeh this charge, &amp; by that rebellion extinguish their ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne light, &amp; loſe their owne glory, &amp; find miſery vnrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: &amp; ſeke leave to try man, whether he can be deceaved, to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6207:5"/>
caſt of the obedience of God, &amp; prevaileth, &amp; bringeth them to death of the ſoule, &amp; loſſe of that light which wold have kept the body alive for ever: &amp; into ſinne that draweth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall woe vpon it. And this diſobedience being wroght quickly the firſt day of man, brought all the world vnder cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and greved ſtill the holy spirit, &amp; his Angels. But then further counſell is shewed: that the ETERNALL Son of God will take Humanity of Eves Sede: and to him the world is ſubiectea, till an vncorruptible new world be made. But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withdrew belefe from this poinct; &amp; rules as Prince of the darkenes of this world, ſo as it is hard for Adams Sonnes bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in ſinne &amp; blindnes extreme, to hold this world curſed: vvhich yet all ſerveth mans vſe: and to hope for a world vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, for the ſoule leaving this life: &amp; of a new vvorld for the body &amp; ſoule. Seing Adam cared not for Gods charge, being yet in life &amp; Lordship, &amp; beleeved not the word of him who ſpake &amp; all thinges had theyr beynge: So the Sonnes of Adam will hardly beleve that the King of Glory must die to give life: and to lighte Adam by faith to life: and ariſe to raiſe Adam: and leave this world, to shew hope of an other world. Experience teacheth vs how far this is from vs.</p>
            <p>To this none can come vnleſſe the Father draw him. Yet Gods grace in governement condemneth all for not layng hand vpon this grace, and for not craving of grace truly ſo to doe. Now to shew that by death life should come, in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe a beaſt is killed: and with the ſkinne, our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes be clothed: and fyer from Heaven burneth the carcaſe: and the next day is appointed for a rest to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, on this: to whom able to governe, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Thus rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption vvas taught: &amp; anger by a curſe pronounced to come by the flood.

Yet then Christ shevved in Noah, how all beastes &amp; Elementes &amp; heavens obeyed him. Againe, they are told that Christ shall ariſe from Sem to be a King of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce &amp; peace. And, that, when the heathen receave the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſe, Iapheth his ſonnes shall have the chiefeſt continuance of grace: And Noes families be named; &amp; the Prophetes shew their nationes &amp; stories with Gods people. That matter is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Prophetes, ſpeaking still of the first families.</p>
            <p>But now they make the ſad bleſsing a ſkoph: and build a proud tower for worship to starres. Then GOD devided all their tongues, that they should no more heare his truth: to plead foolishly againſt it. And two thouſand yeares all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then eſtranged from GOD perished for ever &amp; ever. And in short ſpeches to Abraham, he foretelleth, that of him one shall come that shall bleſs all nationess: &amp; sheweth his death, &amp; recouery from death in Iſaak offred neare death,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6207:6"/>
but only by Gods voice, reſerved, as by a reſurrection: &amp; that Iacobs ſonnes should not worſhip starres above, or any thing on earth, they are ſtarres in Ioſephs dreame: &amp; precious ſtones in Aarons Breſt lap, or Care of iudgement. And to shew what iuſtice God required, they have plain Lawes of perfect Equity: with a curſe to all that kepe not every one: that men might know how sinne aboundeth: &amp; to the poore in ſpirit the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is declared in myſteries that the prophane should not skoff: yet plainly to ſuch as mark how Adam &amp; Abraham heard of him: &amp; life of the ſoule is shewed by dwelling with God: as the ſecond death for the ſoule, by anger from the face of God. Thus cloſly the world to come is shewed. Alſo the tabernacle, &amp; appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces shewed Christ his dwelling with man: &amp; by ſacrifices &amp; birdes eſcaped, his death &amp; reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that for iuſtice hence by faith men should not ſay: who can go vp to heaven to bring Christ downe, or who can goe to the depe of the earth to bring Chriſt from the dead, but might know that Ieſus should be the Eternal, &amp; that the Godhead should raiſe him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead. And the ſaving of our ſoules appeared, in the Braſen ſerpent, when Moſes lifted vp the ſerpent in the wildernes, &amp; the ſtonged by ſerpentes weare healed. Many dout leſſe asked him, what was meant therby: &amp; he told that ſo the ſun of man should be lifted vp: that they who beleved on him should not perish, but have life everlasting. Moſes mynd shined with knowledge of all, as did his face shine with light: &amp; Levies Sunlike Smaragd: &amp; his Prophecies abridg all the holy ſtories: &amp; he maketh the twelve dum ſtones tell much, from Aarons breſt: And the Patriarkes lives, have the like revolutiones in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: how for cleaving to the redeamer they should find glory,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6207:6"/>
&amp; againe shame in refuſing their fathers God, &amp; folowing the blindenes of the God of this world. Now in David God hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storically expreſſeth Christ his Kingdome. David cometh to his Kingdome by continuall afflictiones: &amp; ſo all that will fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the religion of Christ shalbe perſecuted. And by whom the covenant of God &amp; his law shall be kept to vanquish Satan, David is told: eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Chriſt shall come of his loynes to reigne vpon his throne for ever. Of him he shall come to be a man &amp; a King in this world: but he shall have no Kingdome in this world, &amp; the earth which God hath curſed: but to him is the world to come ſubdued: being the creator, &amp; David sheweth how yet in his ſuffringes &amp; death he was made infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Angels: but crowned with glory &amp; honour, ſince he ſate on the right hand of God. And when he came into the world, all the Angels of God worshipped him. And that Iuda should conſider how by ſuffrings this glory cometh, David deſcribeth as an Evangeliſt the ſuffringes of Chriſt. This David doeth. And telleth in Prophecies the overthrow of his nation, &amp; theyr captivity, &amp; retarne; &amp; Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus perſecutiones, &amp; the Iewes reiection: even all their ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: how God toke a time to plant them, &amp; will pluck them vp: to ſeke them, &amp; will deſtroy them: to kepe them &amp; will caſt them off: to love them, and will hate them. Now for experience that a Kingdome vnder the Sun was not promiſed in Chriſt, Salomon had all wiſdome, wealth &amp; pleaſure, &amp; found all to be vanitie: &amp; by his pleaſures fell from God: but returned, and teacheh in Eccleſiaſtes in all particular ſortes, that all here is but vanitie &amp; vexation of ſpirit: by mans dealinges, and by the ſorowes of theyr handes: and cloſly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6207:7"/>

And Salomon warneth the ten tribes, how they wilbe robbers making one purſe, and refuſe the love of the truth: and how God wold laugh at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by Aſsur: and fitted Proverbes to have kept them from deſtruction: And the ſonne of Thamar, of Rachab, of Ruth, of Bathſuagh in the Canticles turneth all ioy to the Kingdome of Chriſt: that Ioſephs houſe should not deſpiſe the root of Ieſſai, though Ieſus Son of Nun conquered the Land &amp; made the Sun to ſtay.

That did they ſone prove true.</p>
            <p>For the Kinges of Iuda were all eyther worshippers of Devels with many of theyr people, or, in ſome feeling of great danger &amp; diſtreſſe: or, in open hearing of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and that, many at once, that Babel should end their ſtate: and Salomons houſe: becauſe they followed Babel built to make Go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ddes of creatures.

And though Moſes tabernacle, were most diligently thriſe deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: &amp; furnished with all dignity of matter &amp; forme: yet God did ſone leave it in ſmalle regard: &amp; likewiſe Salomons temple. Yet against S. Stephens doctrine Act. 7. to this day Iſrael hopeth for a temple of ſtone, &amp; city to be built on mount Syon, in Chanaan. But our Lord leaveth this world, to ſit on Davids throne for ever: &amp; Iewes perish in their lyes, and blind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, &amp; for our Lords brightnes, foure Evangeliſtes tell that: &amp; one telleth how the Apoſtles taught that to the heathen; &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Epistles comment vpon all Moſes, to teach Iſraell the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den building, &amp; how their Thalmudicall is straw: in all hope of Policy good on Earth. And when Ieruſalem is destroyed to force an end of Moſes Ceremonies: then more fully the nature of Davids throne is opened by Gracious Iohn, in obſcure Patmos. He sheweth how all the goodly Iewels vſed through Moyſes and the Prophetes tend hither, how the knowledge of Chriſt practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed openly &amp; rightly by his ſervantes, maketh the heavenly Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: the holy Iewes a ey-expectation. But this should have two hinderances: one by the prophane Caeſares, whom the Lord wold pay for their partes: that all their world should be altered: the other by Christianes falling away, as Iſmael &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim did.

               <p>So <bibl>Eſay 66.</bibl>
                  <q>FROM MONETH TO MONETH AND FROM SABBAT TO SABBAT SHAL ALL FLESH COME TO WORSHIP BEFORE MEE SAYTH THE ETERNAL.</q> This sheweth an vtter abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Moſes: ſeing all nations cannot come every weeke to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</p>
               <p>The laſt is, <bibl>Malachi v. last ſaue one:</bibl>
                  <q>BEHOLD I SEND VNTO YOV AN ELIAS A PROPHET, BEFORE THE GREAT AND FEARFVLL DAY OF THE E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERNALL COMETH</q>: From that ſpeech cloſing the prophets, the Angell Gabriel beginneth the New Teſtament in his ſpeech to Zachary of his Malachy Iohn. So ſweetly both Teſtaments Kiſse one the other: that none of wit or grace should euer thinke Tobies foolish fable or Iudithes ridiculous ly to be from any ſad purpoſe of a writer.</p>

               <p>In this emptie ſpace, a ſpech worthy of place every where, may be added: which Gregor. Nazian. ſpeaketh vpon Chapt. 3. who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth the ſpirit of man which aſcendeth, Thus he ſayth: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> That is I ſaw in the low places: a dongeon of punishment, receaving the wicked: and an other place appointed for the Godly. Thus the father, who knew that Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſuch were in heaven, yet ſpeaketh as heathen did. This ſentence giveth light, for the vnderſtanding of the Greke fathers.</p>
