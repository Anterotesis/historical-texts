         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Plate, as well for the Advantage of the Owners thereof.
As for Raising
One Million of Money,
In (and for the Service of) the Year 1697.
By way of a
LOTTERY.</head>
            <p>WHerein the Benefits will be the same,<note place="margin">Blanks to be Prizes and paid in a Year.</note> and as many for once, as were
had in the Million Adventure; and the Blanks (being each to be
paid Ten Pound in New Money) will also be Prizes, to be paid soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or later as Chance shall determine; but all to be cleared in One Year.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Proposal is:</head>
               <p>That 100000 Tickets,<note place="margin">Proposal.</note> Numbred from 1 to 100000, be given out at 10 <hi>l.
per</hi> Ticket, to such as shall Voluntarily bring in their Money before the 24th of
<hi>Iune,</hi> 1697. to make up the Million aforesaid.</p>
               <p>That New Mill'd Money,<note place="margin">Silver 6 <hi>s.</hi> the Ounce.</note> or Hammered Silver Money, and Plate with the
Hall Mark upon't, or otherwise <hi>Sterling,</hi> shall be taken in, and Received at
6 <hi>s.</hi> an Ounce for such Tickets.</p>
               <p>That a Rebate (as was in the Million Lottery) after the Rate of 14 <hi>per Cent.</hi>

                     <hi>Rebate</hi> at 14 per Cent.</note>
be allowed for so many Days as the Money shall be paid in before the 24th of
<hi>Iune,</hi> 1697.</p>
               <p>That the Benefits, as well as the Blanks (which, considering the Advantages
given to every Adventurer, may well be called Prizes) shall all be paid off in
one Year, and in Course, which may thus be ascertain'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Before the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
begins 100 Tickets, Numbred from 1 to 100. signifying the first,<note place="margin">Course of Payment all in a Year.</note> second and
third (and so to 100) thousand, shall be put and well mixt in a Glass, and thence
Drawn, and such Number as comes first (and so successively) out, shall entitle
the Owner of the Benefits and Blanks Comprised in such 1000, to be first paid off
and cleared.</p>
               <p>And that the not yet paying the Tickets last <hi>Michaelmas</hi> due in the late <hi>Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Adventure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor the fear of its not being Full,<note place="margin">Why the old Tickets remained so long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid, and how they will be paid off &amp; cleared.</note> and that thereby the Benefits might come
to be any way lessened, may in no sort Discourage the bringing in the Money,
and that very quickly into't:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The not paying those Tickets, was not only occasioned by an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
that failed, but by a real Deficience in the Fund that was given, for the
first Three Years paying thereof, and the like cannot be supposed can any
way happen at all in the Fund herein after proposed for this; and every Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
for His or Her Satisfaction, may be pleased to take Notice, that a Duty
is Voted already on Leather, to pay off the Tickets in the <hi>Million Adventure,</hi> and
Annuities due, and by which they'll be certainly paid.</p>
               <p>And to the other Objection,<note place="margin">This must and will be thus cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Full.</note>

100000 shall not be took out, and paid for by particular Persons, before the
24th of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1697. may either be paid out as Money, or without any Loss to
the Publick (and therefore will) be taken and paid for out of the Money that
shall be first Raised from the Duty, to be given for the thus supplying this
Million.</p>

a Million of Money: And if it may so be given for two Years as aforesaid, the First
Million may go for the War, and the Remainder for the Civil List, which on
