         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord of <hi>Care</hi> went forth with
ſixe thouſand Rebels, and marched
to <hi>Clogham</hi> three miles from <hi>Cary</hi>
and fired it, and murdered all the
Proteſtants which lived there, that
was but foure Houſholds. They entred the
<pb facs="tcp:96026:3"/>
houſe of one <hi>Simon Sloper</hi> a Marchant, and ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
his wife before his face, and then hanged
him at his doore: then they marched to Kilwort,
a great <hi>Engliſh</hi> town, and of very great buildings,
but by the way they came to Maſter Moulſeies
houſe, an Engliſh man, aud a trooper to the Earle
of Wormod.</p>
            <p>But hee himſelfe vvas not at home, for they
ſoone entred the houſe, and murdered all that
were in it to the number of 15 ſervants and
children: when they had done this bloudy deed
they took the old gentlewoman, and hanged her
upon the walls before the gate, ripping up her
belly, and ſo cruelly in an inhumane manner
tooke out her bowels, and wrapped them about
her necke, and then would have fired the houſe,
but could not, it being all ſtone-worke.</p>
            <p>Then they batred downe the houſe, and ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
away toward Kilmouth, who preſently took
the towne, and batring dovvne the houſes about
their eares, murdering all the proteſtants that
they could meet with, be ſetting the town round
about, to the intent that none ſhuld eſcape there
hands: thus they murdered them all in a cruell
manner, ſome having their quarters torne in
pieces, deflouring the women, and hanging their
quarters upon the walls, and hanging ſome up
by the heeles, whipping them to death, &amp; others
tare rhe fleſh from their bones with pinceeres,
and hanging little children upon hookes by the
<pb facs="tcp:96026:3"/>
throat, thus when they had ſearched the Tovvne
in every houſe, and tooke armes for 300. men,
in like manner dealt they with Iormoy, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock;
for there they ripped children out of
their Mothers wombes, and hanged them up, &amp;
trampled them under their feet.</p>
            <p>There lived on Marke-Davo, ſeven miles
from the aforeſaid Lord of Care, vvho had built
a caſtle by the black-water ſide, which have bin
many yeeres of building; for the wall was 6.
foot thicke, and valted round about.</p>
            <p>Wherein he did keepe 6 Smiths at work for
the ſpace of two yeeres, making proviſion for
vvar, &amp; now of late hee bought all the beſt horſe
that he could get, his trechery is now diſcovered
for upon the 20. day of Decem. he marched out
the aſſiſtance of the ſaid Lord of Care, vvith
one thouſand foot, and tvvo hundred horſe, they
marched tovvard Feather about 10. miles from
him, a vvalled tovvn moſt inhabited with Iriſh,
and as ſoone as hee came thither with his forces
the gates vvere preſently opened: but as ſoone as
he vvas entred, they preſently maſſacred the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtants,
and taking Mr. Lovv the Miniſter they
cut out his tongue, fleying the skin off his head,
&amp; backe, ſaying, that they vvould make a Drum
head of his skin, that the Hereticks may heare
the ſound of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96026:4"/>
Then they hanged his quarters on the Gates
but his wife they killed not, by reaſon that their
intent is to keepe her, and ſo to have her to full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill
their Luſt when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The Towne and Caſtle they keepe in their
cuſtody, and leave a ſtrong guard for the ſafety of
it. The other marched from thence to <hi>Clummell,</hi>
a very ſpacious towne, it being five miles from
<hi>Feather</hi> aforeſaid, and they battered downe the
greateſt part of the towne, and murdered moſt
of the proteſtants there, and got armes for a 100.
men: and thus marching from thence towards
<hi>Turlow,</hi> they met with that cruell and bloud-thirſty
Rebell, the trecherous Earle of <hi>Care,</hi> with
his forces, and ſo marched together towards the
City <hi>Talow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now courteous Reader, all this aforeſaid
being dolefull and lamentable, I will bring thee
to a true and joyfull Relation.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> having notice that
the three great rebels aforeſaid were marching
towards Talow, he therefore cauſed the drums to
beat up, to call his forces together, and then
ſpake to them to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Fellow ſouldiers and Countrey-men, give mee
leave to ſpeake ſome fevv vvords unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvhich
