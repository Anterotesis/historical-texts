         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are but three reasons indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
an Author to dedicate his
Book to any one man, rather
than to another: The first is
the patronage of his Work, under the
shelter of some o're-spreading tree, whose
armes may happily receive the suppliant
under his protection, and defend it from
the stormes of persecution. The second is
a willingnesse in the Author, to expresse a
Gratitude by Dedication, by reason of some
former Courtesies received. And the
third is a fitnesse in the person to whom he
dedicates his book, whereby his dedication
may become suitable to such a Patronage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100969:4"/>The first I never affected, as never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving

               </gap> sufficient authority to dignifie
the patronage, if it had not that within it

that expression of the Father of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish

gratefull to my friends, and where such
love and gratitude cannot otherwise goe
or stand upon their owne legs on any
ground, they shall both creep on paper;
wherefore, most worthy Cousin, having
received so great a benefit (at your hands
beyond the Seas) as in my low condition,
not onely at once to relieve the Father in
his necessity, but also to adde so bountifull
a hand in the bringing up of that child,
which by you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100969:4"/>Nor is the dedication of the History (of

to your selfe altogether improper for you,

in their agreement, the one diligently preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the coming of Christ to be at hand, giving

why the Father gave unto this Son that

               <p>Nor did he suffer her to rest thus satisfied

dedicated to Christ our Saviour, and called
it <hi>Christs Colledge,</hi> largely endowing the same

not onely bear a portion in the charge of the

whereby four Fellowships were founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own account, and one Reader of an
Hebrew Lecture, and another of Greek,
together with four examining Readers, and
four under-Readers, to help the Principall;
and whereas he observed the price of Victuals
began to rise, he gave wherewith (by weekly

augmented, bequeathing thereunto his Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>NOw was the time come, wherein God
was determined to make triall of his
people; and the storme was not altogether
unseen, to ensue by this good man: for by
this time, the people of this Nation had well
drank of the intoxications of Prince <hi>Luthers</hi>

and how <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine was now
come from private whisperings, to open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations:
(whereby all authority, either
of Pope or Emperour, King, or Bishop, or
any superiority whatsoever, was much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
and debased, a new way of Salvation
found out, a neerer, readier, and cheaper
way to Heaven propounded; and liberty of

conscience promised to all that were Believers
in his Gospell, all thinking him a brave fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and who but <hi>Luther,</hi> that cared neither
for Pope, nor Emperour) this holy Prelate
began to looke about, and bestir himselfe;
and questionlesse had out-rid the storme, had
not his hand been taken from the steerage,

For,</p>
               <p>Hereupon this good Bishop, first acts the
part of a good Chancellour, and set all right
in that University in generall, especially in
those Colledges, whereof he had peculiar
jurisdiction: where he took an occasion to
provide in the Statutes, that the Fellows
of those Houses should so order their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as that the fourth part of them might
be Preachers: so that as soon as one was
gone abroad, another should be ready to
succeed in his place, that if it were possible
the young Cubbe might be catch'd at his first
arrivall.</p>
               <p>Then he returned to his pastorall charge at
<hi>Rochester;</hi> and there, setting his owne Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in good order, he fell to Writing, and
diligent Preaching, procuring others (whose
abilities were best known unto him) to doe
the like; but, perceiving the disease to

other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the rest of the
Physitians, not so ready to set thereto their
helping hands (as the necessity of the cause
required) he not onely called for help from
the King, but by his perswasions, and at his
instance, the King himselfe set upon the
head of all those mischiefs, and wrote a book

Dr. <hi>Iohn Longland,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
to the King, a very timerous man, and
one that was afraid to say or doe any thing

by any means he should further the same as

having given him his lesson, within two

to the King, and after that he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed
a while with him concerning the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of the Marriage, he adviseth him by all

advise with his ghostly Father, which when he
had done, his ghostly Father was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the man which the Card<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> took him to
be; for when the King advised with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the businesse, he put it off from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and advised his Majesty to consult with
some other, that were the most learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
whereupon the Cardinall had a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to play for that, which he thought to have
got by slight of hand; for now the King
was pleased to send for the most able Bishops
and Divines that he could think upon;
amongst all which there was not any
one in all his kingdome of whom he had a
more reverend estimation both for honestly
and learning, than he had of Doctor <hi>Fisher</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> wherefore he was one of
the nominates within the list of summons to
a meeting at the Cardinall's house in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
where after much debatement of the
businesse, and that the Bishop of <hi>Roshester</hi>
had fully answered and refelled all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

and given concerning the validity of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
(to the satisfaction of most of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops)
he concluded that there was no cause
at all of any question to be made, seeing the
marriage between the King and the Queen
was good and lawfull from the beginning,
and that therefore it was necessary to remove
that scruple from the Kings breast as soone
as possible, and so the Conference was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>While the Clergy were all thus dancing
about a scruple, in a lofty room led by the
Cardinall, they were not aware of the loose
fire which was brought into the powder,
room, which was under them ready, and at
last blew them all up: for just in this nick of
time the King was deeply falne in love with a
faire young Gentlewoman of the Court,
then waiting upon the Queen, called Mrs.
<hi>A. Bullein</hi> (secretly a Lutheran, and the first
that ever opened her mouth to advise the K.

the Kings minde (having conceived
within himself a possibility of riddance from
his old wife, and probability of having issue

to have her <hi>nolens volens,</hi> whereupon for the
present, he shewed her great favour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
unto her many signs of the love, which
she was yet ignorant of, so that now he was
resolved upon a hand gallop in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>Insomuch, that when the Cardinall (insci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

as he was advised; for the Bishop being sent
for, and come into the Kings presence, the
King treated him with exceeding courtesie

               <p>The Lady takes his advise, and addresses

not be so, and sent immediately for the Lady

               <p>Thus you see concerning the first particular,

1. In loosing and binding sinners, according to
that which our Saviour sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> unto St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
when he ordained him head of his Church, viz.
to thee will I give the keyes of the Kingdome of
Heaven. Now my Lords, can we say unto the
King, <hi>tibi,</hi> to thee will I give the keyes of the
Kingdome of Heaven? If you say I, where
is your wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

answered your selves, that you cannot put such
keyes into his hands.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Supreme Government of the
Church consists in feeding Christs Sheep and
Lambs, according unto that, when our Saviour
performed that promise unto <hi>Peter,</hi> of making
him his universall Sheepherd; by such unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

but feed those that are the feeders of those
lambes, feed my sheep: Now my Lords, can
any of us say unto the King, <hi>Pasce oves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God hath given unto his Church some to be

Christ, so that you must make the King one of
these, before you can set him one over
these, and when you have made him one of these
supreme Heads of the Church, he must be such
a Head as may be answerable to all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

of an Island that must constitute a Head

him more enlargement within the Tower,

hearing of her Fathers being there, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to inform her self of the event of that

him to see his own error; with that Mrs.
<hi>Margaret</hi> gave a spring for joy, and asked
him, Are you sure that my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi>
hath taken the Oath? Yes, said the Lord
Chancellour; and more than that, he is now
with the King, and you will see him at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

said the Lord Chancelour, and perswade
your Father (that he doe not) before he be

it is a great pity that such a man as he should
be cast away. Away goes Mrs. <hi>Margaret</hi> to
her father, but could not be admitted to speak

A Bishop is a correcter of Vice, but no president
for Sin.</hi> After they had had much talk to
this, and no purpose, Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> was
sent for to appeare before the Lords, where
he was no sooner entred the Room, but they
all called upon him to do as my Lord of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
had done before him; all of them
using no other arguments, but my Lord of
<hi>Rochester,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Rochester,</hi> as my Lord
of <hi>Rochester</hi> had shewed him a good example;
Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> asked them where my Lord
of <hi>Rochester</hi> was? saying, that if he could but
speak with my Lord of <hi>Rochester,</hi> it may be his
motives might induce him to take the Oath;
they told him that my L. of <hi>Roch.</hi> was where
he might also be, <hi>viz.</hi> with the King, if that he
would do but as he hath done: May I not
speak with him, said Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> before
I take this Oath? They answered, that he
should speak with him as soon as ever he had
taken it, but to speak with him before, was
not so proper, because then it would be said
he pinn'd his judgement upon anothers
sleeve, neither would they wish him to desire
it, in regard that the King would then have
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100969:87"/>
cause to thank the Bishop, and not him, for
such his condescention; and besides, that
would be too great a sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

tell you, said Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> that I do not
believe that my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> hath either
subscribed his hand, or taken the Oath;
and if he had done both, I could do neither.
Whereupon they were both sent back to the
Tower.</p>
               <p>The King (seeing these engines would not

he also was intituled, <hi>Sanct. Ro. Ecclesiae

else that he might thereby heap further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

displeasure against him: and this was it that
clean threw him over the perch, and brought

which his <hi>MAIESTY</hi> (by your

them higher than what deservedly can
stoop so low to take into due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so meane worth as that which every

search into me; however, according to the

ability and faithfulnesse which is resident in

freely, and without feare of any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
towards me, than what is just and
honourable.</p>
               <p>As to the businesse of Supremacy I must

him heretofore, and would so tell him, if I
were to die this present hour, that it is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unlawfull; and therefore I would not
wish his Majesty to take any such power or
title upon him, as he loves his own soule, and
the good of his posterity; for it will be such

that first assumed it: And to what purpose
were it to make me his Vicar generall of his

which Commission was dated the first

presented to the Commissioners sitting in

the <hi>Carthusians</hi> were shortly after arraigned,

were all three put to death at Tyburne, the

Messenger that passed between the King and
him, as ye have read before, who openly, in
the presence of the Judges, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

he heard the Prisoner say in plaine words,
within the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> that he believed
in his conscience, and by his learning he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
knew, that the King neither was, nor
by right, could be Supreme head in earth of
the Church of <hi>Engl.</hi> When this blessed Father
heard the accusations of this most wretched
&amp; false person, contrary to his former oath &amp;
promise, he was not a little astonied thereat;
wherefore he said to him in this menner: Mr.

in, and beare witnesse against me of these
words, knowing in what secret manner you
came to me; but suppose I so said unto you,
yet in that saying I commited no Treason;
for upon what occasion, and for what cause
it might be said, your self doth know right
well, and therefore being now urged (said
he) by this occasion, to open somewhat of
this matter, I shall desire, my Lords, and
others here, to take a little patience in
hearing what I shall say for my self.</p>
               <p>This man (<hi>meaning Mr.</hi> Rich) came to me
from the King, as he said, on a secret message
with commendations from his Grace, declaring
at large what a good opinion his Majesty had of
me, and how sorry he was of my trouble, with
many more words than are here needfull to be
recited, because they tended so much to my
praise, as I was not onely ashamed to hear them,
but also knew right well that I could no way
deserve them; at last he broke with me of the
matter of the Kings Supremacy, lately granted
unto him by Act of Parliament, to the which
he said, although all the Bishops in the Realme
have consented, except your selfe alone, and
also the whole Court of Parliament, both spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and temporall, except a very few; yet he
told me, that the King, for better satisfaction of
his owne conscience, had sent him unto me in this

herein frankly and freely advertise his Maj. my
knowledge, that upon certificate of my misliking,
he was very like to retract much of his former
doings, and make satisfaction for the same, in
case I should so advertise him: when I had
heard all his message, and considered a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his words, I put him in minde of the new Act
of Parliament, which standing in force as it doth

any thing that were offensive against the Law:
to that he told me, that the King willed him to
assure me on his honour, and in the word of a
King, that whatever I should say unto him by
this his secret messenger, I should abide no
danger no perill for it, neither that any advn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
should be taken against me for the same, no,
although my words were never so directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Statutes seeing it was but a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my minde secretly to him, as to his owne
person: and for the messenger himselfe, he gave
me his faithfull promise that he would never

let me, by your patience, sleep an houre or
two, for I have slept very little this night.
And yet to tell you the truth, not for any
feare of Death (I thank God) but by reason
of my great infirmity and weaknesse. The

that you should use as little speech as may be,

beholders mervailed much to see a living
man so farre consumed, for he seemed a very
Image of Death, and as it were Death in a

it was thought the King was something

and constant courage, and such a reverend

and with so loud and cleare a voice, that
the people were astonished thereat, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

heard and perceived, than he was. Then after
these few words by him uttered, he kneeled
down on both, his knees and said certain
Prayers, among which one was the Hymn of
<hi>Te Deum Laudamus,</hi> to the end, and the
Psalm <hi>In te Domine Speravi.</hi> Then came the
Executioner, and bound a handkercheif about
his eyes; and so this holy Father lifting up
his hands and heart towards heaven, said a
few prayers which were not long, but fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
and devout: which being ended, he
laid his head down on the middle of a little
block, where the Executioner being ready,
with a sharp and heavy Ax cut asunder his
slender neck at one blow, which bled so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
that many wondred to see so much
blood issu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As concerning the Head, the Executioner
put it into a bag, and carried it away with
him, meaning to have set it on the Bridge
that night, as he was commanded. The Lady
<hi>Anne Bullein</hi> (who was the chief cause of
this holy mans death) had a certain desire to
see the head before it was set up; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being brought unto her, she beheld it a
space, and at last, contemptuously, said these
or the like words: <hi>Is this the head that so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
exclaimed against me? I trust it shall never
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100969:111"/>
do no more harm:</hi> &amp; with that, striking it upon
the mouth with the back of her hand, hurt one
of her fingers upon a tooth that stuck some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more out than the rest did, which fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
after grew sore, and putting her to pain
many dayes after, was nevertheless cured at
last, with much difficulty. But after it was
healed, the mark of the hurt place remained
to be seen when her own head was not to be
seen upon her shoulders.</p>
               <p>This may seem strange, as a rare example
of cruell boldness in that sex, which by nature
is fearfull, and cannot behold such spectacles,
and therefore argueth (no doubt) a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
malice which she, by likelihood, bare to
the holy man living, that could thus cruelly
use his head, being dead. Then the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
stripping the body of his shirt and all his
clothes, he departed thence, leaving the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
carkasse naked upon the Scaffold, where
it remained after that sort for the most part
of that day, saving that one for pity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
sake, cast a little straw over his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
&amp; about eight of the clock in the evening
commandment came from the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
to such as watched about the dead
body (for it was still watched with many hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds
&amp; weapons) that they should cause it to
be buried. Whereupon two of the watchers

took it upon a holbert between them, and so
carried it to a Church-yard there hard by, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Alh: Barkin,</hi> where on the Northside of the
Church hard by the wall, they digged a grave
with their halberds, and therein, without any
reverence, tumbled the body of this holy,
Prelate, all naked and flat upon his belly,
without either shirt, or other accustomed
thing belonging to a christian mans buriall,
and so covered quickly with earth. And this
was done on the day of St. <hi>Albane</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

being parboyled, was pricked upon a pole

suffered death lately before him. And here I
cannot omit to declare unto you the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
sight of this head, which after it had
stood up the space of fourteen dayes upon
the bridge, could not be perceived to wast
nor consume, neither for the weather, which
then was very hot, neither for the parboyling
in hot water, but grew daily fresher and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher,
so that in his life-time he never looked
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100969:112"/>
so well, for his cheeks being beautified with
a comely red, the face looked as though it
had beholden the people passing by, and
would have spoken to them, which many
took for a miracle, that Almighty God was
pleased to shew above the course of nature,
in this preserving the fresh and lively colour
in his face, surp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

alive, whereby was noted to the world the
innocence and holinesse of this blessed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that thus innocently was content to
lose his head in defence of his Mother, the
holy Catholique Church of Christ; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the people coming daily to see this
strange sight, the passage over the bridge was
so stopped with their going and coming, that
almost neither cart nor horse could passe:
and therfore at the end of fourteen daies
this Executioner was commanded to throw
downe the head in the night-time into the

and fellow in all his troubles, who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
his passion the 6. day of <hi>Iuly</hi> next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>And touching the place of his buriall in

noted and wrote the course of things,
and with lesse fear and suspition then any of

for the space of seaven yeares after his buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
there grew neither leaf nor grasse upon
his grave, but the earth still remained as bare
as though it had been continually occupied
and trodden.</p>
               <p>When by common fame this bloudy Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
was blown and spread abroad, straight

odious among all good people, not onely in
his own Realm at home, but also among all

Christendome, insomuch that <hi>Paul</hi> the third,
then Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> with great grief signified
these doings by severall Letters to all the
Christian Princes, openly detesting the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of King <hi>Henry,</hi> in committing such a
wicked and manifest injury, not onely against
the freedome and priviledge of the Church

               <p>Neither hath God in these our unfortunate

in his own daies, and some since, shall easily
perceive that he was a man for his profound
learning, and rare vertue, highly reverenced
and esteemed thoroughout all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>And no doubt but if his writings and doings
be well compared, ye shall find him most like
those holy Fathers and Doctors, that in the
Primitive Church laid the very first ground
and foundation of our belief, upon the which
we have since rested and stayed our selves,
whom to describe wholly and fully unto you,
according to his worthiness, I will not take
upon me, neither am able to doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, yea

subtill as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as copious as <hi>Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
or as profound in Philosophy as <hi>Plato,</hi>
such, and so innumerable were his singular
vertues.</p>
               <p>But herein I will content my self with the
generall commendation, which all the famous
Universities of Divinity in <hi>Europe</hi> do give
this learned man, by calling him blessed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100969:118"/>
and alledging his works for great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Thus much I may also say, that unto
<hi>Iustus</hi> his predecessor, the first Bishop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
he was a just and true Successor; the
place of his birth he doth greatly beautifie
with the glorious Bishop St. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Beverly;</hi>
to the Country of <hi>Kent,</hi> where he was Bishop,
he is an ornament with St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi>
in gravity of his writing he is to be
reverenced with St. <hi>Bede;</hi> for stout defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the right and liberty of the holy Church,
against the power of Princes, he is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the blessed Bishop St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
and St. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and persecutors he resembleth holy St.

in the manner of his death to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist.</p>
               <p>And now we shall observe the wonderfull
working of Almighty God, whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are secret and strange in our sight,
much to be marked and noted in him and his
adherents; for as God of his own nature is
patient and long suffering, because he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctth
the amendment of our sinfull lives: so
is he also just in his doings, and pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

grievously, when no amendment is endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as now may well be perceived by those

in being his through his desire of change,
found change a robbery to his own hearts
contentment in so many wives, which lawfully

were none of his, for of the six bells whereon
he rung this change, two of them were repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,

the last so displeasing to him, as he had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to have sent her to the Tower so far

Martyrs conjectured; thereupon it came to
passe, for, said he in the Convocation-house,
(when this businesse was in scanning) the King
desires that we would make him head of the
Church; his successors will expect to be the
like: what if his Successor should chance to
be a child, or a woman, how shall we be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by such? and accordingly the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to shew us the ridiculousnesse of the usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
left him none but women and a

child to succeed him in that office; women
that could not speak, and a childe that knew
not how in the Church of God, till at the
length he had neither male nor female to sit
any more upon the Throne than in the Chair,
Death having made all their hands (issueless)
as unapt to sway the Scepter, as improper for
