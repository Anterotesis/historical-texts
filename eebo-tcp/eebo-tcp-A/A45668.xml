            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter <hi>Columbus</hi> returned from his Diſcovery of the Land now called <hi>America,</hi> he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened into Company with ſome <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who had the Vanity to tell him, that he had done nothing, but what they could do as well as he; Yes, Gentlemen, ſaid he, now I have ſhown you the way; he called for a Hens Egg, and deſired them to make it ſtand on one end, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaning,) on a ſmooth and flat Table, they all tryed, but none of them could make it ſo to ſtand; he
<pb facs="tcp:108771:5"/>
tryed after them, and made it ſtand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo could they alſo, when he had ſhewed them the way: I doubt not but in a ſhort time, there will be many Pretenders to the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,</hi> and to underſtand it better then I; be pleaſed to remember that I ſhewed the way (or can if I pleaſe.) Miſtake me not; think not that I am deſigned in this ſmall Treatiſe, to Teach the whole Art of <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;</hi> Art <hi>Mathematick</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Copious, part of which is Art <hi>Longitude,</hi> Ingenious and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious, requiring much larger <hi>Volumes</hi> then this is; I ſay, I can (if I will,) God willing, ſhew you the true Principles, the right <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> and <hi>Baſis,</hi> whereon this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick may be built; one Man might carry a Stone, to St. <hi>Pauls-Church</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and lay it on the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,

give Directions for Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, but he alone could never have perfected, (as now it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is,) that Stately and Glorious <hi>Edifice;</hi> I may begin my work to Day, but what Encouragement I may meet with in carrying it on, I know not; or if it may pleaſe God that I may live to ſee this Art brought to ſuch Perfection, as to be fit for Seamens Practiſe; ſome Years ago, I preſented a few Lines concerning this Art, to a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman,</hi> or Perſon of <hi>Quality,</hi> which Lines he little underſtood, and leſs regarded; which one of my Friends underſtanding, well compared to caſting <hi>Pearl</hi> before <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I have been informed of one who pretended to find the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,</hi> and requiring a Gratuity, was ſent to Mr.— to have his
<pb facs="tcp:108771:6"/>
Approbation; I think they might as well a ſent him to a been Rob'd; I Diſcourſed this Art with ſome Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the R. S. whom I found too much aiming at their peculiar Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; therefore I reſolved to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the Publick Stage, in Print, Nevertheleſs, the Deſcription is a little <hi>Veiled,</hi> though it is what I thought convenient to Publiſh; As for my Stile, I underſtand not how to Expreſs my Sentences, in <hi>Topical Syllogiſms,</hi> or <hi>Sophiſtical Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;</hi> if you meet with a plain Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, downright Reaſoning, and matter of Purpoſe, it is what I aim at; I know my Method differs much from other Writers, I write the Truth to the beſt of my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and value not <hi>Carpels;</hi> and in ſpite of Envie, I preſume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That I believe there are but
<pb facs="tcp:108771:6"/>
few Marriners in <hi>England,</hi> that underſtand how to keep an Account of a Ships way on the Sea, as well as I have done, or may do; and if I know more than others, it is by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority,</hi> by <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> by an Inborn <hi>Idea,</hi> and Inſtinct in <hi>Nature;</hi> it was ordained for me by God Almighty, from my <hi>Mother's Womb.</hi> My Knowledge in the Mathematicks is but little, therefore I dare not compare my ſelf to the Learned Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> and many others, who have writ large Vollumes of <hi>Geometry, Algebra,</hi> and <hi>Cubick Aequations. Brother Tar,</hi> there have been in <hi>England,</hi> many Pretenders to the <hi>Longitude,</hi> and ſome have writ concerning it: If thou haſt this ſmall <hi>Treatiſe</hi> by thee, thou mayſt find more in it fit for thy purpoſe and Peruſal, then
<pb facs="tcp:108771:7"/>
in any former Book of this Nature; there have been many Perſons, when they have attained ſome Knowledge in <hi>Coſmography,</hi> and Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally thinking on ſome of the ways contained in this Book, believe they have found the <hi>Longitude,</hi> and trouble their Brains to little purpoſe. Therefore, this <hi>Book</hi> is very convenient to eaſe their <hi>Brains,</hi> from ſuch Burdens; becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all the moſt noted ways, and Fundamental Principles, whereby the moſt <hi>Learned</hi> of this Age, have endeavoured to find the <hi>Longitude;</hi> and whereas you may think that this Book doth not wholly inform you of any Practical Method, for finding the <hi>Longitude;</hi> yet it is hoped that the ſaid Science will become Practicable, in few Years, (and already is to the Ingenious,
<pb facs="tcp:108771:7"/>
but not to the Ignorant.) Till then I adviſe you, duly to conſider the <hi>Fifth Chapter</hi> in this <hi>Book,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Magnetick Variation,</hi> which if you underſtand well, you have gained a Science, that for <hi>Seamen's</hi> Practice, is little Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the <hi>Longitude:</hi> How the World may eſteem of this <hi>Book,</hi> I cannot tell, but I hope it will be as a Safeguard, or means to ſave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Ship, from being Wreckt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar, and ſave many a <hi>Seamans Life.</hi> Some <hi>Blockheads</hi> are apt to ſay, the <hi>Longitude</hi> cannot be found; no, no, it cannot Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, as a Sow does a T—d in the <hi>Streets,</hi> but by Care, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and Induſtry, it may be found, without which, it cannot be underſtood. Though we have been at the <hi>Dutch</hi> for <hi>Hydrographical</hi>

and <hi>Geographical</hi> Draughts; let us not go the to <hi>French</hi> to learn their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. But why do I reflect, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no Thanks for my Pains, but to be reflected on again, as <hi>Harriſon</hi>'s <hi>Whimſies,</hi> or the like; I pray for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, how many ſuch Whimſical <hi>Inventions</hi> can my <hi>Country-Men</hi> boaſt of, that they have not borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d?

                  <p>Major <hi>Holmes</hi> at his return, hath made a Relation concerning the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Pendulums,</hi> which ſurpaſſeth my Expectation; I did not imagine that the Watches of this firſt Structure, would ſucceed ſo well, and I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd my main Hopes for the New ones: but ſeeing thoſe have already ſerv'd ſo ſucceſsfully, and that the other are yet more Juſt and Exact, I have the more Reaſon to believe, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108771:18"/>
the Invention of <hi>Longitudes,</hi> will come to its Perfection. In the mean time, I ſhall tell you, that the <hi>States</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Propoſition, when I deſired of them a Patent for theſe New Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the recompence ſet apart for the Invention, in caſe of Succeſs; and that without any difficulty, they have granted my Requeſt, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to bring one of theſe Watches into their Aſſembly, to explicate unto them, the Invention, and Application thereof to the <hi>Longitudes,</hi> which I have done to their Contentment. I have this Week Publiſhed, that theſe Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhall be expoſed to Sale, together, with an Information, neceſſary to uſe them at Sea; and thus I have broken the Ice. The ſame Objection that hath been made in your Parts, againſt the Exactneſs of theſe <hi>Pendulums,</hi> hath alſo been made here, to Wit, that though they ſhould agree together, they might fail both of them, by Reaſon that the Air at one time might be thicker, then at another. But I have anſwered, that this difference, if there be any, will not at all be perceiv'd in the <hi>Penduls,</hi> ſeeing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108771:18"/>
that the continual Obſervations made in Winter, from Day to Day, until Summer, have ſhewed me, that they have always agreed with the Sun, <hi>(I doubt the Truth.)</hi> As to the Printing the <hi>Figure</hi> of my New Watch, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that yet a while; but it ſhall in time appear, with all the Demonſtrations thereof, together with a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Pendulums,</hi> written by me ſome Days ſince, which is of a very ſubtle Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>I have read of a Glaſs <hi>Globe,</hi> that a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> had, in which he could ſee all the Coeleſtial Motions; of the ſame kind with our Clocks and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, though perhaps more Elaborate and Subtle, was that <hi>Sphere</hi> Invented by <hi>Archimides,</hi> which did repreſent the Heavenly Motions, the Diurnal and Anual Courſe of the Sun, the Changes and Aſpects of the Moon. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is frequently Celebrated in the writings of the Antients.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108771:19"/>
Motion is ſo much ſlower then at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> but in his Preface to the Reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith, This Paragraph, ought thus to be Corrected, that the further you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards either <hi>Pole,</hi> their Motion is ſwiſaer, and the further they are carryed towards the <hi>Equator,</hi> their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is retarded, &amp;c. The cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Inſtruments may move ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nigh the <hi>Poles,</hi> then near the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial,</hi> cannot proceed from the Oval Form of the Earth, as ſome think; the cauſe of their ſwifter Motion nigher the <hi>Poles,</hi> in my Opinion is cold Weather, and Froſts; I believe that in <hi>England,</hi> in Froſty Weather, our Clocks move ſwifter then in Summer, for in Froſty Weather, Springs may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a little, and grow ſtiffer, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have more force to make a ſwifter Motion; and in Hot Weather they may extend, and be a little more pliable, therefore the Motion may not prove altogether ſo ſwift as in <hi>Froſts:</hi> There are other Cauſes alſo, that may hinder the regularity of their Motions; ſee Ph. tr. N. 47. p. 951. and 976. Some may deſire to know my Reaſons for Springs, contracting in <hi>Froſty</hi> Weather,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108771:20"/>
take a piece of Cold <hi>Iron</hi> or <hi>Steel,</hi> one or two Foot long, about ½ or ¾ of an Inch Square, heat it red hot, keep heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and well Hammering it hot an Hour or two, when you have done, meaſure its length exactly before it be Cold, lay it aſide in the Air, where the <hi>Froſt</hi> may ting it a Winters Night, and if you meaſure it in the Morning, you will find it conſiderably ſhorter. Experience teacheth, that there are few <hi>Watches</hi> that have a regular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it ſeems impoſſible, that the <hi>Springs</hi> in all their parts, ſhould be ſo exactly Hammered, as to draw always equally, and by what I can learn from <hi>Watch-makers,</hi> a ballsnce Watch that requireth winding up every 24 Hours, keepeth time more exact, than one that goeth a Week, before it need winding up. About Seven Years ago, my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity carried me to <hi>Greſham Colledge,</hi> when the Aſſembly was ſeated, the <hi>Preſident</hi> told me, they had cauſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Experiments to be made with theſe <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> and thought fitting not to commend them for Common Practice at Sea, for fear that the Errors
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108771:20"/>
that might happen in their uſe, ſhould prove greater then the Errors in the common Practice of Navigation; but now let us handle our Subject a little more cloſely, and ſuppoſe that three or four of the ſaid <hi>Watches</hi> being good work, well made, and carryed to Sea in one <hi>Ship</hi> under the Command of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Men, may prove very uſeful towards the keeping a true Account of a <hi>Ships</hi> way on the Sea, not for finding the <hi>Longitude</hi> from our firſt <hi>Meridian,</hi> but to help to find your difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> every 24 Hours, or every two or three Days, as often as you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Latitude; provided they be not too much tampered with, keeping the Indexes always moving, but never move them with your Fingers, except extraordinary occaſion require it; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not that they ſhould always ſhew you the true time of the Day, (you may if you pleaſe, keep one for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe beſides,) but learn by continuance of time, to find the Motion of each <hi>Watch</hi> in a Year, or in a Month, or Day, and Hour, and having the true Theory of each <hi>Watches</hi> Motion, with their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108771:21"/>
equalities and inequalities, you may by Calculation, find at what time of the Day or Night the Indexes of each <hi>Watch,</hi> (for I ſuppoſe, they may not all move juſt alike,) will point to ſuch or ſuch an Hour, Degree, or Minute, in any <hi>Meridian;</hi> keep them from being hurt by any <hi>Violent Motion,</hi> as falls, or knocking near them; keep them from Winds, from too moiſt <hi>Airs,</hi> and ſtinking <hi>Fumes;</hi> ſuch as are when Salt Water Casks are emptied on <hi>Deck,</hi> or in a Ships Well, where Men have been Stifled; keep them very clean from <hi>Salt Water,</hi> or any <hi>Ruſt</hi> or <hi>Filth;</hi> let there be a place in the <hi>Ship,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly appointed for them, to hang in <hi>Equilibrio.</hi> I find in the Ph. tranſ. N. 47. p. 937.

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of or concerning <hi>Longitude,</hi> by Magnetick <hi>Variation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Variation</hi> of the Compaſs (by which I mean the deflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Needle, from the true <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>) is of that great concernment in the Art of Navigation, that the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thereof does little leſs then render uſeleſs, one of the nobleſt Inventions Mankind ever attain'd to; I deſire the Ingenious Seamen, that the Knowledge of <hi>Magnetick Variation,</hi> may be always in his great Eſteem; for without it, Navigation cannot be perfect. It is my Opinion, that many Ships have been put by their deſign'd Ports, and more Ships loſt for want of knowing the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation,</hi> then hath been loſt for want of the <hi>Longitude;</hi> how many Ships in Sailing from the <hi>South-f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re-land,</hi> to the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> hath been put to the Northward of the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> for want of minding the <hi>Variation?</hi> for the like cauſe, ſome Ships
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108771:22"/>
have miſſed the Iſland <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and met with other diſmal Accidents. Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Wright,</hi> an able Mathematician in his time, in the latter end of his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Errors in <hi>Navigation,</hi> did write concerning the <hi>Haven finding Art,</hi> by the <hi>Variation</hi> of the Marriners Compaſs, but alas he knew nothing of the <hi>Variation</hi> of the <hi>Variation,</hi> or as I call it, of the Increaſe and Decreaſe of the <hi>Variation</hi> in the ſame place; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that part of his Book proved very Erroneous, by ſuppoſing that the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation</hi> at any place, never Altered, now we know better.</p>
               <p>There are many of Opinion at this preſent time, that the <hi>Longitude</hi> may be found by the <hi>Variation</hi> of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Horizontal Needle; I doubt the poſſibility thereof, from our firſt <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> for many parts of the World will afford us no Practicable proportions for the difference of <hi>Variation</hi> between them, according to their diſtance in <hi>Longitude;</hi> nor can the quantity of the Earths Atraction, be eaſily determin'd in all places, beſides the quantity of each <hi>Polar</hi> Atraction, for there are four,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108771:23"/>
at leaſt two, of them lie in the bowels of the Earth, and not in the Air, as Mr. <hi>Pond</hi> ſaith; it is probable that theſe <hi>Magnetick Poles</hi> have a Motion from North to South, but whether they move altogether with one Motion, or with ſeveral; whether equally, or unequally; whether Circular or Libratory; if Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, about what Center? If Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, after what manner, are Secrets as yet unknown to Mankind; That which I call the more proper North <hi>Magnetick Pole,</hi> Predominates at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> and the Period of its motion, as ſome ſay, is about 370 Years; and others write, that the Period of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>American Pole,</hi> is about 700 Years; ſome think the <hi>Magnetical</hi> Inclinatory Needle, always points di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to one of theſe <hi>Poles,</hi> which I dare affirm to be an untruth, and can prove it by Practice, Experience, and Infallible Demonſtrations. The mean Motion of the <hi>Variation</hi> here at <hi>London,</hi> is about eight Minutes, or ſomewhat more in one Year; it is my Opinion, that moſt places in the World, have not altogether ſo ſwift an Alteration of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108771:23"/>
                  <hi>Variation,</hi> as at <hi>London;</hi> but in many other places it is a little ſlower, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially near the Equinoctial; for the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er one of theſe Poles is to any place, there encreaſe or decreaſe of the <hi>Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may be ſwifteſt. As the <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> differs his declination but ſlowly, ſo the Horrizontal <hi>Needle,</hi> is in its ſloweſt Motion, when it hath the greateſt <hi>Variation</hi> Eaſt or Weſt, at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> and whereas ſome places have above 22 or 30 Degrees <hi>Variation</hi> North-Weſterly, I doubt thoſe places will not have above 22 Deg. <hi>Variation,</hi> North-Eaſterly, in one Revolution of the ſaid Poles. That all Magnetical <hi>Needles</hi> well toucht, have the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection exactly, as Mr. <hi>Sellers</hi> hath prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many Experiments, ſee Ph. tr. N. 26. p. 478. but if badly toucht, they may vary ſometimes one or two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from the true <hi>Magnetical Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> as often happens at Sea, as our Marriners ſay, that the Compaſs in the upper or lower beetackle, ſometimes varies near half a point from each other; I have often taken notice of their expreſſions, and tryed to find the cauſe;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108771:24"/>
and when I found no Iron near them, (or the like Obſtructions,) that might draw me off the Compaſſes, I have found that one, and ſometimes both, had a a weak touch, or Old and Ruſty, and good for nothing, except to throw over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Five Hundred ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, I believe, at this preſent writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be found belonging to the <hi>Navy, &amp;c.</hi> A true Knowledge of the <hi>Variation</hi> is very requiſite in keeping a Sea reckoning; it troubles me to think what Ignorant Perſons are <hi>Maſters</hi> of Ships; it is ſcarce two Years ſince, in my company, ſome <hi>Maſters</hi> of Ships, complained of a wrong Courſe ſteered by their <hi>Comodores,</hi> who in the Night by a fair Wind, were carryed too near the Borlings, even ſo near, that ſome of them were oblig'd, (as I was inform'd) to go between the <hi>Borlings</hi> and the <hi>Main.</hi> This Error happened for want of good underſtanding <hi>Maſters</hi> in the <hi>Comodores</hi> Ships, they knew not the <hi>Variation,</hi> elſe forgot to allow for it; for though the true Courſe from the <hi>Lizard</hi> to <hi>Cape Finiſter</hi> be S. S. W. the Courſe to be Steered by Marriners
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108771:24"/>
Compaſs, at preſent, is S. S. W. ½ W. and S. W. by S. It is ſcarce one Year ago, (to this preſent writing,) ſince a <hi>Maſter</hi> of a — Rate Ship told his Captain, that he obſerv'd 14 or 15 Deg. <hi>Variation</hi> about 6 Leagues off of <hi>Malhago</hi> by the Stars, (there is about 6 Deg.) If I may compare a Man to a block, that ſame Man knew little more how to find the <hi>Variation</hi> by the North Star, or any other Star, than a Buggilug or Bracket on that Ships Quarter; I doubt whether or no, he ever ſaw an <hi>Azimuth Compaſs.</hi> When you would obſerve the North Star, to find the <hi>Variation</hi> in the Night, conſider its diſtance Eaſt or Weſt from the <hi>Pole;</hi> a <hi>Nocturnal</hi> may be of good uſe in this Caſe. <hi>England</hi> does not know how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loſſes hath happened for want of a better Knowledge in the <hi>Variation</hi> of the Compaſs through only a Pilot of a Ship: ſuppoie between the Bunt-Head and the K. K. or <hi>Gunfleet,</hi> if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not the <hi>Variation,</hi> he may in my Opinion, as well deſerve a Rope, as a Branch. But the <hi>Extra.</hi>-Pilots will blame me for mentioning <hi>Variation</hi> or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108771:25"/>
Courſe in Pilot Water, where the Strength and Courſe of Tides and depths of Water, is of much more Conſequence. My <hi>Lord's Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty, &amp;c.</hi> You have been pleaſed to give us a Form to keep our <hi>Journals</hi> at Sea; there is in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two Columns wanting in that Form, that Column for <hi>Longitude.</hi> If you pleaſe, my <hi>Lords,</hi> let it be accounted from our firſt <hi>Meridian;</hi> may there be added one Column called <hi>Meridian</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by <hi>plain Chart,</hi> and accounted from the laſt Land ſeen; and another for the <hi>Variation</hi> of the Compaſs. I have belong'd this War to Six ſeveral Rates in the Navy, and never ſaw an <hi>Azimuth Compaſs</hi> Aboard any of them; my Judgment tells me, that every Ship of War, requires at leaſt three ſuch like <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Variation,</hi> though they ride only at an Anchor, at the <hi>Nore,</hi> or in the <hi>Downs;</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Navy have taken Care to provide ſuch <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Maſters</hi> of Men of War, may have them for asking for, (for the <hi>Boatſwains</hi> Indent for them.) I believe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108771:25"/>
they are aſhamed, (or ought to be;) for ſome of them knows not what to do with them; the Inſtruments if well uſed, may be a means to help to ſave a Ship, and Ships Companies lives; they are good to be uſed for the Inſtruction of Ships Company and Youth, there is Education in the <hi>Navy,</hi> (little enough,) that is good: Navigation ſeems to decay, or decline; I wiſh it be not a Crime, for ſome Gentlemen in the <hi>Navy,</hi> to underſtand it. Now I will ſay ſomething to my Honourable <hi>Company Maſters;</hi> little do they know, how many Ships have been loſt for want of a better Knowledge of the <hi>Variation;</hi> I believe I could name ſome, (and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral in great danger by report,) but dare not fear of the <hi>Law:</hi> Captain <hi>William Wildey</hi> underſtood the <hi>Variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> very well in my Opinion, I believe it was almoſt as good to him as the <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> between St. <hi>Hellena,</hi> and any part of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> When I was in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> I underſtood what <hi>Variation</hi> there was in moſt Adjacent Parts ſo well, that I have offered in Diſcourſe in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to go in a Ship that ſet Sail from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108771:26"/>
any part of the Coaſt of <hi>India,</hi> bound any way, two three or four Hundred Leagues, I would keep no Account of her way for a Week or ten Days time, and any fair Day when I could have Reaſonable Obſervations, I would a told them the place where the Ship was, as well as they that kept the moſt exact Reckoning, (almoſt as well, if you pleaſe) provided they had not ſeen the Land ſince I ſaw it; and this I muſt have done by the <hi>Lattitude</hi> and <hi>Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> obſerv'd, <hi>October</hi> the 30th, 1688. in the Offing at <hi>Cape Bona Eſperance,</hi> the Cape bearing from us about North, diſtant 6 or 7 Leagues; the mean <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation</hi> by three <hi>Azimuth Compaſſes,</hi> and Nine Obſervations, was 10° N. Weſterly; the ſame Year, <hi>November</hi> the 16th, <hi>Variation</hi> at St. <hi>Hellena,</hi> 1° 4′ N. Weſterly, the difference is 8° 56′ the the <hi>Meridian</hi> diſtance, by <hi>plain Chart,</hi> is 20°, difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> is 21° 54′, in Sailing directly between the two aforeſaid places we raiſed or layed (Sea Terms,) the <hi>Variation</hi> ſomewhat gradually, therefore having the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Longitude,</hi> and the difference

of the <hi>Variation</hi> given between the two ſaid places, it may be ſuppoſed that the difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the places, may be found by Obſervation of the <hi>Variation;</hi> I anſwer yes, it may be nearly gueſſed at, and I know how to make proportions for finding the difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> by the <hi>Variation,</hi> not only between the two aforeſaid places, but in many other places. But it is a Method I do not approve of, and adviſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Seamen not to uſe it, (except in Caſes of great Neceſſity,) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to learn by former Journals, or from ſome Experienc'd Artiſt, what <hi>Variation</hi> is at ſuch places where you are bound to, and all along your Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as near as you can, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Variation</hi> of the <hi>Variation:</hi> I believe the difference of the <hi>Variation</hi> between any two places in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> may be always near the ſame; and not only there, but in moſt other parts of the World (near the Iſles <hi>Azores</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,) that are not above 20 or 30 Degrees diſtant aſunder; this I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend as a Secret, worthy Obſervation. But there are ſeveral places that will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108771:27"/>
not allow of any proportions like the former; as the <hi>Downs,</hi> the Chanel of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeveral Degrees Weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhant;</hi> there is but little difference in the <hi>Variation</hi>: The <hi>Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> alſo alters apace in Sailing N. or S. under the ſame <hi>Meridian,</hi> not always gradually, but in ſome places faſter then in others. It is found by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Practice, that the Morning <hi>Variations</hi> are the greateſt, as I have found ſometimes near 30 Minutes; and my Opinion is, that this difference happeneth not from the Oval Form, or Eliptical Motion of the Earth, but that the Suns <hi>Refraction</hi> is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly greateſt in a Morning; if the Suns greateſt <hi>Refraction</hi> be but 34′ as our Aſtronomers affirm; how came it to paſs, that ſome <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> that Wintered in <hi>Green-land,</hi> and <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> ſaw the Sun five Days ſooner then was expected, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Latitude of the place; but to prevent the former difference or Error, ſubſtract the Suns <hi>Refraction</hi> from the obſerved Altitude, allowing the <hi>Refraction,</hi> when the Sun is in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108771:27"/>
Horizon, to be a few Minutes more in a Morning; then in the Evening; I cannot at preſent Certifie you how many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes the difference is, becauſe I have loſt my former Amplitudal Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is a Fault in our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Commanders, that they have not uſed to Subſtract the Suns <hi>Refraction, &amp;c.</hi> (they commonly take the Suns Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the preceeding Noon, which is alſo a great Fault.) <hi>Vide Aſtr. Ang.</hi> page 94. <hi>Tabula Refractionum Triplex.</hi> But near the Poles it is probable, the Suns <hi>Refraction</hi> is greater, then near the Equinoctial: If the <hi>Variation</hi> of the Compaſs were better known, and Tables of the <hi>Variation,</hi> for all the moſt noted parts in the World, as Headlands, Capes, Iſlands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Tables Calculated to a certain Year, becauſe of the Increaſe and Decreaſe of the <hi>Variation,</hi> and the difference of the <hi>Variation,</hi> between thoſe places; then the Knowledge thereof: would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as good as the <hi>Longitude</hi> known, (ſome few places excepted,) and if there be 10 or 20 Years difference, in laying or ſetting down the <hi>Variation</hi> in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108771:28"/>
ſome places, it matters not, provided the Year be ſet down, when the <hi>Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was ſo much at ſuch places, and whether <hi>Increaſing</hi> or <hi>Decreaſing,</hi> as for Example; ſuppoſe in the Year 1708, one ſhould happen to be 10 or 12 Leagues South, off of C. B. <hi>Eſperance,</hi> and find the <hi>Variation</hi> 12° 28′ as I told you before, the difference of the <hi>Variation</hi> between the ſaid <hi>Cape</hi> and St. <hi>Hellena,</hi> is 8° 56′ by which Rule, when you are at the ſaid <hi>Cape,</hi> you may know what the <hi>Variation</hi> is at St. <hi>Hellena, viz.</hi> 3° 32′ both N. Weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, increaſing; the like Examples may be conſider'd of moſt other places in the World, that are not above 20 or 30° diſtant aſunder, (except about the <hi>Azores.</hi>) I preſent you with another Method, <hi>viz.</hi> When we have ſuch or ſuch <hi>Variation</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> thereby to know what <hi>Variation</hi> there is in any other part of the World; for if at this preſent writing, I know exactly what <hi>Variation</hi> there was in all parts of the World, I believe it would be no hard matter then by knowing the <hi>Variation</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> to find what <hi>Variation</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:108771:28"/>
there was in other parts, in future Ages. This Method I recommend to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Ingenious, as alſo to ſee, if they can find the <hi>Lattitude</hi> and <hi>Longitude</hi> of each <hi>Magnetick Pole;</hi> but ſome People with think, I have writ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, if I do not tell them wherefore there is little or no <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation</hi> about the <hi>Azores;</hi> the quantity of the Earths Attraction, is but little in ſome places, two Degrees or three, may be the moſt, and in moſt places at Sea, the more ſolid parts of the Earth, have no Attractive quality, for then the Needle is without the Command of the more <hi>Magnetick</hi> Vigor of the Earth, as for Example, in the Year 1688, about 8 or 10 Leagues at Sea, in the Offing at C. B. <hi>Eſperance,</hi> when we had about Ten Deg. <hi>Variation.</hi> I was told by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Artiſts, that there was not above 7½ or 8 Deg. at moſt <hi>Variation</hi> Aſhoar, or in the Harbour at the <hi>Cape,</hi> which is a very quick Alteration, for any where thereabouts, above Ten Leagues off at Sea, in Sailing on any point of the Compaſs, 10 Leagues, you will not alter your <hi>Variation</hi> above 12
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108771:29"/>
or 14 Minutes at moſt: The like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment hath been proved on the Coaſt of <hi>India,</hi> and in the <hi>Meriterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> Therefore it is evident, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories, Capes, and Head-lands, draw the Compaſs a little, and that only when you are near them, within 10 or 12 Leagues; beſides the Earths quality of hindering it from pointing to its <hi>Poles;</hi> there are four <hi>Poles</hi> (at leaſt) which have a Sympathetical Virtue, with the <hi>Magnetical Needle,</hi> to which it naturally inclines; two of them that are furtheſt within the Earths Orb, I call its more <hi>proper Poles,</hi> and the other two in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Earth, the <hi>Magnetical Poles;</hi> theſe four <hi>Poles</hi> draw the <hi>Needle,</hi> ſome one way, and ſome another, ſo that they hold it amongſt them, each requires a ſhare; but that <hi>Pole</hi> Predominates moſt, to which it is neareſt: The Iſles of <hi>Azores</hi> I account lies almoſt between the two <hi>proper Poles,</hi> which two <hi>Poles</hi> always (for ought I know,) bear N. and S. from thoſe Iſlands, for there it is without the Attraction of the <hi>Magnetick Poles;</hi> but I believe there is ſome <hi>Variation</hi> at the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108771:29"/>
                  <hi>Azores,</hi> and will be more in time. If the <hi>Magnetick Needle</hi> were very high up in the Air, it would have no reſpect to the Earth, or to any <hi>Poles</hi> but its own, or <hi>Center;</hi> this is my Opinion. The cauſe of the quick Alteration, and great <hi>Variation,</hi> at <hi>New-found-land,</hi> and ſome other places; I would alſo tell you my Opinion, but I am afraid of ſeeming tedious, with Tautologies.</p>
               <p>In uſing <hi>Azimut Compaſſes,</hi> take care the <hi>Chart</hi> Librate well in the Box, and that the point of the Braſs Needle, on which the <hi>Chart</hi> Librates, be as exact as may be, in its proper place or <hi>Center</hi> of the Box; truſt not to one Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when you can have the Medium of 5 or 6 or more, nor to one Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, when you may have the mean of 3 or 4 <hi>Azimuths;</hi> mind to ſubſtract the Suns <hi>Refraction, &amp;c.</hi> Suffer no great Guns, or other Iron, too near your Compaſſes; thoſe are beſt that have the quickeſt <hi>Motion,</hi> you may try the points of the Needle, by ſeeing what Iron they will take up, but be very careful, and uſe it not often, for you may ſpoil the <hi>Needle.</hi> With a Needle
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108771:30"/>
and round <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> may be perfom'd many Natural and pleaſant Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but to think, that ſuch a <hi>Terrula,</hi> (as they call it,) hath or repreſents the like <hi>Magnetick</hi> Force or Power, in all Species as the Earth, is a weak and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Opinion; whereas it may be thought in theſe parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> there is no occaſion for carrying <hi>Azimuth Compaſſes</hi> to Sea, becauſe it may be ſuppoſed moſt <hi>Maſters,</hi> knows what <hi>Variation</hi> there is in moſt Adjacent places; it is a miſtake, for the Major part, nay ⅔ of them, I believe, knows little or nothing concerning it, as I could prove by manifeſt Examples; If I were to declare what I know, and ſometimes been an Eye witneſs to; but Truth ought not to be ſpoke at all times; beſides, I am not willing to diſoblidge ſome Perſons, that might think I reflect too much on them; thoſe <hi>Maſters</hi> that have underſtood ſomething of the <hi>Variation,</hi> often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, for want of <hi>Azimuth Compaſſes,</hi> or for not being obliged to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof: I have known ſome <hi>Maſters</hi> of Ships, that knew, (by hear
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108771:30"/>
ſay from others,) that in ſuch places, there was about half a Point Weſt <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation:</hi> I have asked them how they accounted it from what point of the Compaſs, (pretending my ſelf Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,) they have anſwered, I might Account it from N. or S. E. or W. or from any point, it was always Weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; neither do they know how to eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the <hi>Variation</hi> in their Reckonings; but it may be objected, how can the <hi>Maſters</hi> be ſo Ignorant, that go and come well from Port to Port; I anſwer <hi>Thickie, Weſt-Country-Man, lock zure, Life and Soul Man, can carry a Ship to</hi> New-found-land <hi>zure, and near a word a Book zure;</hi> this is by long Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Cuſtom, not by Art; I have ſeen the Blind lead the Blind a Begging; I knew two Blind Men in <hi>Cochin,</hi> that would go very readily to any Houſe in that Town, and I have ſent one of them an Errand two Miles into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but they were both born Blind; therefore by long Experience and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, they naturally know moſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent places. As to <hi>Maſters</hi> or <hi>Pilots,</hi> their carrying Ships in and out of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108771:31"/>
and for the Coaſting part, (when they can ſee the Land,) I have nothing to ſay againſt them: And if a miſchance happens, you will rarely find any of them without a lying Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to ſalve their Ignorance. But it may be ſaid, the <hi>Maſters</hi> make Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and keep a Reckoning, yes, ſo they do, and a very bad one often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. I will acquaint you how they do, that knows not how to allow for the <hi>Variation,</hi> as they ought; it is likely they can tell, whether they have Sailed between the <hi>South</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or S. and W. or N. and E. or N. or W. having wrought their Days Work by Log and difference. Lattitude and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, they find what diſt. the Ship hath run by Log. ſo having that diſt. and diff. Lattitude by Obſervation, they can find, (as they think,) the <hi>Departure,</hi> without allowing for <hi>Variation;</hi> and this kind of Reckoning, is the cauſe of ſo many great Miſtakes, in their Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Weſting; for the Log. is but a falſe ſuppoſition, to find the diſtance run, as hath been Experienc'd in one Fleet, where ſome have had 70 Miles
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108771:31"/>
on the board, ſome 80, and others about 90, the ſame 24 Hours, and all the while, not above a League aſunder. Now I will acquaint you with the beſt known Common Method, for keeping an Account of a Ships way on the Sea. Be as curious as poſſibly you can, in obſerving the Suns <hi>Meridian Altitude,</hi> or for want thereof, ſome known <hi>Stars</hi> to find the <hi>Lattitude</hi> by; if you obſerve with <hi>Davis's Quadrant,</hi> ſee your <hi>Vanes</hi> very carefully and exactly placed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Shade <hi>Vane;</hi> when the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon</hi> is very clear, obſerve ſomewhat cloſe, when hazy a little more open; theſe cautions I give, that you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve every Day alike, and thereby the better to Judge of your true difference of Latitude by Obſervation, then work your Days work, and find what Courſe the Ship hath made, as near as poſſibly you can find it, by allowing for <hi>Lee-way Variation, &amp;c.</hi> (or lying by, or any other Impediments, as Tides or Currents, or a great Sea,) and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true diff. Latitude by Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the Courſe given, you may eaſily find the diſtance run, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108771:32"/>
by the common Method, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Longitude by <hi>Mercator, &amp;c.</hi> It is my Opinion, that the uſe of the <hi>Log.</hi> is good to help to find the Ships Courſe, though there are ſome able Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts that uſe no <hi>Log.</hi> but now to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe again, as for Mr. <hi>Bond's Longitude found,</hi> (as he called it) he limits his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to the City of <hi>London,</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf (as he had a great deal of Reaſon,) that the ſame <hi>Calculus</hi> is not ſufficient for other places, whereby it appears, that his Rule is far ſhort, of the ſo much deſired general one.

as yet ſo exact in any <hi>Almanack</hi> or <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> that tells us the true time of the <hi>Moons Southing,</hi> in any <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> without Error. Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> writes, that from the Error of one Minute of an Hour in the <hi>Moons motion</hi> from the <hi>Sun</hi> ariſeth an Error of 7° 12′ in the <hi>Longitude</hi> of the place propounded, and in the motion of the ſame <hi>Moon,</hi> from any fixed <hi>Star,</hi> riſeth an Error of 6° 48′ and moreover (he ſaith,) it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if the Errors of both places be not of the ſame Denomination, and leſſer then one Minute of time; the Error of <hi>Longitude</hi> cannot be leſs then then 13° <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Moons</hi> mean motion being but 13° 10′ 35″ is little in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to 360° therefore the two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are very conſiderable; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as I am a Favourer of the <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> by the <hi>Moons motion,</hi> I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſolve one Objection, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe how the other may be ſolved; then as to the firſt, I anſwer, that I know how to find the true time (when we can have Reaſonable Obſervations) of the Day or Night, to one or two ſeconds of time; and if I Err 4 or 5
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108771:36"/>
ſeconds, it matters not, others may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve as true as I, if they be careful; in the Practick part of Navigation, it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often happens, that one Error Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects another, as for Example: Suppoſe we Err 4 or 5 Minutes in the Lattitude, 2 or 3 Minutes in the Suns R. A. (or Dec. in the Day time,) 3 or 4 Min. in the Stars R. A. and about as many in its Altitude; it is ten to one odds, but theſe Errors, (if not much greater,) will ſo help to <hi>Correct</hi> one another, that you will come very near the true time of the Day or Night; and what <hi>Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> will truſt to one Obſervation, when he can have the mean of 6 or 8 Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; I account him an Ignorant Obſerver, that Errs above 10 or 12 ſeconds of Time, Day or Night; truſt not to Mr. <hi>Seller's, Colſon's, Norwood's, Newton's</hi> Tables of the Suns R.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108771:37"/>
falſe; it is not long ago ſince Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Street</hi> lived amongſt us, who ſaid (as I have been informed,) that he was capable to perfect the Theory of the <hi>Moons</hi> motion, ſo that her place might be as truly found by Calculation, as any of the reſt of the <hi>Planets,</hi> if he had Encouragement; 'twas ten thouſand pities he had not, but ſuch is our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Ingratitude.

I may be capable to Practiſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others in the Practick part of <hi>Longitude</hi> at Sea; or the Ingenious may put it to Practice, without my further Aſſiſtance: Tables of the <hi>Moons place, right Aſcenſion,</hi> and <hi>Declination,</hi> would be pleaſing Eaſie, and more Intelligible to our Seamen, if they be truly Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for Noon or Midnight, in our firſt Meridian: But I think I can find as great Objections, as either of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108771:37"/>
former; it is very difficult to contrive an Inſtrument (uſeful at Sea,) for tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moons true diſtance, from fixed <hi>Stars,</hi> for if you Err but one Minute of motion in the diſtance, it will produce an Error of about 28′ in <hi>Longitude;</hi> and if the Stars place which you take your diſtances from, happen to be one or two Minutes falſe, the Error will be ſo much the greater; alſo Idleneſs is the root of Ignorance, and many other Evils: Our Mathematick <hi>School-maſters,</hi> that Teach Navigation, moſt of their Schollars when they come to Sea, are half to begin again; a Seaman hath much Night-work, as well as Day-work, it is convenient to go to School at Nights, to learn to know the <hi>Stars,</hi> how to find the time of the Night by Obſervation, and how to find the <hi>Moons</hi> place by Obſervation, I mean to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it, for Examples are beſt Precepts; many able Mathematicians have writ concerning finding the <hi>Longitude</hi> by the <hi>Moons Eclipſes,</hi> concerning which, you may find many Examples in <hi>Ph. tranſ.</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> as alſo in a new <hi>Syſtem</hi> of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> by Sir

                  <hi>Jonas More,</hi> in the Doctrine of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> to which I refer you.

may be found <hi>Geometrically,</hi> by Scale and Compaſſes; or on large Maps of the fixed Stars; firſt, knowing her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from any two known Stars in that Map; but an eaſier way is, if we could contrive an Inſtrument to take her difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> from any fixed <hi>Star,</hi> at one diſtance, which I think not impoſſible, eſpecially when ſhe is near the <hi>Meridian,</hi> or <hi>Nonageſima,</hi> and then is the beſt time of Obſerving. <hi>Illuminatio Lunae per Solem.</hi> ſee Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> his <hi>Atlas Coeleſtis,</hi> in the Figure taken from <hi>P.

and the 4th, when the <hi>Satelles</hi> dips in the ſhadow of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſo as that the <hi>firſt Satelles,</hi> within the ſpace of 7 Days, doth effect 16 <hi>Eclipſes;</hi> the ſecond 8, the third, 4; ſo that all of them together, produce 28 <hi>Eclipſes;</hi> the fourth, after that he hath reached the <hi>Nodes,</hi> doth make 4 <hi>Eclipſes</hi> in 17 Days; but when near his bounds, he never ſuffers a defect of his <hi>Light,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his <hi>Latitude</hi> is ſo large, that he never touches the Rim of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or reacheth his ſhadow. Theſe <hi>Eclipſes</hi> are of great uſe, in order to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of the <hi>Longitudes</hi> of places. <hi>Le Grand</hi>'s <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> But the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for our purpoſe, is only the Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Emerſion of the Satellites, in the Verge of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Shade. Many there are who prefer this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> before others; becauſe the Satellites of <hi>Jupiter</hi> have no ſenſible <hi>Parallax;</hi> and in every poſition of <hi>Jupiter</hi> above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> (in the Night, when <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> permits,) are conveniently to be obſerved, with a <hi>Teleſcope</hi> of 12 or 15 Foot long, a fine danceing Inſtrument indeed at Sea, eſpecially in a Gale of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108771:42"/>
                  <hi>Wind,</hi> (then not manageable,) to look through a <hi>Tube</hi> of 15 or 18 Foot long, which hath only <hi>two Glaſſes</hi> in it; and I have been troubled at Sea, to find an <hi>Object</hi> with a <hi>Perſpective</hi> of 1 Foot and a half long, which hath only <hi>two Glaſſes</hi> in it; therefore at Sea, for the better finding an Object, we commonly uſe <hi>Teleſcopes</hi> with 3 or 4 Glaſſes in them, of three or four Foot long, (the <hi>Teleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copes</hi>) through which I have often look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but never could ſee his <hi>Satellites</hi> through one of that length; and what muſt we do for the <hi>Longitude,</hi> when <hi>Jupiter</hi> riſes and ſets <hi>Coſmically</hi> or <hi>Acronically,</hi> as in <hi>September,</hi> this Year: but we will ſuppoſe the beſt, that the Weather ſhould be ſo fair, and Sea ſmooth, that we may poſſibly get Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations two or three times in a Month, indeed it would be a very great help and ſatisfaction to us, if the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations proved good. Mr. <hi>Colſon,</hi> an able <hi>Mathematick</hi> Teacher, told me, he had near one Hundred Obſervation by him, made at Sea, with a Teleſcope of 6 Foot long, which he contriv'd with a convenient apparatus, for manageing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108771:43"/>
it. I have one 5 Foot long, in which I have ſeen the <hi>Satellites;</hi> keep your Glaſſes very clean, eſpecially the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Glaſs, from Miſts or Dews. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know what we ſhall do for Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Satellites, for Years to come, (always for four Years at leaſt,) Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> in his <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> hath inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Catalogue of the Eclipſes of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Satellites viſible, under the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the Obſervatory, (I ſuppoſe he means the King's Obſervatory in <hi>Greenwich-Park,</hi>) or near it in the Year 1696. But what muſt they do for ſuch Tables every Year, that are in the Weſt and <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> a late Author in his <hi>Book</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1695, hath inſerted two Years Tables for the time paſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 1693 and 1694. borrowed perhaps out of ſome old <hi>Ephemeris;</hi> it is well he ſaid ſomething of the time paſt, its likely he knew little or nothing of what was to come; yet ſome of our able <hi>Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> revile and reflect on our Seamens Ignorance, becauſe the Seamen, (as they ſay,) cannot find the <hi>Longitude,</hi> Indeed I think our Seamen have moſt cauſe to rail at our <hi>Mathematicians,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:108771:43"/>
that have done nothing, (as I know of,) to any purpoſe, for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Improvement of Navigation, for almoſt 20 Years paſt, (except a <hi>Tide Table,</hi>) as I ſhall prove by <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>'s <hi>Practical</hi> Navigation, the moſt uſeful <hi>Book</hi> for Seamen yet extant, and the Impreſſion worſe now, then it was almoſt 20 Year ago; compare the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Suns place and <hi>Declination,</hi> in the 7th Edition of the <hi>Practical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,</hi> with Tables of the Suns place and Declination in <hi>Parkers Ephemeris,</hi> for this Year, and you will find conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable difference; and that the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> was better 18 or 20 Years ago, I prove by <hi>Pag.</hi> 330, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Table</hi> of the <hi>Variation</hi> of the Suns <hi>Declination,</hi> to be applied for Years to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the <hi>Tables</hi> were the ſame, as in <hi>Anno</hi> 1680, or thereabouts, we might by the ſaid Table of <hi>Variation,</hi> have Corrected the Tables of the <hi>Suns Declination,</hi> but there is impoſed on us, new dates of Years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The aforeſaid <hi>Book</hi> wants Correction very much; there is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it a larger <hi>Table</hi> of difference of <hi>Latitude</hi> and <hi>departure,</hi> ſuch a one as is

I will conclude this Chapter with the following words, which I take, to be the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Flamſtead's, viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As by <hi>Lunar Eclipſes,</hi> ſo alſo by the Eclipſes of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Satellites, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the obſerved Moments of the Occultation or Emerſion of a Satellite from his ſhadow, noted carefully in two
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108771:45"/>
diſtant places, will be the difference of Meridians, betwixt theſe two places in time; but I cannot hope that this Method ſhall prove of much uſe to the Ingenious Seamen, becauſe the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations require long <hi>Teleſcopes,</hi> which in a Ship will hardly be manageable; nor can we expect to find the difference of Meridians, by one only Obſervation of a Satellite Eclipſe, as we have hopes we may by a <hi>Lunar,</hi> by reaſon that as yet, the inequality of their motions, and the time required for the tranſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Light from the Planet to our Earth are unknown; nay, their mean motions are ſcarce ſo exactly ſtated, but that we may Juſtly ſuſpect them Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous; omitting theſe therefore, the beſt Method for the diſcovery of the <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> will be in my Opinion, (I am du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, he is now of another Opinion,) by the Moons Apulſes to, or obſerved diſtances from fixed Stars, upon which Accoun I would recommend the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and Correction of her Theory, with the Doctrine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Apulſes, to the Study of the Ingenious Aſtronomer and Seamen.

               <p>
                  <hi>OMnia probate, quod bonum eſt tenete.</hi> That which I have written in this <hi>Book,</hi> I deſigned for the publick good of Mankind; in which I hope I have not offended God. If any Arts or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, Commerce or Trade, be Good and Juſt in their kind, then what I have writ concerning <hi>Longitude,</hi> is Good and Juſt in its kind, that is, if it be not Abuſed: Though there was an Officer in the <hi>Navy,</hi> (as I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) who Curſed and Damn'd the Man that ſhould diſcover the <hi>Longitude;</hi> thou Old, Inveterate, Ruſty, Muſty, Filthy, Cankered, Carnal Devil, for Curſing down upon thy Marrow-bones, (if thou haſt any,) and ask God Almighty forgiveneſs for thy Sins, know that it it is not in thy Power to Damn any Man but thy ſelf: God who ſuffered the Earth to be Inhabited by Angels,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108771:46"/>
for an infinite number of Ages, before he Created <hi>Adam,</hi> and then expelling them hence for their Wickedneſs, and turning them to Devils, gave this Globe for a dwelling place to Men; grant that the enormous Crimes of Mortals, may not provoke him to Exterminate our Humane Race, and reſtore the Devils to their Antient Habitations, <hi>Tur. Spy. Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>Pag.</hi> 359.</p>
               <p>But as for that one Man, (I doubt there is more ſuch,) aforeſaid, I believe He did not ſpeak it then out of Ill-will to me, but to ſome other Perſon, or rather raſhly or unawares; I believe his meaning at that time was, that this ungrateful World did not deſerve ſo great a Bleſſing, or ſo worthy a Science. I am thinking what my Country will be pleaſed to ſay of me, if they call me <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> I give very little Credit to <hi>Judicial Aſtrology,</hi> nor do I profeſs any ſuch deceitful lying Arts; if <hi>Maggoty,</hi> its an Expreſſion for <hi>Fools,</hi> and their bolt is ſoon ſhot; if <hi>Star-Gazer,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, a <hi>Star-Gazer</hi> is better then a <hi>Booby;</hi> ſome may Envy me, ſome Laugh and Scoff at me, (a common
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108771:47"/>
Method to ſolve their own Ignorance,) others Mock and Ridicule me; ſo our Predeceſſors did at <hi>Columbus,</hi> when he came hither to offer them the diſcovery of the World, and ought not they to have been Recorded for F — s, as (ſome ſay,) the <hi>Pope</hi> was, that <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Scraſburg,</hi> for writing of <hi>Antipodes.</hi> But now I think on't, I have a reſerve which they are not like to know yet a while. As I have heard ſay, the <hi>Venetians</hi> have offered Rewards; the States of <hi>Holland</hi> (as I was informed,) ſome Years ago, took this Science ſo much into their Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that they offered Ten Thouſand Pounds, to any Man that was capable to diſcover it; <hi>Thomas Axe,</hi> an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, left a Legacy of One Thouſand Pound, (never to be paid I think,) to any Perſon that ſhould diſcover the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,</hi> within the ſpace of Ten Years after his Deceaſe, if his Wife and Child died Childleſs in that time; beſides, it is to be approved of by the four Profeſſors of Geometry and Aſtronomy, in <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for the time being, and at leaſt twenty Experienc'd
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108771:47"/>
Maſters of Ships, that ſhall have made ſeveral Experiments thereof in long Voyages. Affidavits are to be made before the Twelve Judges of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> He dyed in the year 1691, and I think took care enough, that the ſaid one Thouſand Pound ſhould be Irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable; indeed, I have little better Opinion of either the <hi>Venetian</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Gratuities; States may be miſtaken in their Policies; God Almighty never ordained that this Science ſhould be well known to the World, by fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means, but if their deſigns be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, (as you may ſuppoſe,) where is the Encouragement? I know not how to recover my Coſt and Charges, though I have laid (and ſhall the reſt by and by,) moſt of the ground work at my Charge; where is the Money to raiſe and perfect the Work? There is — Pounds wanting, preſent Pay, towards the Charge of making two wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſtruments, for the firſt making of the Inſtrument, will be very Chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; one of them may prove far more chargeable then the other, and yet when it becomes common, it may be ſold at
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108771:48"/>
a low Price, I Judge under fifty Shill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; yet before the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> can be brought to ſuch Perfection, as to ſhow two or three <hi>Examples,</hi> may coſt ſeveral Hundreds of Pounds, and for ought I know, take up moſt part of a Year, to accompliſh them, it is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> that muſt be truly Cut and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, a ſmall matter of a falſe ſweep or ſtroke may quite ſpoil it, and make it good for little or nothing; therefore one Hundred of them may happen to be ſpoiled before we can get the right Art of making them; neither of them will ſuddenly be fit for Seamens Practiſe, becauſe the <hi>Natural motions</hi> that one of them is to ſhow, are at this preſent writing, I believe, unknown to the World; therefore reaſonable time is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to Calculate the <hi>Theories</hi> of thoſe <hi>motions.</hi> I will give you a brief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of one of the <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> it is one or two, I know not well which to call it, it is round, its Diameter about 8 or 10 Inches, may be a good ſize, it is not altogether <hi>flat</hi> nor <hi>Convex,</hi> nor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave,</hi> nor <hi>Globular,</hi> it contains ſeveral Circles exactly ſwept even, to a Hairs
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108771:48"/>
breadth, the <hi>Areas</hi> of each Circle, muſt have their juſt proportions, but have no viſible point for a Center, nor are the Circles Cut and raked in its <hi>Surface,</hi> but ought to appear above it; it hath no ſtraight Lines, ſave only in its <hi>Frame</hi> of — which muſt be divided into 360 Deg. and ſubdivided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is <hi>Scioptrick, Dioptrick, Catoptrick,</hi> P — S. —K. and P.—H —K. and whereas moſt Secrets ſeem moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful before they are diſcovered; this Inſtrument will ſeem moſt wonderful, when the beſt <hi>Deſcription</hi> is given of it, and when put to common uſe; to give a true and perfect Deſcription of its ſecret properties, like the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> may puzzle the <hi>Oxonian Sophiſt,</hi> or Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian <hi>Sorboniſt;</hi> but this I give for one <hi>Aphoriſm, Natura nil agit fruſtra;</hi> I hope it may anſwer our deſigns in the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, niſi Argentum agit fruſtra;</hi> but all is in the Power of God; it is an Emblem of <hi>Trinity, Trinity</hi> in <hi>Vnity,</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> in <hi>Trinity.</hi> Indeed I have but little more Knowledge of it, then is in the Idea of my Brain, for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental part is moſt wanting, but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108771:49"/>
the World may believe, that I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſound Principles and Evinceing Arguments for my Opinion, elſe I ſhould not have made it ſo publick; delays are dangerous, <hi>Ars longa, Vita brevis;</hi> but if it pleaſe God, I ſhould be glad to live to ſee this Art come to ſuch Perfection, as to be fit for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Practice, during the natural Courſe of my Life. <hi>Reader,</hi> believe if you pleaſe, that he that writ this, could a writ more, and more to the purpoſe, if he would; I think it enough for five or ſix Weeks Time and Study, and abundance too much, if for a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, I may ſuck my Paw, or only my labour for my Pains; future Ages may be more Competent <hi>Judges,</hi> but my Mind will be eaſier when this Book is Publiſhed, becauſe therein I have done my Duty, and eaſed the burden of my Brain. If in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> have ſeemed to reflect on any Perſon, it is my <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> I deſire their Excuſe; I Envy no Men: Envy and Ingratitude, is moſt natural to ſome, whoſe Duty it is to underſtand theſe things and their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, cannot reach them. If any
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108771:49"/>
Perſon is minded, or can, or will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to Correct or Amend what I have writ, I wiſh them good ſucceſs; I deſire them to own what they borrow, and not to reflect without juſt cauſe; it is difficult to write ſuch a <hi>Book</hi> as this is, (I think it is the firſt of this nature,) without Faults; it is likely I my ſelf may find ſome in a Years time, that if I were to write over again, I could amend; I dare affirm, that this Book contains ſome eſtimable Expreſſions and Methods, fit for Seamens Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Practiſe, and ſuch as have not been formerly Publiſhed; there are ſome Perſons in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Duty it is (being paid for it,) to improve <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> and from whom much is expected, and little or nothing of purpoſe appears.</p>
               <p>It is my Opinion, that the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Comets may be found by Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, if any Perſon capable, think it worthy his trouble. Concerning this Book, the common Vogue will be, <hi>viz. but will it do,</hi> is it the <hi>Longitude,</hi> I ſay? Yes, it is the <hi>Longitude</hi> begun, and will do with <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Encouragement,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:108771:50"/>
elſe not; for it is contrary to <hi>Seamens</hi> Vulgar ſayings, that when the <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> is found, then there will be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Artiſts,</hi> Navigation will be ſo eaſie: No, no, Navigation will not be ſo eaſie at preſent, but much more certain and true. The Learned <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaid, the <hi>Longitude</hi> was worth a Kingdom to a Wiſe Man; but before I conclude, to return to my <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> the Deſcription I have given thereof, availeth little, without my further aſſiſtance; till then, the Reader if he pleaſeth may compare—to <hi>Foxes</hi> ſtaring on Bunches of ripe <hi>Gripes,</hi> and cannot get at them; then they are too ſowr for them: for ſo my <hi>Dream</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth, when I was among a Crowd of <hi>Foxes,</hi> aw'd at my Preſence, and after I had looked on them, they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and left me other Objects. The moſt Ingenious of Humane Inventions, is far leſs facile then the ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of Truth and Nature. I love my King, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and my Country, and I thank my God, I know my ſelf capable and worthy to ſerve them, though too much debaſed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108771:50"/>
for want of Friends in Court. If this meet with its deſerved Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the reſt may follow in good time; but I muſt make haſte and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, my attendance and dependance being required in our <hi>Navy Royal,</hi> which Duty, I dare not neglect, for fear of being <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> or which is as bad, Excluded from Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Quamvis bene merenti.</hi>
