            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

THE Sound of a Voyce uttered forth From the MOUNTAINE Of the LORD OF HOST, (WHICH He hath exalted and ſet on the top of all the Hills and Mountains that have been exalted above it) to awaken the Inhabitants of the Earth out of the deep ſleep of ſecurity, which hath by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Light, fell upon them in this dark night of Apoſtacy, wherein thick darkneſs hath cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the earth as the waters cover the Sea, and groſs darkneſs the people, by the which they have been kept in ſlavery and bondage by the power of darkneſs in their own particulars, and by the yielding themſelves ſervants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto are held in Captivity. And alſo a Warning to them from the Lord for to repent, and ſpeedily to return, before his indignation, and the Vials of his fierce wrath break forth, &amp; there be no Remedy.</p>
            <p>By one that is paſſed from death to life, from under the power of darkneſs, which ruled over life, in the time of barrenneſs, and in the land of drought: With a few words of his paſſage and travel in and through the work of Regeneration; and alſo the falſity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the deceivers of this preſent Age and Generation: with a Call unto them that are followers of them and their abominations, to return and be ſeparated from them, in words, wayes and works: For the Lords controverſie is with them and all that take their part. By one that the Lord hath ſeparated from them, and his companions that followed their pernicious wayes, and hath viewed them over, and weighed them in the juſt Ballance, and meaſured them in an even meaſure, and they are all found too light and wanting, and deſolate of the Life of God; and now is ſatisfied with the enjoyment of the preſence of the Lord who through Judgment was redeemed, and now hath a ſure habitation and a peaceable dwelling where none can make afraid; Glory and praiſes be to the Lord my Redeemer, which liveth and abideth for ever. <hi>William Greere.</hi>

            <head>The Sound of a Voyce uttered forth from the Mountain of the Lord of Hoſt, to awaken the Inhabitants of the earth out of the deep ſleep of ſecurity.</head>
            <p>THe mighty God of power of Heaven and of Earth is riſen and ariſing, yea he is come and coming forth as a man of Warre, whoſe countenance is as the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Lyon out of the thicket, uttering his Voyce through the clouds, and through the groſs darkneſs that covers the face of the earth, yea he is come forth as a Lyon to his prey, to tear and to rend, to divide and to ſcatter his enemies from the ends of the earth, to root out and utterly deſtroy, yea to turn and to overturn and overwhelm the wicked and the ungodly, and thoſe his enemies that riſe up againſt him as bryars and thorns to the battel, the which he will burn up and conſume with the fire of his Jealouſie, and with the breath of his mouth, and the brightneſs of his Coming, and conſound them in their counſels, and in their plottings and contrivings, and deſtroy their likeneſſes and images, and diſperce them in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations; the Eaſt-wind ſhall blow upon them and blaſt them in their budding forth, and in the opening of their bloſſome.</p>
            <p>And now hear and fear you that are ſtriving with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and fighting againſt his witneſs in you, Oh return and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to that which is pure in you, to that which makes manifeſt ſin and iniquity, and ſheweth unto every individual man and woman the thoughts and intents of their hearts; and as there is a waiting in it, and a giving up to the leadance and guidance of it, it will make known the way of life, and the path of peace, and give power to walk therein: For this I have known, and as in the preſence of the Lord do teſtifie, That it was the Light that ſhone in my heart, that gave me the Light
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94455:2"/>
of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, and made manifeſt unto me the Will of my heavenly Father, and alſo gave me power to obey; and this cauſed me to depart from iniquity, for the which I was hated and held in deriſion by thoſe that formerly was my companions in ſporting and playing in vanity; and when I could not for C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nſcience ſake joyn with them in thoſe things which before time I had done, but was conſtrain'd to forſake them and their ungodly wayes, and turned unto him that ſmote me and wounded me within exceedingly, and brought my bad actions to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and ſet my faults in order before me, the which cauſed me often times bitterly to lament and to bewail the day that I was born; his judgments fell ſo heavy upon me, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I wiſhed that I had never been. For he made me to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the ſins of my youth; but when I in meaſure came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them as they was made manifeſt, then I to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions became a taunt and a by-word, and was called a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> and at me they ſet their mouths away. And thus for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from iniquity I became a prey; and ſo the miniſtration of condemnation unto all that in me which was contrary unto God in my own particular, I knew and witneſſed, the which condemned me for ſwearing, and for all vain words and idle communication, and in a word, for all manner of evill: and this made me often to refrain from all thoſe things before mentioned; and this cauſed me to fit ſolentary, and to mourn as a woman that was ſeparated from her husband, for enjoying of his preſence outwardly, upon whom widowhood was come: And ſo I being ſeparated from all thoſe things which I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was related to, and ſtood as one naked before the Lord, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given up into his will; and this was my deſire, that a clean ſeparation might be made in me, between the precious and the vile: And this was glorious in its time, and a voyce oftentimes cryed thorow me, <hi>Give up, Give up, that which is for the Famine to the Famine, and that which was for the Sword to the Sword &amp; to yield up that to the death which was to dye,</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o that which was in me ordained of the Lord to eternal life, might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the power of Death and Hell, which once reigned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94455:3"/>
and ruled over it, and had the Dominion, but now life eternal is known and witneſſed over Death, which once had the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and him that was dead is alive, and liveth for evermore. And thus through Judgment and condemnation unto all that which was at enmity with God, and alſo the enemy of my ſouls peace, I paſſed through great tryals and tribulations and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for the ſpace of three or four years, at the laſt in this my paſſage from death to life, and from under Satans power to the power of God. And thus was I degenerated from the firſt birth, and I was throughly ſearched, and the firſt born in me was ſmitten and dyed, which bore the Image of the earthly; &amp; I was regenerated, &amp; born again of the immortal word, that liveth and abideth for ever, and now is born of the Image of the Heavenly, which is from above, and deſcended not; and now hath a ſure habitation, and a peaceable dwelling, and the reſting place is known, and perfect peace in the Lord in meaſure, is witneſſed, <hi>who is as a cover in a tempeſt, and as the ſhadow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</hi> Yea, through a Sea of afflictions have I travelled, and the depth of Satan have I known, and now into the promiſed Land is entred, that floweth with Milk and Honey, and the birth is born and felt, that is heir of the promiſe of an inheritance therein that never fades away.</p>
            <p>But in this long time of my travail in peril, and diſtreſs, the Lord was exceeding good unto me, and by his mighty power, and by his out-ſtretched arm was I preſerved in the midſt of many temptations and aſſaults, in the heights, and the depths of the enemy of my ſouls peace, which ſometimes would exalt me above my meaſure, and into things in the ſight; and I being an unskilful warrior, I thereby ſuſtained loſs, and my pain and anguiſh encreaſed, and became freſh again but then the place of refuge I knew, &amp; that which led into the tranſgreſſion, I freely given it up to the righteous judgements of the Lord; and to the ſtubborn and rebellious was plagues and vengeance; and then into the will of the Lord my cauſe I did commit; and as I was waiting in the pure fear of the Lord, and in the pure ſilence, and in the ſtillneſs of my ſpirit,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94455:3"/>
out of the thoughts and imaginations of my heart, and ſo not from words onely, the word from the Lord came unto me, ſaying, <hi>It is the willing and obedient, that ſhall eat the good of the Land.</hi> And now the Lord hath wholly redeemed my mind out of the earth, and earthly things, and all that with the viſible eye may be ſeen, up unto himſelf, and him I have choſen to be my portion, and to do his will is my delight. And this in the preſence of the Lord God, and in the truth I can ſay, as ever the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> could, in my meaſure. <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines, and the labour of the Olive ſhould ſail, and the Fields ſhall yeeld no meat, and the Flocks ſhall be cut off from the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

miſerable, and blind, wanting and deſolate of the enjoyment of the preſence of a pure God, which you profeſs in words, but to order your Converſations aright in this your preſent Age and Generation, you utterly deny; your fruits they are ſeen, the day hath made them manifeſt, the light is broken forth, the day is dawned, the Sun is ariſen, and light now ſhineth out of the darkneſſe, and with it you are ſeen and comprehended, all your falſity and deceit, hypocriſie and wickedneſs, and deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſſe.

            <p>And now to you Profeſſors and prophane people of all ſorts, now lay aſide all your profeſſing of God, and Chriſt in words, and honouring him with your lips, and your hearts are not ſet aright to ſeek him, and ceaſe from man whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, and return to the Lord and to his witneſs in you; for now the time is come, that a profeſſion of words will not avail, nor ſtand inſtead in this the day of the Lord, for whoſoever reſteth in a profeſſion of God in words onely, and comes not to enjoy his preſence in that which they profeſt, they will miſs of their aim, and come ſhort of their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To you this is a call and a warning from the Lord to come from amongſt the Hirelings and Deceivers, and be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them in words, wayes, and works; for the Lords controverſie is with them, and becauſe of theſe things it cannot ceaſe; and alſo with all them that take their part; and no longer partake with them in their ſins, for if you do, you muſt partake of their plagues: Therefore now return to the Lord, whileſt it is called to day, and now you have time,

prize it, leaſt night come upon you, and your time be no more, and ſlight not that which judgeth, for ſin and iniquity; neither count that which reproveth you in ſecret, when you do amiſs any thing, of no value. For if ever you be redeemed to the Lord, it muſt be through judgement unto all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto him, that ſo that which is at enmity with him, may be deſtroyed before true peace can be witneſſed.</p>
