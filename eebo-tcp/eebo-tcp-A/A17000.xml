            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IEwes ſcattered over the world, having Satan breathing in them, the more they are provoked to beleve, the more they offre them ſelues to the Serpent to be deceaued &amp; to deceaue, from that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that is in Chriſt. Since ambaſſedour Barton of Godly memorie moved a principal Rabbi at Stanpol, to write to Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for Ebrew explication of our Goſpel, the Iewes of Prage, Francfurt, Hanaw &amp; others beſtir them ſelues to ſerch our croſſing of the holy ſtory. They plead that as ours teach, Meſſias Kindred is not in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: how he cometh from Dauid. And infer, ſoundly vpon our treaſon, that ſo the Goſpel should not be from God. So they ſay, that by ours, Mathew and Luke be vnreconcileeble: who bring ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathiel, as we ſay, the one from Iechonla of Salomon, as al of trueth muſt graunt, our blindes doth: the other of Neri of Nathan Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons brother.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that men of grace should never be caught in ſuch vmpoſſibilities. So they ſay, we as they, make the Romanes the fourth Kingdome in Daniel: which was to be deſtroyed before Chriſt should come in the flesh, and, that for ending, Moyſes Law, by Daniels ſeauens: we haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Alſo they obiect that our beſt ſpent 60. yeres to prove that we haue not the New Teſtament pure: which God had kept pure if he had geven it. And that we haue 20. Opiniones for our Principal article of Deſcent to Hell. To all theſe I anſwear: and pronounce all, a the an, which after warning will trap them to Eternal deſtruction.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Tribes of Iacob, Right Worſhipfull, which were placed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Sea for Marchandiſe, had ſtones in Aharons Right-care, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancing daily their Navigation, to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Gods protection. Iſachar had the blew Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir, the sky colored, to truſt in God: when <hi>Coelum vndique, &amp; vndique pontus, as Maro</hi> ſpeaketh. Zabulon had the Iahalom, the Sardonyx, named in Ebrew of beating, as in Homer, Gallie-men beate the ſea with their ores, and ſtill yet doe in Gallies. Aſer had the ſtone called the Sea: Tharaſſis, thalaſſa in
<pb facs="tcp:6130:3"/>
Greeke, is the Sea: and happy Aſers ſtone. And theſe Tribes have ſpeciall bleſsing in Moyſes. That they ſhall ſucke the riches of the Sea: and the hid wealth of the Sand: and, be of force al their dayes. And fame of the Phoenices for navigation in Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus and Sidon, among Graecians, was for theſe Tribes; as we may gather by ſcripture. How Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ships went with Chyrams to Tarſis or Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, the Law telleth, and Ariſtotle harpeth vpon it.. Ariſtotle telleth that Phoenices went to Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſus, beyond Spaine, and for their countrey trash had ſuch ſtore of ſilver that they made their very ancores of ſilver, even to ſpare ſo much in their fraight, being full laden with ſilver, that if they kept their yron, ſo much ſilver muſt be caſtaway. <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſeemeth to have mished in the word <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſs,</hi> which meaneth the ſea: and not one ſoile: in Chanaan ſpeach. And for Cethem of Ophir, this honoreth Iſraels travelling far. I asked a ſimple mariner which had ben in the weſt Indians, what they called gold there: he ſaide Cethem, iuſt the ſcripture terme: and yf Spaniards of late for ſome conceipt did not give gold there that name, Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb facs="tcp:6130:3"/>
Fleete may well ſeeme to have gone into thoſe quarters, and marchantes of Iſraell to have shewed there that they worshipped the God of Heaven: and to have invited ſome home with them. And whereas Ariſtotle writeth of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagineans, that beyond Hercules pillers they found an happy ſoile: and Plato of a moſt large Countrey, as now we know, Phoenices and Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char with Zabul on might well give the occaſion to all this. So honorable would the Law have Merchants care, &amp; Gods care for them that know him. But without ſingular bleſsing of God, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſuffre great loſſe: it were to be wished that all of ſtately Companies should have the chiefe groundes of holy learning knowen. Iſachar is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended above all Tribes for skill in times what Iſrael should doe: as how the feaſtes of Paſcha and all appendantes by the Heavens courſe should be ruled. As of neceſsitie they were to be Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticianes that goe to the ſea: ſo this Tribe paſſed them that kept at home. And now a dayes men for ſo much match Iſachar, for Marchandiſe, but not many Nations for skill of holy Law, yet in
<pb facs="tcp:6130:4"/>
England Merchandes haue bene a great help to hold the Goſpel, mainteyning our beſt lerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, to reſtore the trueth, after our holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs calling for vengeance from vnder the altar rowled vp the Popes heaven, as a booke rowled: I will shew them S. Iohns Apocalyps wherof I giue you the ſum, by chapters, that they may ſee the marow of his booke. He telleth that Chriſt shewed the ſtate to come to the end of the world &amp; a viſion of him ſelf: as vnto Daniel, ch. 10. this doth he, ch. 1. And in ſingular ſweetnes to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſtarres in the ſeauen Golden Candelſtickes all theſe partes be applyed with addition againſt all Arianes that the Eternal, the Sonne of God, the creatour of the world, is hee that appeared vnto Daniel. So Iohn expoundeth Daniel, into ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al Iewes of Grace. This goeth through, ch. 12. In eaſy facility.</p>
               <p>Now for times to come, this appeareth ch. 4. God on a throne ſitteth a Iudge, like Iaſper, for Beniamins temple: &amp; Sardius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Ruben: to fight for the tribes. And Chriſtianes, in ſtate Perſones, are 24. Bishops, and beſides goodly, this in ch. 4. Then the Lambe &amp; Lion openeth the booke of
<pb facs="tcp:6130:4"/>
ſeauen ſeales, ch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. then he cometh further, againſt Caeſſ. on horſe, white, with plaguing riders, vpon red, black, Pale: For the martyrs, who crave to deſtroy the Empire, but are bid to expect Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianes Perſecution. Then shal their profane world be rowled vp, ch. 6. After that, a generall apoſtaſie cometh, ch. 7. How that falleth out, the ſeaventh ſeale doth shew. Chriſt ſtandeth at the golden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: to receaue all prayers, &amp; Rome bends a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt all this. Thervpon Chriſt, as in Ezekiel, caſteth fier into the earth: &amp; Angels trumpetters ſound how hayle and fyre is mixt with blood: by that, Popes be made a mountayne: ſo a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of fyre caſt into the worlds ſea: to ſet all on fyer. when the ſtar Byshop falleth from his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, to turne the law waters, into wormewood and to darken the chief ſun, mone, and ſtarres: comming vp by falling &amp; by turning the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into gal, ſone darkning the third part of the Church: that three woes are pronu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced ch. 8. By his keyes of the pit, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he fetched the woorwood of his haereſies, he bringeth Locuſtes of monkes to devour all the weſt, &amp; able to make warres, and becometh King of Locuſtes: and maketh
<pb facs="tcp:6130:5"/>
warres: and ſo becommeth a fyrie mountaine, to make hayle and fyer mixt with blood. This was one woe. He weakened the Eaſt Empire to ſet vp the Saracenes: and is plagued from Emphrates: as his Idolatrie and treacherie turned away the Eaſt, chapt. niene. Chriſt reviveth the Goſpell, when men eat the litle booke, teaching againe, How he is the Angell of Covenant, and mediatour for the faithfull, capit. 10. Martyrs bringe policies to ſee what the king of Locuſtes his citie or Policie is: and he falleth, and the Goſpell is reſtored: and he falleth with worldes end, capit. xj. The ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is repeated for Caeſars and Pope in a Dragon of Roman armes. As it was called Egypt, capit. xj. and Pharaoh, a Dragon, Eſai 27. The vpper part of the Dragon is shewed to be the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: one compiled of the foure in Daniel: and the taile is expounded to be the beaſt ariſing from the earth, capit. xj. or King of Locuſtes, capit. 9. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viveth the former Empire, ſo, that none can live in it, without his marke, capit. 13. His marke is to force Chriſtians to Idolatrie. For which vilanie Roman Babylon is told of a fall, capi. 14. By vrging
<pb facs="tcp:6130:5"/>
Idolatrie, he driueth from his Aegypt, the Church through a ſea of fyre and faggot, into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Where the tabernacle built hath a ſmoke of Gods anger, and Angels ſeauen plague him as he plagued all vnder the ſeauen trumpets, ch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. The beaſt reviued hath no difference from the former: but in bloody colour, &amp; the daughter Rome ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon it, all bloody, ch. 17. Rome shall fall as Babylon &amp; Tyrus did, ch. 18. It shall fall when all nationes ſing Haleluiah, vpon the deſtruction of the wicked, with vnderſtanding. Then the Word of God wil catch the beaſt falſe Prophet: the whole dragon reviued, &amp; caſt him into a Lake burning, with fyer &amp; Brimſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which is the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d death, ch. 19. But the Roman Dragon shal be tyed a thouſand yeres, before the King of Locuſtes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth generally. But then he makes a new Gog &amp; Magog. for the old Ieruſalem: &amp; thervpon shal be deſtroyed, as the old was, by the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, ſo he by the ſecond, of Chriſt, from a throne of Iudgement: as the old Gog &amp; Magog was, ch. 20.

For he muſt be God that can deſtroy the workes of Sathan. Moreover, <hi>Kimchi</hi> ſaieth vpon Ezek. chap. 40. That the Meſſias redeemeth in a Iubily. Now looke to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt progreſſe of times by Chalebs age, Ioſ. 14. telling how it was 45. ſince Moyſes ſent him to view the Land: So in the ſeaventh the Lande was parted: then the eight is the firſt to the Iubilee, ſo the firſt Iubily <hi>Chuſan</hi> is tamed by <hi>Othoniel,</hi> and there beginneth a bleſſing with your firſt Iubilee. in the ſeaventh Iubilee the Arke commeth into Iudah: and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim his glorie was transferred to the tribe of Meſſias.

                  <hi>Iapheth</hi> taught his ſonnes ſoules immortalitie, and that by death they ſhall goe hence to God, where place of ioy ſhall ever holde the good: and place of torment the bad. The common name to both is <hi>haides:</hi> a place vnknowen. And the Heathen of moſt auncient time, made <hi>haides</hi> to haue two partes. <hi>Leimonas,</hi> that is floriſhing places of the Godly, and <hi>Tartaron,</hi> a iayle of the wicked: So God and all ſoules are in <hi>Haides.</hi> And to the holy, <hi>Haides</hi> is Heaven. To the other HELL. <hi>Leonidas</hi> King of <hi>Spart,</hi> when with few hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreths hee fought againſt verie many thouſandes of <hi>Parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> hee encouraged his Souldiours thus: Dine with a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant courage, <hi>O Lacedaemonians:</hi> We ſhall Suppe in <hi>Haides.</hi> This he made the whetſton of valour: that he who dieth for his Countrey, ſhould have in <hi>Haides</hi> a ſure Lodge of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as <hi>Tully</hi> tranſlateth that word. Agreeable to that <hi>Plato</hi> the Eloquent would haue it taught as the foundation of a good common weale, that <hi>Haides</hi> hath place of Eternall ioy: for the iuſt and valiant, and ſuch as die for their Countrey: and place of Eternall woe for the evill and cowardes, that will rather flee away then die for their Cittie. <hi>Sophocles</hi> is moſt noble in this kinde, in verſes cited by <hi>Iustin Martyr:</hi> and by full many after him. Him I have cited vpon Iob. And that all ſoules goe to Haides from <hi>Homers</hi> dayes all kindes of Greekes holde that, and many great volumes would not conteyne all their teſtimonies.</p>

Chriſt being in aeternall ſpirit the God of <hi>Bethel,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that hath the name of <hi>Adonaj</hi> in him, Ex. 23. taught Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all divinitie: and teacheth nothing in the New Teſtam. but that which he taught in Moyſes and the Prophetes.
Now <hi>HE,</hi> in Levit. 26. where the recompence of keeping the Law is tolde, telleth of life eternall by dwelling with God: &amp; of death by Gods angri face. And that you ſhould know, that the Law was given to humble you to receive the mercies in Chriſt: You are told of 28. fold puniſhmentes, &amp; of <hi>Babels</hi> 70 yeares, &amp; that then ye will confeſſe your ſinnes, as Dan. chap. 9. did. And then God will teach his covenant, which the Angell did: That Chriſt in the time ſet, ſhall end ſacrifice and offring: that is, alter the lawes which Moyſes gave. S. <hi>Steven</hi> was accuſed for the Angells wordes: and as all the Synedrion looked vpon him, they beheld his face as the face of an Angell, Act. 7. None of you all ever durſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the ſtorie.

He ſaieth that <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> taught the L. of <hi>Edeſſen,</hi> that our Lord was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, dead, and buried, and went to <hi>Haides:</hi> and thence hee raiſed vp the juſt: which had of long time bene a ſleepe.

Your Pope is farre aboue all Emperors as ye deeme: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as your church depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vpon him, ye are openly cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Here I gave place to others, as reaſon would: &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencer gaue certen Battes to the Repliers: and the Bedell brought ſo to me: and they requeſted me not to refuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was celebrated by the very Ieſuites, over the Empire: that none could anſwer the arguments. And for all that I am to teach you, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that all mine extant in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek or Latin, they allow. And for all that, they haue more, I reiect it. Theſe be vaine dreames, that one Apoſtle could be above another: That <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome:</hi> that any ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bind, or loſe ſinnes: but by teaching what bindeth, what lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: that one man ſhould in Divinitie be above all: that the Barbarous Latin ſhould exclude the Hebrew law: where thouſands of names, as in the book of Numbers, haue plain ſentences vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But in other tongues we ſpeak them to leſſe comfort. And ſo the new Teſtam. in Greek hath every word as a Pearle, to them that can tell from what Heathen, the floure of <hi>Athens</hi> they be taken: or in what imitation of the 70. or Thalmudique, for weightie common places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

or which turne eloquent Greeke to Beryllike or Carbuncle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like termes of the Law and Prophetes. One skilfull in Greek and Ebrew ſhall in reading the New Teſtament runne in memorie through all Attique and Thalmudique The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin is to the Greeke but as a ſtutter to eloquent. And a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian curſe came to the world: when the Grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in the tongues of <hi>Heber</hi> and the Greeke, was deſpiſed: and a latepatched barbarous came in ſteede of it. The plague of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Alaricus</hi> and <hi>Genſericus,</hi> and <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> and <hi>Totilas</hi> that pilled <hi>Rome,</hi> might haue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, of preferring the Barbarous before the Holy. The next wickednes is this: That any ſhould commaunde any of the ſimpleſt not to read the Bible: or any learned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted by a companie, not to expound it. If the Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of the Bridge-makers at <hi>Thymbris</hi> had taught <hi>Rome</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day of the Lord <hi>Iohns Apocalyps,</hi> they had not bene now in diſpute for Faith and Dominion. By the groundes which they muſt graunt, and I would bring to you, no one whit of Bible will ſerve the Bridge-maker of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Sozimus</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him. The mainteyning of a Barbarous Schoole Latin, and wicked <hi>Aristotles</hi> falſe groundes giveth him colour of Prate: If Graecia ruled ſtudies, as after the Apoſtles dayes it did ſix hundreth yeares: and your Thalmudique ſtudies were ioyned; to ſhew that our Apoſtles have nothing but by your graunt it had bene plain of old. I will anon plead your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent with me: and now tell you that the myſterie of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, that God in the fleſh reconcileth the world vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: this, your Doctours ſpeake, but knew not what they ſpake. In other poinctes your olde Scribes better cleare our Apoſtles then any of our owne ſide: by reaſon that their diſputations are vpon Moyſes to their vein. hard to vs, eaſie to you.</p>

Now when Ezekiel had comforted the Iewes, that they ſhould have a returne as a reſurrection, he warneth them, that they ſhould looke for no kingdome in this world: but that the Lande of <hi>Gog,</hi> or <hi>Gyg,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> by <hi>Graecians,</hi> ſhould afflict them with Great helpes from many cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys, as you know.

Then the taile of the Dragon is a beaſt alone, comming out of the quiet earth: bearing two hornes like a Lambes: but the mouth of the former Dragon, &amp; maketh the former beaſt aliue againe: and ſuffereth none to vſe policie, but them that vſe the markes of his Policie: worſhip of Idoles, now openly tolde.

And the Eternitie of the Sonne is manifeſt, in that he is Agr;. and ω. the beginning and the end, who is, who was, and wilbe the Almightie. Now he commeth to tell the opportunitie of the Viſions.

But <hi>Patmos</hi> now telleth that the Church ſhalbe in the wildernes: as in chap. 7. it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by open ſhew, but as in Ieruſalem vnder <hi>Sedekias,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 9. when an Angel ſealeth them which belang to God: ſo of vs heathen, an Angell ſealeth them that bee his, when the open face of the Church was gone: and the Dragon, head and tayle driveth the Church into the wildernes: and the beaſt compounded of Daniels foure once dead and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, but of purple colour, and having a Rider, a Woman, in ſcarlat, drunk with the blood of the Sainctes, this drove the Church into the Wildernes through a fea of troubles, mixt with fire and fagot. <hi>Rab.

Great armies of Spirites, not reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing ſo fully as they ſhould Gods counſell, though when Man was made, they were very good, as all creatures, yet great armies of millions being left vnto their owne ſway, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mans ſuperioritie: and kept not their ſtanding, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of poyſonfull hatred againſt God: and by leave went into the ſerpent, and deceaved <hi>Eua,</hi> before ſhee was called <hi>Eve:</hi> and ſhe drew the man to ſinne: and about time of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they ate the tree fruite (Generally all tree fruites be <hi>MELA,</hi> Apples).

And then is the promeſſe that one ſhall come to be a man, according to the kinde: whoſe footeſteps and handes Satan the old ſerpent ſhall pearce: but he ſhall bruſe all his power, and deſtroy his workes. The ſerpent brought man to ſinne, Meſſias ſhall finde him iuſtice: Satan bred death: Meſsias life.

But after a thouſand yeres he ſhall deceave the Weſt to fight for Ieruſalem: to weaken all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces power: and then ſhalbe eſpied: and decay in an other thouſand. <hi>Rabbi Elias.</hi> Before ſinne came to the full in the old world, it was a thouſand yeares before Noe was named a redreſſer.

               <p>Now as Ezekiel chap. 40. ſaw a goodly Citie, ſo Iohn ſaw what a goodly Citie all the elect together good make: who though they be ſcattered, yet are in Gods care as all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and a citie comming downe from heaven: having the glorie of God: and light, as Iaſper Carbuncle Chryſtalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing: having a great Wall of Gods defence: &amp; twelve gates with the twelve Tribes names: as by their ſtorie men here come in: and the wall had twelve foundations with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles names vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them: but in matter they were the twelve ſtones of the Tribes.

                  <hi>Br.</hi> It would be a long ſpeach why Beniamins Iaſper is fift, &amp; Ioſephs Beryl is caſt off into the eight: and why Iſachars Saphir hath the ſecond, &amp; Symeons Topaz is caſt off to the nienth: and why Iudahs Carbuncle hath the place of Levi, and Levi his: and ſo for all the reſt.

The Citie was 144000. forlong. Setting eight forlongs to an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh mile. It was almoſt a thouſand miles ſquare: and what ſhould this meane? That an infinite company ſhould be of Chriſtians, though <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Saracenes</hi> endevoured general deſtruction. So the Walles were an hundred fortie foure cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites. Know you what that muſt meane? <hi>Rab.</hi> Defence is meant by Walles, as in Eſ. 54. And thence in the Septuagint Iaſpis is for Carbuncle, and ſo here. Iohn Viſions are from the old Teſtament, and not from mans fanfie.

Yea and many Kings of them ſelves ſhould gladly bring their glorie to it. And the gates ſhould never be ſhut: But night and day, in affliction and proſperitie, men ſhall gladly bring their glorie to it. And no Anathema ſhould come into it.</p>

TO Iohn furthermore was ſhewed by an Angell, a River of water of life: (as to Ezek 47. 2.) comming from the Throne of God and the Lambe. What ſhould theſe waters import? <hi>Rab.</hi> All we know that waters import doctrine: and Ezekiels fiſhers ſhall ariſe from Galilee in Meſſias dayes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6130:44"/>
to give waters of life: as we read in the <hi>Zohaz: Br.</hi> It is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veile, that yee ſhould tell what ſhould be done: and when it is done, denie it.

Laſtly, vpon the brim of this River on both ſides was a tree of life: every moneth a fruite, and the leaves did heale the Nations. That meaneth, the Sonne of God, who was reſembled in Paradiſe by the tree of life and who hetherto in both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments teacheth of him ſelfe.

And againe Chriſt telleth that he is, A and O, the beginning and ending, the firſt and the laſt.

When yee denye the Meſsias here to be God, your badnes would bring a leproſie vpon ſcripture, as <hi>Barbinel</hi> elſwhere checketh you: that as ye ſay the chief of Devills is <hi>Ben Tzirgha,</hi> the ſonne of leproſie, ſo here your

Leaſt they turne away from your eyes. Saint Paul in one ſaying doeth bring two bookes againſt you: The one, which teacheth all vnder the Sunne to be vanitie: that the kingdome of Meſſias ſhould bee for the world to come: the other, which warneth Ephraim, not to fall from God: as ye have done in the higheſt degree, to eternall ruine. One ſaying of S. Paul doeth call two bookes to teach you: two bookes bent wholy to this argument. Ye admire the ſhortnes of the Law-ſpeach: the Goſpell is all from the ſame ſpirit. Marke then if the wordes ſpoken by Angells, Dan. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. had full event to the overthrow of your ſtate, how can ye eſcape, deſpiſing ſo great a ſalvari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which began by the Lord him ſelfe: and by them which heard was confirmed vnto all poſteritie: by miracles: as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the creatour of the world.

Wiſe Emperours goe not often into daunger: as David being King, was not ſuffered. Our Gſopell telleth the true ſorrowes. Being on the earth, in our weaknes he felt bodily paſſions, of hunger, thirſt, and wept, and ſhewed often compaſſion: and ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Godhead, that whole nightes hee beſtowing praying to ſhew true humanitie: and, as Moyſes, ſo hee, fled from enemies.

Paſcha of Ox and Ram: as yearely, The Lambe was eaten of all the night following: that of the Ramme &amp; Ox might endure that yeare all Friday and to Saturday morning, as the Peace-offrings endureth two dayes.

But yours would make the day to be prevented: where we never went beyond the fourteenth of <hi>Niſan:</hi> and no Paſcha might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie day ſooner: So your Doctours would make vs beleeve that your Goſpell ſhould not ſpell from God: and I am har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily glad to ſee this matter cleared by you.

No man is properly without father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſcripture. For Noe is father, and his wife mother to all men: But here is the deſcription conſidered: &amp; the forme of ſpeech: as <hi>Ramban</hi> in praeface to Moyſes telleth: that no leſſe, the formes of ſpeech, then open ſentences are to bee weighed. And ſo wee holde, <hi>Sem Rabb, Sem the great</hi> to bee Melchiſedeck, King of <hi>Salem,</hi> King of Iuſtice and peace: and likened to God. <hi>Br.</hi> If you had ſaid, Likened to the Sonne of God in the fleſh, you had hit the naile vppon the head. <hi>Gamaliels</hi> ſcholer could convince you by the depth of Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiq. that your owne grauntes ſhould ſtill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne you.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:6130:48"/>
diſputeth with you vpon your owne grauntes. And as the Devills, Luc. 8. confeſſe Chriſt to be the holy one of God: but to no good for them ſelves: ſo ye confeſſe all that wee holde: but have not grace to ſee what ye confeſſe. Ye ſpeak wordes of ſalvation, but damned of your ſelves, ye turne to deſtruction. <hi>Rab.

That as yee, ſo we, hold <hi>Sem</hi> to be Melchiſedek. Only one <hi>Barabbas,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Smalhith</hi> and <hi>Smallheed</hi> when it was, made a ſcoffe of the matter, as <hi>Ieroboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> teachers, of <hi>Iudahs</hi> faith. Not one in all <hi>Albio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that I could ever heare of, but that <hi>Barabbas</hi> ſkoffed that. <hi>Rab.

And I have ſet <hi>Doeg</hi> vpon the teynter hookes: whyle Chriſt will regard the cauſe of Melchiſedek: that mockers here, ſhalbe neither forgiven in this world, nor in the world to come. <hi>Rab.

In Divinitie all things muſt be holden in high reverence: ſpecially the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt matters: that whoſoever would elude them with a ſcoffe, ſhould be holden the <hi>Gangraena</hi> of all mankinde.

athean ſhame. But <hi>Iſaac Ben Arama</hi> vpon Gen. 47. And <hi>Rab. Sadaias,</hi> as is ſhewed, vpon Dan. 7. confeſſe that the Pſalme ſpeaketh of Meſſias. And who but he ſhould be ſpoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to ſit vpon th righte hande of God? and that hee ſhould fill all with dead carkeſſes for reſiſting his trueth of aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace of the gift of iuſtice to reigne for ever? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeing we have ſo great an high Sacrificer which is gone into the heavens Ieſus the Sonne of God, embrace with vs the profeſſion which Chriſt him ſelfe taught. <hi>Rab. Elias.</hi> We ſay in <hi>Zohar</hi> and elſwhere, that <hi>Michael,</hi> who is called alſo <hi>Iehovah,</hi> doeth in heaven all that <hi>Aharon</hi> did repreſent on earth: &amp; ſo, will when our ſtate ſhalbe reſtored. <hi>Br.</hi> Aharon figured what <hi>Michael</hi> or <hi>Iehova</hi> the ſonne ſhould doe in the dayes of his fleſh. <hi>Br.</hi> But we were aey to looke for one that could have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion with our ſinnes. Therefore come with aſſurance vnto the Throne of Grace: that ye may finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in due time. And againſt your haereſie conſider this: Every ſacrificer muſt be taken from men, for matters touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, to offer ſacrifices and giftes: being fit to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, as he was environned with infirmitie. And ſo would God ſhew in the dayes of <hi>Noe</hi> by <hi>Sem</hi> changed in office: as one likened to the ſonne of God: &amp; in Thalmudique phraſe reſtified as ſtill living: that the Eternall ſonne who ſhould deſtroy the workes of Satan, would in the fleſh ſacrifice him ſelfe for vs: and being conſecrated bee authour of eternall ſalvation to all that would obey him. So the ſumme of our propos is, that we have ſuch a ſacrificer which is ſate on the right hande of God: miniſter of the Sanctuarie and true Tabernacle: who through the veile of his fleſh went into the holy. <hi>Rab. Elias.</hi> Doe yee all in England beleeve, that Ieſus Chriſt his ſoule went from the body to heaven? <hi>Br.</hi>

Our Greeke abridgement of faith ſaith: He was crucified, dead and buried, and went to God: where the godly have heaven, and the godles hell. <hi>Rab. Elias.</hi> Wee holde ſo all in <hi>Gether Maleuth:</hi> that on high be chambers of joy and light, &amp; chambers of torment in fyre &amp; brimſtone. <hi>Br.</hi> Seeing then it is appointed for all to die: and then commeth iudgement: while it is ſayd to day, ſeeke vnto the mercy of GOD in Chriſt: otherwiſe your portion ſhalbe in the lake burninge with fyer and brimſtone. Your Law had but a ſhadowe of things to come: not the very image of matters. For it was vnpoſſible that the blood of oxen and goates, ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſinne: Therefore Ieſus comming vnto the world ſaith: <hi>Sacrifice &amp; offring thou regardest not: Behold I come to do thy will.</hi> In the whole roule of thy booke it is written: By this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of wil we are ſaved. Therfore ſeeing we have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to enter into the Sanctuarie by the blood of Ieſus: Let vs come with a true heart and certeintie of faith into that way which he hath conſecrated for vs. Yee have felt nowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 1500. yeares eternall deſtruction for falling into the handes of the livinge God: while yee dreame hope by the workes of the Law Sabbath and Circumciſion, though yee breake all the reſt: when ye ſay: <hi>Sabbath ſhakul ce col hatorah:</hi> and <hi>Milah ſhakul co col hatora.</hi> The Sabbath is weighed as all the Law: Circumciſion is weighed as all the Law.

But holde you on your purpoſe for writing in Ebrew for our vſe. You know what encomion <hi>Rabbi Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> hath written you: and what contempt of others. <hi>Br.</hi> That will doe me little good: Seeing the worlde is full of prophane ſcoffers and dullardes.

But as <hi>Machmad</hi> barbarous, found moe fellowes in fourtie yeares: then millions of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned found: ſo one <hi>Therſites</hi> will trouble the Greek Campe more then millions ſage. But to conclude, as <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did bleſſe <hi>Iſraell:</hi> ſo I grone to teach you, how all bleſſings were aey in Chriſt: &amp; all the Law fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Say not in your heart, who can goe vp into heaven to bring Chriſt downe? or who can goe into the deepe of the earth to bring Chriſt from the dead? But beleeve that Ieſus is the Eternall God:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6130:50"/>
and that the Godhead raiſed the man from death, and you ſhalbe ſaved: and receave the power of his ſpirit to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from death to life: and by the aboundance of Grace of the gift of iuſtice reigne with Chriſt for ever and ever. That there be in the holy Eternall three heads, and are brought all to one: ye confeſſe, in <hi>Zohar,</hi> Deut. col 559. &amp; that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell Iehova, is God of <hi>Bethell:</hi> that doth <hi>Ramban</hi> vpon Exod. 23. and for pluralitie of perſons, yee doe note better then ever any other vpon, <hi>Let vs make man,</hi> Gen. 5 and vpon Pſa. 33. in <hi>Midras Tillin:</hi> and in <hi>Saned.</hi> fol. 38. and infinitelie.

                  </gap>piades</hi> more will well reach to <hi>Chilon</hi> his office, to caſt it into the ſixt <hi>Olympiade.</hi> Any one would bee aweary to reckon the diverſities which be of <hi>Olympiades</hi> in Greekes. Clement hath this: That Ezekiel prophecied in the 48. <hi>Olympiad.</hi> and ſo Aggej in the 48. And there was neare 100. yeares betwixt their prophecies. Endles be the differences: and from ſundry games of old men reckoned them, not reckoning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: but when ſuch a gameſter as <hi>Diagoras Rhodius</hi> wan the price: ſo <hi>Theucidides</hi> reckoneth them. Before <hi>Alexander Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> no auctour in copies vnblamed numbred an <hi>Olympiad. Hippias Elaeus</hi> might ſeeme to toy: But none would regard him. And in <hi>Fastis Siculis,</hi> The <hi>Olympiad</hi> of <hi>Regifugium</hi> is not 68. as in <hi>Euſebius.</hi> But in 86. or 85. as I remember. So the goodly tables of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Glareanus</hi> made from <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> when they are examined, have ſmall auctoritie.</p>
            <p>Your great learned man that wrote againſt the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha, to daſh the holy Bibles auctoritie: and to ſet vp Satans lies, ſhould not be in that argument in too high eſteeme. <hi>Galen</hi> warneth vpon <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that the greateſt part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> Librarie was peſtered with forged workes. And Hiſtoriques mooved every ſtone to feigne concent to time: But when they are traced in particulars, agreement falleth moſt vpon the Angells accompt. And without mans aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that ſhould bee holden ſimply. And the Iewes, who reckoned hourely their comming home from Babell: and had their ſeavens to helpe them, never diſagree in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell about the time: that Iohn was to Baptiſe, and Meſſias to appeare. And when I drove your Doctor to this exigent, to begin the time at the Angells meſſage, and to ſay 70. <hi>ſepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>

               <hi>completis exciſus eſt Ch.</hi> I thought I had done enough to make any ſee that I had the victorie: and I never thought he ſhould be ſuffered to ſay that the holy Angell meant no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten time. As god wil not be mocked ſo he would not mock: to ſpeake of foure hundred and nienetie yeares, when the worlde ſhould looke for ſalvation: and not performe the worke till five hundred and ſixtie yeres. God his vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able trueth cannot ſo deale with the ſonnes of <hi>Adam.</hi> If in his life time his Lectures had come foorth I had anſwered him in Latin.
