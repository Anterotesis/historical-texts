            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>FIRST;</hi> it is concluded and agreed, that for the future, there ſhall be a good, firm and laſting Peace, confederation and perpetual alliance and amity between the moſt Chriſtian and Catholick Kings, their Children borne and to be born, their Childrens Succeſſors, and Heirs; their Kingdoms, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Countries and Subjects, who ſhall love one another as good Brethren, procuring with all their power the mutual good, honor and reputation one of the other, and ſhuning <hi>bona fide,</hi> as much as in them ſhall lye, the damage one of the other.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In conſequence of that good re-union, the Ceſſation of all manner of Hoſtility, concluded and ſigned the eight day of <hi>May</hi> of this preſent year, ſhall continue according to its tenor, between the ſaid Lords and Kings, their Subjects, Vaſſals, and Adherents, both by Sea and other Waters, and by Land; and generally in all places, where the War hath been hitherto between their Majeſties. And if any new thing, or ways of Fact ſhould hereafter be attempted by the Arms, or in any manner whatſoever, under the name of the Authority of either of the ſaid Lords and Kings, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the other, the dammages ſhall be preſently repaired, and things put again in the ſame ſtate, as they were in upon the eighth day of <hi>May</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50234:3"/>
aforeſaid, when the ſaid ſuſpenſion of Arms was agreed on and ſubſcribed, the tenor whereof ought to be obſerved until the publication of the Peace.</p>
            <p n="3">III. And for hindering leſt the differences, that might hereafter happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt any Princes or Potentates in Alliance with the ſaid Lords and Kings, be able to alter the good correſpondency a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

After which, if the Authority of both the Kings or their Offices and interpoſition, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the accommodation, and the Allies do at laſt take the way of Arms, every one of the ſaid Lords and Kings ſhall be free to aſſiſt his Allie with his Forces, without incurring thereby any breach betwixt their Majeſties, or any alteration of their Amity: Each of the two Kings even promiſing in that caſe, that he will not ſuffer that his Arms, nor the Arms of his Allie ſhould enter into any of the Dominions of the other King, there to commit any hoſtility; but that the quarrel ſhall be ended within the limits of the Dominion or Dominions of the Allies, that ſhall fight together; ſo that no warlike action, or any other done in that conformity, ſhall be deemed a breach of this preſent Treaty of Peace.</p>
            <p>As likewiſe, whenſoever any Prince or State in Alliance with either of the ſaid Lords and Kings, ſhall be directly or indirectly aſſaulted by the Forces of the other King, in what he ſhall hold and be poſſeſſed of at the ſubſcribing of the preſent Treaty, or what he ought to poſſeſs in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, it ſhall be lawful to the other King, to help or aſſiſt the aſſaulted Prince or State; and yet whatſoever ſhall be done in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the preſent Article, by the Auxiliary Forces, whilſt they ſhall be in the ſervice of the aſſaulted Prince or State, ſhall not be deemed a breach of the preſent Treaty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in caſe it ſhould happen that either of the two Lords and Kings ſhould be firſt aſſaulted, in what he now is poſſeſſed of, or ought to poſſeſs by virtue of the preſent Treaty, by any other Prince or State whatſoever, or by many Princes and States in League together, the other King ſhall not joint his Forces to the ſaid aſſaulting Prince or State, though otherwiſe his Ally, nor to the ſaid League of the likewiſe aſſaulting Princes or States, as aforeſaid, nor ſhall give to the ſaid Prince and State, or to the ſaid League, any aſſiſtance of Men, Money or Victuals, nor paſſage or retreat in his Dominions, to their Perſons or Forces.</p>

            <p n="14">XIV. For the execution of the Premiſes, it hath been agreed, that it ſhall be done in the manner following, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Ships and Barks, with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes belonging to the Subjects of the Lord, the moſt Chriſtian King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into any Haven of the Lord Catholick King, where they uſed to come and trade before the preſent War, and being willing from thence, to paſs unto the Ports belonging to the ſaid Enemies, they ſhall only be bound to ſhew to the Officers of the Spaniſh Port, or of any other of the ſaid Lord and Kings Dominions, from whence they are to go, their Paſſes, containing the ſpecification of the lading of their Ships, atteſted and marked with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hand and ſeal, and acknowledged by the Officers of the Admiralty of the places from whence they came firſt, with the declaration of the plate, for which they are bound; the whole in the ordinary and accuſtomed Form. After which exhibiting of their Paſſes, in the form aforeſaid, they ſhall not be diſturbed or moleſted, detained nor retarded in their Voyages, under any pretence whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. The ſame ſhall be done, as to the French Ships and Barques that ſhall go into any Roads of the Catholick Kings Dominion, where they uſed to trade before the preſent War, and ſhall be unwilling to enter into the Harbours, or being entred there, yet will not unlide or break Bulk; who ſhall not be obliged to give any account of their Lading, but only in caſe of ſuſpicion, that they are carrying any contrebanda-Goods unto the Enemies of the ſaid Lord the Catholick King, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. And in the ſaid caſe of apparent ſuſpicion, the ſaid Subjects of the moſt Chriſtian King, ſhall be obliged to ſhow in the Ports, their Paſſes, in the form above ſpecified.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. But if they be entered into the Roads, or be met in open Sea by any of the ſaid Lord the Catholick Kings ſhips, or by private Men of War of his Subjects; the Spaniſh Ships, to avoid all kind of diſorder, ſhall not come nearer to the <hi>French,</hi> than the reach of the Canon, and ſhall have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſend their Cock-boat or Shallop abord the ſaid French Ships or Barques, and cauſe two or three of their men only to go into them, to whom ſhall the Paſſes be ſhewed by the Maſter or Patron of the French Ship, in the manner aforeſaid, according unto the Form that ſhall be inferred at the end of this Treaty: whereby it might appear, not only of their Lading, but alſo of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50234:5"/>
place of their abode and reſidence, and of the name both of the Maſter and Patron, and of the ſhip it ſelf: That by thoſe two means, it may be known whether they carry any prohibited goods: and that it may ſufficiently appear, both of the quality of the ſaid ſhip, and of its Maſter and Patron; unto which Paſſes and Sea Letters, full Faith and Credit ſhall be given. And to the end their validity might be the better known, and that they might not in any wiſe be falſified and counterfeited, there ſhall be given in, certain marks and ſubſcriptions of both the ſaid Lords and Kings.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. And in caſe there be found in the ſaid French veſſels and barques by the means aforeſaid, any Merchandizes and Commodities, before declared to be prohibited and contrebanda, the ſame ſhall be unladen, denounced and confiſcated before the Judges of the Admiralty of <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges; yet for all that, neither the Ship and Barque, nor any other of the lawful and permitted goods, Merchandizes and Commodities found therein, ſhall in any wiſe be ſeiſed on or confiſcated.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. It hath further been agreed and concluded, that whatſoever ſhall be found to have been laden by the Subjects of his moſt chriſtian Majeſty, aboard any ſhips belonging to the Enemies of the ſaid Lord and Catholick King, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not contrebanda goods, ſhal be confiſcated, together with all that ſhall be found in the ſaid ſhip, without any exception or reſervation: But, on the other ſide, whatſoever ſhall be found in the ſhips belonging to the Subjects of the moſt Chriſtian King, ſhall be free and freed, although the lading, or part thereof ſhould belong to the Enemies of the ſaid Lord the Catholick King, except the prohibited goods; in regard whereof they ſhall carry themſelves according to what hath been diſpoſed in the aforegoing Articles.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. All the Subjects of the ſaid Lord the Catholick King, ſhall mutually enjoy the ſame Rights, Liberties and Immunities in their trade and commerce, within the Ports, Roads, Seas and Dominions of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. And what hath been aboveſaid, that the Subjects of the ſaid Lord, the moſt Chriſtian King, ſhall enjoy in his Catholick Majeſties Ports, or in open Sea, ought to be underſtood, that the equality ſhall be mutual, in all manner, on both ſides, even in caſe hereafter the ſaid Lord the Catholick King, ſhould happen to be at peace, amity and neutrality with any Kings, Princes and States, that ſhould become the Enemies of the ſaid Lord the moſt Chriſtian King; each of both the parties being mutually to uſe the ſame conditions and reſtrictions expreſſed in the Articles of the preſent Treaty, concerning the Trade and Commerce.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. In caſe of either ſide there happens any contravention to the ſaid Articles, touching the Commerce, by the Officers of the Admiralty of either of the two Lords and Kings, or any other perſon whatſoever, the complaint thereof being addreſſed by the intereſſed Parties, unto their Majeſties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their Councils for the Navy, their ſaid Majeſties ſhall preſently cauſe the damage to be repaired, and all things to be executed in the manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. And in caſe, in progreſs of times, any frauds or inconveniences ſhould be diſcovered touching the ſaid Commerce and Navigation, nor ſufficiently provided againſt by the aforeſaid Articles, new ones ſhall be added thereto, of ſuch other precautions, as ſhall be thought convenient on both parts: The preſent Treaty remaining yet, in the mean while, in its force and vigor.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. All Goods and Merchandiſes arreſted in either of the Kingdoms,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50234:6"/>
upon the Subjects of the ſaid Lords and Kings, at the time of the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of War, ſhall be uprightly, and <hi>bonâ fide</hi> reſtored to the Owners; in caſe they be found <hi>in eſſe,</hi> at the day of the publication of the preſent Treaty. And all Debts contracted before the War, which upon the ſaid day of the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſent Treaty, ſhall be found not to have been actually paid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, by vertue of Judgments given upon Letters of Confiſcation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal, ſhall be <hi>bonâ fide</hi> acquitted and paid: And upon the demands and purſuits that ſhall be made about them, the ſaid Lords and Kings ſhall give order unto their Officers, to render as good and ſpeedy Juſtice unto the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiners, as unto their own Subjects, without any diſtinction of perſons.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. The actions that have been heretofore, or ſhall hereafter be intent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Officers of the ſaid Lords and Kings for Priſes, Spoils, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſals againſt ſuch as are not Subjects to the Prince, in whoſe juriſdiction the ſaid actions ſhall have been intented or begun, ſhall, without any difficulty, be returned before the Officers of the Prince, whoſe Subjects the Defendants ſhall be.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. And the better to ſecure, for the future, the Commerce and Amity between the Subjects of the ſaid Lords and Kings, for the greater advantage and commodity of their Kingdoms, it hath been concluded and agreed, That there hapning hereafter any breach between the two Crowns (which God forbid) ſix months time ſhall alwaies be given to the Subjects on both ſides, to retire and tranſport their perſons and goods, where they ſhall pleaſe: Which they ſhall be permitted to do, with all liberty, without any hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and during that time, there ſhall be no ſeiſure made of their ſaid goods, much leſs their perſons arreſted.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. The Inhabitants and Subjects of either ſide, ſhall every where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lands of the obedience of the ſaid Lords and Kings, make uſe of ſuch Advocates, Proctors, Notaries, and Sollicitors as they ſhall pleaſe; whereunto alſo, they ſhall be committed by the ordinary Judges, when need ſhall be, and when the ſaid Judges ſhall be deſired ſo to do. And it ſhall be lawful to the ſaid Subjects and Inhabitants of both ſides, to keep in the places of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, the Books of their trade and correſpondence, in ſuch a Language as they ſhall like beſt, either French, Spaniſh, Flemiſh, or any other, without falling thereby into any moleſtation or trouble.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. The ſaid Lords and Kings ſhall have power, for the commodity of their Subjects trading in one anothers Kingdoms and Dominions, to ſettle ſome Conſuls of the ſame Nation of their ſaid Subjects, who ſhall enjoy the Rights, Liberties, and immunities belonging to their exerciſe and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And that the eſtabliſhment ſhall be made in ſuch places, where with a mutual conſent it ſhall be thought neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. All Lettees of Mart and Repriſals that may have been formerly granted, for what cauſe ſoever, ſhall be ſuſpended; and none ſhall be granted hereafter by either of the ſaid Lords and Kings, to the prejudice of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the other, unleſs in caſe of a manifeſt denial of Juſtice onely; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of the Summons made about the ſame, ſuch as ſhall ſue for the ſaid Letters, ſhall be bound to bring good proofs according to the form and manner required by the Law.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. All the Subjects of both ſides, both Eccleſiaſtical and Secular, ſhall be reſtored to their Goods, Honours and Dignities, and to the enjoyment of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50234:6"/>
ſuch Benefices as they were inveſted with afore the War, either by Death or Reſignation; either by way of coadjutorſhip or otherwiſe. In which re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment into Goods, Honours and Dignities, are namely underſtood to be comprehended all the Napolitan Subjects of the ſaid Lord, the Catholick King, except only the Charges, Offices and Governments, they were poſſeſſed of. And it ſhall not be lawful for either ſide, to refuſe to place, or to hinder the taking of poſſeſſion to any of thoſe who have been inveſted with Prebends, Benefices, or Eccleſiaſtical Dignities afore that time; nor to maintain therein ſuch as have obtained any other Proviſions of the ſame, during the war; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be for the Curates canonically provided, who ſhall remain in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Parſonages. Both the one and the other ſhal likewiſe be reſtored to the enjoymeet of all and every one of their Goods, unmoveables, and Rents, either perpetual, or during life, or to be redeemed, ſeiſed on or taken from them ſince that time, either upon the occaſion of the War, or for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the contrary part; together with all their rights, actions and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions to them accruing even ſince the beginning of the War; yet ſo, that they ſhall not demand or pretend any fruits or revenues received ſince the ſeiſures made of the ſaid Goods, Immoveables, Rents and Benefices, until the day of the publication of the preſent Treaty.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. Nor likewiſe make any demand of ſuch debts, goods and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, as have been confiſcated afore the ſaid day: So that the creditors of the ſaid debts, nor the depoſitaries of ſuch goods, nor their Heirs or Aſſigns, ſhall never be admitted to proſecute or pretend the recovery of them. Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhments, in the aforeſaid form, ſhall extend to thoſe who have followed the contrary part; ſo that, by means of the preſent Treaty, they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their King and Soveraign Princes Grace, as alſo to their Goods, ſuch as ſhall be found extant upon the concluſion and ſubſcribing of the preſent Treaty.</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. And the ſaid re-eſtabliſhment of the ſaid Subjects on both ſides, ſhall be made according to the tenor of the XXVIII Article aforegoing, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Donations, Conceſſions, Declarations, Confiſcations committed, Sentences preparatory or definitive, given by contumacy in the abſence of the Parties, and without hearing of them: Which Sentences and all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be void and of none effect, and as not given or hapned, with full &amp; entire liberty to the ſaid Parties, to return into the Countries from whence they had formerly retired themſelves, to enjoy in perſon their goods, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movables, rents and revenues, or to ſettle their abode out of the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in ſuch places as they ſhall think beſt, it remaining in their choice and election; ſo that, in that reſpect, no manner of compulſion ſhall be uſed againſt them. And in caſe they rather chuſe to inhabit elſewhere, they ſhall have power to depute and appoint ſuch perſons, not ſuſpected, as they ſhall think beſt, for the Government and enjoying of their goods, rents and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, but not of ſuch Benefices as require a Reſidency, which ought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally to be adminiſtred and ſerved. Yet ſo, that the liberty of a perſonal ſo journing mentioned in this Article, ſhall not extend it ſelf to thoſe, of whom it is otherwiſe diſpoſed, by any other Article of the preſent Treaty.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. Such as ſhall have been provided on either ſide with benefices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Collation, Preſentation, or any other diſpoſition of the ſaid Lord,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50234:7"/>
and Kings, or any other, either Eccleſiaſtical or Lay perſons, or ſuch as ſhall have obtained proviſions from the Pope, of any other Benefices ſituate within the obedience of either of the ſaid Lords and Kings, by whoſe conſent and permiſſion, they ſhall have enjoyed the ſame during the War, ſhall remain in the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of the ſaid Benefices during their lives, as being well and duly provided. Yet ſo, that thereby no prejudice is intended for the future, to the right of the lawful Collators, who ſhall enjoy and uſe the ſame, as they were wonted to do afore the War.</p>
            <p n="32">XXXII. All Prelates, Abbots, Priors, and other Eccleſiaſtical perſons, that have been nominated to their Benefices, or promoted to the ſame by the ſaid Lords and Kings, before the War, ordering the ſame, and whereunto their Majeſties were in poſſeſſion to provide and nominate, afore the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns, ſhall be maintained in the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of the ſaid Benefices; and ſhall not be moleſted therein, for any cauſe or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatſoever; as alſo in the free enjoyment of all the Goods that ſhall be found to have belonged to the ſame of old, and in the right of conferring the Benefices depending of the ſame, in what place ſoever the ſaid Goods and Benefices be found ſituate. Provided yet, that the ſaid Benefices be filled with able perſons, having the requiſite Qualifications, according to the Regle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments obſerved before the War: And for the future, it ſhall not be lawfull, of either ſide, to ſend any Adminiſtrators to govern the ſaid Benefices, and enjoy the fruits thereof, which ſhall not be received but by the Titulars only, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provided unto the ſame; as alſo all places that have formerly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the juriſdiction of the ſaid Prelates, Abbots and Priors, in what part ſoever they be ſituate, ſhall likewiſe acknowledg the ſame for the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Provided their right appears to have been ſetled of old; although the ſaid places ſhould be found within the extent of the Dominions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Party, or depending of ſome Chaſtellenies or Bayliwicks belonging to the contrary party.</p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII. And to the end, this Peace and Union, Condeferation and good correſpondency, might, as it is deſired, be ſo much the more firm, laſting and undiſſolvable, both the ſaid principal Miniſters, the Cardinal Duke, and the Marquis Earl Duke, by vertue of the ſpecial Power they have had, for that end, of the two Lords and Kings, have concluded and agreed, in their names, the marriage of the moſt Chriſtian King with the Sereniſſime Infanta the Lady <hi>Maria Thereſa,</hi> eldeſt Daughter to the Catholick King, and the ſame day, bearing the date of theſe preſents, have made and ſubſribed a partcular Treaty, whereupon they refer themſelves, touching the mutual conditions of the ſaid Marriage, and the time of its celebration; which Treaty by it ſelf, and Capitulation of Mariage, are of the ſame force and vigor with the preſent Treaty of Peace, as being the chiefeſt part thereof, and the moſt worthy, as well as the greateſt and the moſt precious earneſt of the ſurety of its duration.</p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV, Becauſe the length of time, and the difficulties that would have met in caſe the ſeveral rights and pretentions of the ſaid Lords and Kings, ſhould have been put to a particular diſcuſſion, might have much retarded the concluſion of this Treaty, and put off the good that whole Chriſtendom doth expect and will receive by it; it hath been concluded and agreed, in conſideration of the Peace, touching the retention and reſtitution of the Conqueſts made during the preſent War, that all the differences of the ſaid
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50234:7"/>
Lords and Kings, ſhall be ended and compoſed, after the manner follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="35">XXXV. <hi>Inprimis,</hi> It hath been concluded and agreed, concerning the Low Countreys, that the Lord the moſt Chriſtian King ſhall remain ſeized, and ſhall effectually enjoy the Places, Towns, Countreys and Caſtles, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Lands and Lordſhips following,</p>

            <p n="36">XXXVI. Secondly, within the Province and County of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the ſaid Lord the moſt Chriſtian King ſhall remain ſeized, and ſhall effectually enjoy the places of <hi>Graveling,</hi> the Forts <hi>Philip,</hi> of the Sluce, and <hi>Hannuin Bourbourg</hi> and the Chaſtelleny thereof; and St. <hi>Venant,</hi> whether it belongs to <hi>Flanders,</hi> or to <hi>Artois,</hi> and their Dominions, Appurtenances, Dependences and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexes.</p>
            <p n="37">XXXVII.

            <p n="38">XXXVIII. Fourthly, within the Province and Dutchy of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> the ſaid Lord the moſt Chriſtian King, ſhall remain ſeized, and ſhall effectually enjoy the places of <hi>Thionville, Montmedy</hi> and <hi>Damvilliers,</hi> their Appurtenances, Dependences and Annexes, Provoſtſhips and Lordſhips: the Provoſtſhip of <hi>Ivoy, Chavancy, Chaſteau</hi> and the Provoſtſhip thereof; and the place and Poſt of <hi>Marville</hi> ſcituate upon the ſmall River called <hi>Vezin,</hi> and the Provoſtſhip of the ſaid <hi>Marville;</hi> which place and Provoſtſhip did formerly belong, partly unto the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> and partly unto the Dukes of <hi>Bar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="39">XXXIX.

            <p n="60">LX. Although his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty hath never been willing to engage himſelf, notwithſtanding the preſſing inſtances made to him heretofore, backed even with very conſiderable offers, not to make the Peace without the excluſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> becauſe his Majeſty hath foreſeen and feared leaſt ſuch an Engagement might be an unſurmountable obſtruction to the concluſion of the Peace, and might, conſequently reduce the two Kings to the neceſſity of a perpetual War; Yet his ſaid moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, wiſhing, with an extream paſſion, to ſee the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> enjoy the ſame quietneſs, which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian States ſhall get, by the preſent Treaty, hath for that end, propoſed a good number of parties and expedients, ſuch as his Majeſty thought might be ſatisfactory to his Catholick Majeſty; among which, though as aforeſaid his Majeſty was no way ingaged in that Affair, his Majeſty hath even gone ſo far therein, as to be willing to deprive himſelf of the principal fruit of the happineſs and ſucceſs his Arms have had, during the courſe of a long War, offering, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the places his Majeſty doth now reſtore by the preſent Treaty unto his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty, to reſtore yet unto him all the reſt of the Conqueſts generally made by his Arms during this War, and wholly to reſtore the Prince of <hi>Condae;</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and upon that condition that the affairs of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould be left as they are now: which his Catholick Majeſty having refuſed to accept, but only offering that in conſideration of the mighty Offices of the ſaid Lord the moſt Chriſtian King, he would give his conſent for ſetting all things in the ſaid Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the ſame ſtate they were afore the change arived there in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> in the year 1640, pardoning and giving a general Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſty for all what is paſt, and granting the re-eſtabliſhment into all Eſtates, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Dignities, to all ſuch, without diſtinction of perſons, as returning

            <p n="66">LXVI.

of the Treaty by the ſaid Duke, ſhall not be bound to execute on his part, any of the Articles of the ſaid Treaty; and yet he ſhall not be deemed, for this cauſe, to have in any thing infringed the ſame: As alſo in the ſecond caſe, that the ſaid Duke having accepted of the aforeſaid conditions ſhould hereafter happen to ſail on his part, in the execution thereof, his ſaid Majeſty hath reſerved and doth reſerve unto himſelf all the rights he had acquired upon the ſaid Dominions of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> by ſeveral Treaties made, between the late King his Father of happy memory, and the ſaid Duke, to proſecute the ſaid rights in ſuch manner as he ſhall think beſt.</p>

            <p n="79">LXXIX. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having let Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> the Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary of the moſt Chriſtian King his Soveraign Lord to underſtand, that he might acquaint his ſaid Majeſty with it, how extreamly ſorrowfull he was to have ſome years ſince followed a courſe diſpleaſing to his Majeſty; that he wiſhed he could redeem with the beſt part of his blood, all the hoſtilities he hath committed within and without the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> whereunto he proteſteth that his ſole unhappineſs, rather than any evil intention againſt his Majeſties ſervice, hath engaged him: And that if his Majeſty be pleaſed to have ſo much generoſity as to uſe towards him his Royal bounty, forgetting what is paſt, and keeping him in honor of the his good graces, he will endeavor as long as he ſhall live to acknowledge that benefit, by an invioable fidelity, and to repair what is paſt by a full obedience to all his commands: And that in the interim, to begin and ſhew by the deeds that might be preſently in his power with how great a paſſion he deſired to recover the honour of his Majeſties bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, he pretends nothing in the concluſion of that Peace, for all the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts he may have therein, but from the meer bounty, and of the own motion of the ſaid Lord the King his Soveraign Lord; and doth even deſire his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould be pleaſed fully to diſpoſe, and according to his good pleaſure, in ſuch a manner as he ſhall pleaſe, of all the indamnifyings, the Lord the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King ſhall be pleaſed to grant him, and which he hath already offered him either in eſtates or lands, or in places or money, which he ſubmits all to his Majeſties feet: And beſides that he is ready to disband all his Forces, and to put in his Majeſties power the places of <hi>Rocroy, le Chaſtelet</hi> and <hi>Linchamp,</hi> whereof the two firſt were remitted to him by his ſaid Catholick Majeſty: And that as ſoon as he may have obtained leave, he will ſend an Expreſs to the

ſaid Lord the King, his Soveraign Lord, to proteſt yet more expreſly of all the ſame intentions, and of the truth of his ſubmiſſions, and to deliver unto his Majeſty ſuch Act or Writing ſubſcribed by him, as his Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed to preſcribe for aſſurance that he renounceth to all Leagues, Treaties and Aſſociations he might have made heretofore with his Catholick Majeſty: And that for the future he will not take nor receive any eſtabliſhment, penſion, nor benefit of any Foreign King or Potentate: And finally, for all the intereſts he may have, in what thing ſoever they may conſiſt, he wholly remitteth them to the good pleaſure and diſpoſition of his Majeſty, without any pretenſion. His ſaid moſt Chriſtian Majeſty being informed of all the premiſſes by his ſaid Plenipotentiary, and being ſenſible of the ſaid Princes proceeding and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hath deſired and conſented that his intereſts ſhould be regulated in this Treaty, after the manner following, granted and agreed on between the two Lords the Kings.</p>

his Catholick Majeſty, uſing his Royal clemency, ſhall ſincerely and with a good heart receive the ſaid Prince into his grace, will pardon him, and with the ſame ſincerity will forget all what for the time paſt he hath done and undertaken againſt his ſervice, within or without the Kingdom; and will like his return into <hi>France,</hi> even where his Majeſties Court ſhall be. In conſequence whereof his ſaid Majeſty ſhall reſtore and re-eſtabliſh the ſaid Prince really and indeed into the free poſſeſſion and enjoyment of all his Eſtates, Honors, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Priviledges of firſt Prince of his blood: Yet ſo, that as to the ſaid Eſtates and Goods, of what nature ſoever, the ſaid Prince ſhall never pretend any thing, for the time paſt, for reſtitution of the fruits of the ſaid Eſtates, by whomſoever they may have been enjoyed by order of his Majeſty, nor for payment and reſtitution of his Penſions, Salaries, or any other Rents and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues he had upon Demaines, Farms, or General Receipts of the ſaid Lord the King, nor by reaſon, or under pretence of what he might pretend to be due unto him by his Majeſty, afore his going out of the Kingdom; nor for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molitions, degradations, or damages made by his Majeſties orders or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in what manner ſoever, upon the Eſtates, Towns, places fortified or not fortified, Lordſhips, Chaſtellenies, lands and houſes of the ſaid Prince.</p>

His ſaid Majeſty ſhall cauſe his Letters Patents of Amneſty to be diſpatched, in good form, for whatſoever the ſaid Prince, his Kindred, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Friends, Adherents, and Domeſticks, either Eccleſiaſtical or Secular, have or may have done or undertaken, heretofore, againſt his ſervice; ſo that neither he, nor they ſhall ever be prejudiced or ſuffer for it, at any time, nor their Heirs, Succeſſours and Aſſigns, as if thoſe things had never happened. And his ſaid Majeſty ſhall never at any time, make any inquiſition againſt the ſaid Prince, nor his, nor againſt his Servants, Friends, Adherents, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks, either Eccleſiaſtical or Secular, for any moneys he or they have taken out of the general or particular Receipts, or out of his Cuſtoms and Farms. And his Majeſty ſhall not oblige them to any reſtitution of the ſaid moneys, nor of all the Levies, of contributions, impoſitions, exactions upon the people, and acts of hoſtility committed in <hi>France,</hi> in what manner ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might be: The which ſhall be more particularly expreſſed in the ſaid Letters of Amneſty, for the entire ſecurity of the ſaid Prince and of thoſe who have followed him, that they ſhall never be proſecuted, troubled, nor moleſted for the ſame.</p>
            <p n="86">LXXXVI. After the ſaid Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> hath on his part ſatisfied unto the contents of the three Articles, 80, 81, 82. of the preſent Treaty, all Dutchies, Counties, Lands, Lordſhips, and Dominions, even thoſe of <hi>Clermont, Stenay</hi> and <hi>Dun,</hi> as he had them afore his going out of <hi>France,</hi> as alſo that of <hi>Jamets,</hi> in caſe he had it then, which formerly belonged to the ſaid Prince; together with all his other Eſtates and Goods, real or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, of what quality ſoever, in the manner aforeſaid, ſhall be reſtored unto him really and indeed, or to ſuch as the ſaid Prince, being in <hi>France,</hi> ſhall commit and appoint, to take in his name the poſſeſſion of the ſaid Goods, and to ſerve him in their Adminiſtration: As alſo ſhall be reſtored unto him, and to his ſaid Deputies, all Titles, Documents and other writings left, at the time of his going out of the Kingdom, in the houſes belonging to his ſaid Lands and Lordſhips, or elſewhere.

Whereas the ſaid Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Plenipotentiary, hath repreſented, that for the better obtaining of a good Peace, it is neceſſary that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who hath intermedled in this War, joyning his Arms to thoſe of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Ally he is, ſhould be comprehended in the preſent Treaty: His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty loving the welfare and preſervation of the ſaid Duke, as much as his own, becauſe of the propinquity of blood and alliance whereby they are related; and his Catholick Majeſty finding it reaſonable that the ſaid Duke be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that Peace: upon the inſtances and by the interpoſition of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty; It hath been concluded and agreed, that for the future there ſhall be a ceſſation of all manner of acts of hoſtility, as well by Sea and other waters, as by Land, between his Catholick Majeſty and the ſaid Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> their Children, Heirs and Succeſſors, born or to be born, their States, Dominions and Lordſhips, a reſtabliſhment of Amity, Navigation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and good correſpondency between the Subjects of his ſaid Majeſty and the ſaid Duke, without diſtinction of places or of perſons: And the ſaid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhall be reſtabliſhed, without difficulty or delay, into the free and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſſeſſion and enjoyment of all their Goods, rights, names, reaſons, penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, actions, immunities and priviledges of what nature ſoever, which they poſſeſſed in the Dominions one of the other, afore the preſent War; or that might have eſcheated to them during the ſame, and which by reaſon of it may have been ſeized on: Yet ſo that they ſhall not pretend or demand any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſtitution for the enjoying of the ſame for the time paſt, during the War.</p>
            <p n="92">LXXXXII. In conſequence of the ſaid Peace, and in conſideration of the Offices of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, the ſaid Lord the Catholick King ſhall reſtore unto the ſaid Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> really and indeed, the Town, place and Caſtle of <hi>Verceil,</hi> and all the Territories thereof, Appurtenances, Dependences and Annexes: And ſhall therein demoliſh nothing, nor damnifie the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have been made there; but ſhall reſtore it in the ſame condition, as to the Artillery, Ammunitions of War, Victuals, and any other things, as it was when the ſaid <hi>Verceil</hi> was taken by his Catholick Majeſties Arms.

            <p n="93">LXXXXIII. As for the Dower of the late <hi>Sereniſſima Infanta Catharina,</hi> about which there hath been ſome difference betwixt the Houſes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and of <hi>Modena,</hi> his Catholick Majeſty doth promiſe and engage, to ſee effectively paid unto the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Arrears that may be due to his Houſe, ſince the ſaid Dower was appointed, until the 17 of <hi>December,</hi> in the year 1620. At which time the late Duke <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> gave in Appanage the ſaid Dower, to the late Prince <hi>Philbert</hi> his Son, as it ſhall be verified by the

            <p n="94">LXXXXIV. And becauſe the Diviſions, or contrary pretenſions of the Houſes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> have ſeveral times cauſed ſome troubles in <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> becauſe of the aſſiſtances the ſaid Lords and Kings have at divers times given, each of them to his Ally; that for the future, no ſubject or pretence may be left, that might afreſh after the good intelligence and amity of their Majeſties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It hath been concluded and agreed, for the good of the Peace, that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties made at <hi>Queraſque,</hi> in the year 1632<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about the differences of the ſaid Houſes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſhall be executed according to their form and tenor.

            <p n="95">LXXXXV.

And in caſe that new conference do not produce the intended effect, afore the Spring, then both the Plenipotentiaries of the two Lords and Kings ſhall meet again together, upon this ſame Frontier of both the Kingdoms. And then their Majeſties, having been acquainted by their Miniſters of the reaſons on both ſides, and of the expedients propounded unto them ſhall make choice of that which they ſhall judge to be juſt and reaſonable, to mediate the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that buſineſs in an amicable way; ſo that the ſaid Dukes might and be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50234:19"/>
obliged to remain ſatisfied on both ſides. And their ſaid Majeſties ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur afterwards, unanimouſly to procure that their determinations may be executed, ſo that nothing might remain that may alter the publick tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="96">LXXXXVI. And becauſe, ſince the death of the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> hapned in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the laſt year 1658. his Catholick Majeſty hath been informed, by his Miniſters in <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> his Succeſſor hath ſhewed his pleaſure for the things hapned during this War, and to have a firm intention to give ſatisfaction to his ſaid Majeſty concerning his perſon and his actions, and to merit by his conduct his Royal good will, the ſaid Duke having made for that end, divers offices to the Count of <hi>Fuenſaldana,</hi> Governor and Captain-General in the State of <hi>Milan.</hi> Upon this conſideration, and of the Lord the moſt Chriſtian Kings interpoſition, his Catholick Majeſty doth from henceforth receive into his Grace, the perſon and the houſe of the ſaid Duke, who ſhall for the future live and proceed in a good and free neutrality with the two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and his Subjects ſhall have power to have and to hold a Free-commerce within the Dominions of both the Crowns: And the ſaid Duke and his Subjects ſhall enjoy ſuch Rents and Graces, as they have obtained, or hereafter may obtain of their Majeſties, as they wonted to enjoy them, without difficulty, afore the taking up of Arms.</p>
            <p n="97">LXXXXVII. Likewiſe his Catholick Majeſty hath conſented and granted never to ſend any more into the place of <hi>Correggio,</hi> the Garriſon he uſed to have there, for the time paſt: So that the poſſeſſion of the ſaid place of <hi>Correggio</hi> ſhall remain free of the ſaid Garriſon, And even for a greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and advantage of the ſaid Duke, his Catholick Majeſty doth promiſe to make moſt preſſing offices towards the Emperor, that he may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to grant unto the ſaid Duke, to his ſatisfaction, the inveſtiture of the aforeſaid Dominion of <hi>Correggio,</hi> as the Princes of the ſaid <hi>Correggio</hi> formerly had it.</p>
            <p n="98">LXXXXVIII. As to the Dower of the Sereniſſima Infanta <hi>Catharina,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned upon the Cuſtoms of <hi>Foja</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> of 48000 Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of yearly revenue, or ſuch other quantity as ſhall appear by the Books of the Royal Chamber of that Kingdom; about which Dower, there is ſome difference betwixt the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> his Catholick Majeſty acknowledging without any difficulty, that he oweth the ſame, and having intention to pay it to any of the ſaid Dukes, to whom the propriety of the ſaid Dower ſhall be adjudged by Juſtice, or by any particular conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or agreement made between them, it hath been concluded and agreed, That his ſaid Catholick Majeſty ſhall forthwith ſettle all things concerning the ſaid Dower, in the ſame ſtate they were, when the payment of the ſaid Dower began to ceaſe to be paid, upon the occaſion of the taking up of Arms; That is to ſay, if at that time, the Monies of the ſaid Dower were ſequeſtred, they ſhall continue ſo ſtill for the future until the differences betwixt the ſaid Dukes be ended, either by a definitive Judgment of Juſtice, or by a mutual agreement between them: And if at the aforeſaid time, the late Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> was in poſſeſſion of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enjoying the ſame Dower, and the Monies thereof not ſequeſtred, his Majeſty ſhall continue from this time, to pay unto the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> his Son, both the Arrears that ſhall be found to be due for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50234:19"/>
the time paſt, and what ſhall run for the future, of the revenew of the ſaid Dower, yet defalking upon the Arrears all the enjoyment of it during the time the Houſe of <hi>Modena</hi> hath been in Arms againſt the State of <hi>Milan.</hi> In that laſt caſe, ſhall, in the mean while, remain to the ſaid Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> all reaſons, actions and rights to proſecute the ſame in Juſtice, and cauſe it to be declared, to whom doth the propriety of the ſaid Dower belong. After which Judgment or particular Convention, that may intervene between the ſaid Dukes, his Catholick Majeſty ſhall pay, without difficulty, the revenew of the ſaid Dower, to ſuch of them to whom the ſame ſhall be found to belong by a definitive ſentence of Juſtice, or by an accommodation made between the ſaid Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Modena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="99">LXXXXIX. And becauſe the ſaid Lords and Kings have conſidered, that the differences of the other Princes their Friends and Adherents, have often drawn them, againſt their Wills, and the Kings their Predeceſſors, of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous memory, to the taking up of Armes: Their Majeſties deſiring, as much as in them lies, to remove, by the preſent Peace, in all places, the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of diſſention, the better to ſecure the continuation thereof, and chiefly to ſettle the tranquility of <hi>Italy</hi> ſo often troubled by the particular differences happened between the Princes, who do poſſeſs any Dominions there; The two Lords and Kings have concluded and agreed, that they will jointly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſincerely and preſſingly, their Offices and Supplications towards our Holy Father the Pope, until they may have obtained of his Holineſs that he might be pleaſed to cauſe the difference to be ended without delay, either by an agreement or by Juſtice, which the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> hath had ſo long ſince, with the Apoſtolicall Chamber, touching the Propriety and Poſſeſſion of the Valleys of <hi>Comachio:</hi> The ſaid Kings and Lords hoping of the Soveraigne Equity of his Holineſs, that he will not refuſe the juſt ſatisfaction that ſhall be due to a Prince, whoſe Anceſtors have ſo well deſerved of the holy See, and who, in a moſt conſiderable Intereſt, hath hitherto conſented to take even his own Adverſary's parties for Judges.</p>
            <p n="100">C. The two Lords and Kings, upon the like conſideration of plucking up the ſeeds of all differences, that might trouble the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> have alſo concluded that they will jointly interpoſe, ſincerely and preſſingly, their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Supplications towards our Holy Father the Pope, untill they may have obtained of his Holineſs, the grace which their Majeſties have ſo often demanded of him ſingly, in the behalf of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> that he may have power to diſcharge, at ſeveral convenient intervals of time, the debt he hath contracted to the Apoſtolical Chamber by like intervals; and that by that means, and with the engaging or alienating of part of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Caſtro</hi> and <hi>Roneiglione,</hi> he may find ſuch monies as are neceſſary unto him for the preſervation of the reſt of his Dominions. The which their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties do hope of the goodneſs of his Holineſs; no leſs by the deſire he will have to prevent all occaſions of diſcord in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> then by his diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to favor a Houſe ſo well meriting of the Holy Apoſtolical See.</p>
            <p n="101">CI. The ſaid Lords and Kings judging that they can not better acknowledg towards God, the grace they have received of his meer Soveraigne bounty, who hath inſpired them the deſire, and opened them the means of reconciling themſelves, and granting Peace unto their people, then by applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and endeavouring, with all their power, to procure and preſerve the like tranquility unto all other Chriſtian States, whoſe peace is either troubled,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50234:20"/>
or like to be ſuddenly altered; Their Majeſties ſeeing, with a great grief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the preſent diſpoſition of <hi>Germany,</hi> and of other Northern Countries, where the War is kindled, and may yet inflame the Empire, by the diviſion of the Princes and States thereof, have concluded, agreed and reſolved, to ſend without delay, their Ambaſſadors, or cauſe thoſe they have already in the Empire, jointly to act for the managing, in their name, and by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, a good and ſpeedy accommodation, both of all differences that may trouble the Peace of the Empire, and of ſuch, as ſome years ſince, have cauſed the War in the other parts of the North.</p>
            <p n="102">CII. And becauſe informations have been had, that notwithſtanding the accommodation made ſome years ſince, of the diviſions happened then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Cantons</hi> of the Leagues of <hi>Switzerland</hi> Catholicks and Proteſtants, there remains yet under the aſhes, ſome ſparks of that fire, that might if not wholly quenched, take fire again, and cauſe new troubles and diſſentions betwixt thoſe people allyed with both the Crowns; the two Lords and Kings have judged it neceſſary to apply themſelves, on this part to the prevention of that danger, as much as in them ſhall lye, afore things grow worſe: And therefore it hath been agreed and concluded between their Majeſties, that they ſhall ſend, upon that occaſion, ſome particular Miniſters every one of them to the <hi>Cantons</hi> of his Alliance (unleſs they judge thoſe they have there in ordinary to be ſufficient for the end they have propoſed unto themſelves,) with orders, when they have exactly informed themſelves of the motives and cauſes which have occaſioned the miſunderſtanding and diſunion of the ſaid Nation, to meet and endeavor, joyntly and uniformly, to procure there a good concord, and cauſe all things there to return to the Peace, quietneſs and Fraternity, wherewith the ſaid <hi>Cantons</hi> were wonted to live formerly: acquainting their Superiors with the ſatisfaction their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties will receive of it, becauſe of the affection they bear to their States, and how much that eſtabliſhment of union will be pleaſing to them, becauſe of the great deſire they have for their welfare and publick tranquility.</p>
            <p n="103">CIII. The differences hapned in the Countries of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> about the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> having ſeveral times obliged both the Kings and ſeveral other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to take up Arms; To avoid, leſt for the future, they might alter the good intelligence of their Majeſties, it hath been agreed, that within ſix months after the publication of the preſent Treaty, and after information had, on both ſides, of the intention of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> touching the obſervation of the Treaties heretofore made, it ſhall be agreed, in an amicable way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns, of all the Intereſts they have in that affair: And that for that end each of the ſaid Lords and Kings ſhall give ſufficient power to treat of it, to ſuch Ambaſſadors as he will ſend to the Court of the other after the publication of the Peace.</p>
            <p n="104">CIV. The Prince of <hi>Monaco</hi> ſhall be reſtored, without delay, into the peaceable poſſeſſion of all the Goods, Rights and Revenues belonging unto him, and which he injoyed afore the War, in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and other places of the obedience of his Catholick Majeſty: with liberty to alienate the ſame as he ſhall pleaſe, by ſale, donation, or otherwiſe: and ſhall not be troubled nor moleſted in the injoyment thereof, for having put himſelf under the protection of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> nor for any other ſubject or pretence whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="105">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:50234:20"/>CV. It hath been likewiſe agreed and concluded, that his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall pay ready money to the Lady Ducheſs of <hi>Cheureuſe</hi> the ſum of 55000 <hi>Philippuſes,</hi> each of ten Reals, amounting to 165000 Livers <hi>French</hi> money: And that for the price of the Lands and Lordſhips of <hi>Kerpin</hi> and <hi>Lommerſcin,</hi> with the Aids and Dependences of the ſaid Lands, the ſaid Ducheſs had purchaſed of his Catholick Majeſty, according to his ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Letters Patents of the ſecond of <hi>June</hi> 1646. Out of which Lands and Lordſhips, the ſaid Lady hath ſince been turned by his Catholick Majeſties Miniſters, becauſe of the preſent War? And his ſaid Majeſty hath diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of them in the behalf of the Elector of <hi>Cologne:</hi> And ſhall the ſaid Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 55000 <hi>Philippuſes,</hi> each of ten Realls, be made by his ſaid Catholick Majeſty, unto the ſaid Lady of <hi>Cheureuſe,</hi> by the two Terms, the firſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſix months from the day and date of theſe Preſents; and the reſt ſix months after; ſo that in a years time they may have received the whole ſum.</p>
            <p n="106">CVI. All Priſoners of War, of what Nation or condition ſoever, being detained on either ſide, ſhall be ſet at liberty, in paying their expences, and what they may otherwiſe owe; but without paying any ranſom, unleſs they have agreed before otherwiſe? in which caſe the Treaties made by them afore this day, ſhall be executed according to their form and ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="107">CVII. All other Priſoners and Subjects of the ſaid Lords and Kings, who by the calamity of the Wars might happen to be detained in their Majeſties Gallies, ſhall be ſpeedily delivered and ſet at liberty, without any delay, for any cauſe or occaſion whatſoever, and without demanding any thing for their Ranſom, or for their Expences. As alſo, ſhall be ſet at liberty, after the ſame manner, all <hi>French</hi> Soldiers that ſhall be found to be detained priſoners in the places held by his Catholick Majeſty upon the Coaſts of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> without demanding of them, as aforeſaid, any thing for their Ranſom or Expences.</p>
            <p n="108">CVIII. Provided all the Premiſes be duly obſerved, it hath been conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and agreed, That the Treaty made at <hi>Vervins</hi> in the Year 1568, is again confirmed and approved by the ſaid Plenipotentiaries, in all its Points, as if the ſame was here inſerted word for word, and without innovating any thing therein, nor in any of the other former Treaties, which ſhall remain in their full force in whatſoever it is not derogated unto by this preſent Treaty.</p>
            <p n="109">CIX. And as touching the things contained in the aforeſaid Treaty of 1598, and in a former made in the Year 1559. which have not been executed according to the tenor of the ſaid Treaties, the execution ſhall be made and performed, in ſuch things as are yet unperformed: And for that end Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſhall be appointed on both ſides, within two months, with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power to agree together; within the ſpace that ſhall be mutually agreed on, concerning all things to be yet executed, either touching intereſts of of the ſaid Lords and Kings, or the intereſts of the Commonalties and private perſons, their Subjects, who ſhall have any thing to demand, or complaint to make on either ſide.</p>
            <p n="110">CX. The ſaid Commiſſioners ſhall likewiſe have care, by virute of their powers, to regulate the limits, as well between the Dominions and Countries that of old have belonged to the ſaid Lords and Kings, about which there have

Lands and Lordſhips as are to remain to the ſaid Lord the Catholick King; ſo that hereafter there may ariſe no diſpute about the ſame, and that the Inhabitants and Subjects on both ſides might not be diſturbed. And in caſe they cannot agree touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the preſent Article, and of the next foregoing, Arbitrators ſhall be appointed by common conſent, who ſhall take conuſance of whatſoever ſhall remain undecided between the ſaid Commiſſioners: And the Judgments that ſhall be rendred by the ſaid Arbitrators, ſhall be executed on both ſides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay or difficulty.</p>

For the ſatisfaction and payment of what may be due on both ſides for the ranſom of the priſoners of war, and for ſuch expences as they may have made during their priſon, ſince the beginning of the war until the day of the preſent Peace, in conformity to the Treaties made for the exchanging of the ſaid priſoners, and namely that of 1646, made at <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Caſtel Rodrigo</hi> being Governor of the Low Countries, it hath been concluded and agreed, that the expences of ſuch priſoners as have been already relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or are to be releaſed without ranſom by virtue of the preſent Peace, ſhall be preſently paid, ready money on both ſides; and that as to the other priſoners that have been releaſed by virtue of the particular Treaties of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change made during the War, and afore the preſent Treaty, Commiſſioners ſhall be appointed on both ſides, within a Month of the Exchange of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of the preſent Treaty, who ſhall meet at ſuch place as ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, towards <hi>Flanders,</hi> whither alſo the Accounts concerning the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners made in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and their dependences in the State of <hi>Milan</hi> and in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in the Principality of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and in the Counties of <hi>Rouſtillon</hi> and <hi>Cerdana,</hi> and other places of <hi>Spain,</hi> beſides what concerns the Frontiers between <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> ſhall be carried; and the ſaid Accounts being ſtated by them, both for their expences for Diet, and for this ranſom, after the manner practiſed upon other Treaties of that nature, the Lord and King who ſhall be found Debtor to the other, by the ſtating of the ſaid Accounts, doth oblige himſelf to pay ready monies, <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> and without delay, unto the other of the ſaid Lords and Kings, the ſums of money whereof he ſhall remain debtor to him, for the expences and ranſoms of the ſaid priſoners at War.</p>
