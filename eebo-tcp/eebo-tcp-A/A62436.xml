         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Books that this Scribling Age is fertil
in: Thou must needs nauseate <hi>Cramben
Millies coctam,</hi> the same homely Service
a Thousand times set before thee, the same
things still repeated, perhaps false, or little
for thy satisfactory Instruction: So that it
is enough to make thee look askew, and scorn
what I have here offered to thy Perusal, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
no other from me than <hi>Cuculi
Cantum; sed siste Gradum:</hi> If you please
to make a Halt awhile, I may deliver some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
thou may'st not repent to spend time
to hear, &amp; take pains to read, tending to thy
Health; that Goddess <hi>Salus,</hi> without which
no Temporal Felicity can be enjoyed, by
means of which so long as it favours us,
nothing but may be purchased.</p>
            <p>I have ventured my own Life to save
thine, passing through a way little trodden,
full of Bryars and Thorns; and finding a
<pb facs="tcp:53574:6"/>
shorter Cut, I have given thee such Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which if thou strictly follow, may
make thy passage through this vally of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
more happy. I have declared in this
following <hi>Treatise,</hi> how we are begirt on
every side with infinite occasional Causes
that seek to ruine us; and what a Domest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Enemy we carry about us, ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
us to the violent power of preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things infesting us.</p>
            <p>I have been above this Twenty Years
sollicitous and sedulous to find out the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
proper Causes and Cures of all Diseases
malignant, but especially the <hi>Pest;</hi> for
which end I visited all sorts of People, the
Poor as well as the Rich, administring to
them Medicines of my own preparation;
observing from one, what might be useful
to another; yea, I was so eager in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of Therapeutical Truth, that I was
restless till I had the full view of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts of a Pestilential Body, whereby
my Iudgment was confirmed in some
things, and my Intellectuals instructed in
others. I have acted many Years formerly,
<pb facs="tcp:53574:6"/>
but especially now of late, when there was
most need, the part of a Physitian, Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and Apothecary, as becomes every
honest able Man lawfully called to this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Faculty. Take it for an infallible Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
(and I assert it without the least Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and Malice to any Person) that it is
impossible, without miraculous Inspiration,
for a Physitian to discharge his Duty in this
honourable Profession, unless he bring to
Unity that which of late hath been made a
Trinity, through the Laziness, Pride and
Covetousness of a Company of Dogmatists.
I speak not this to disparage or discourage
any able professed Apothecary or Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is laborious, ingenious, honest, and
furnished with competent Learning (as for
those that are otherwise qualified, I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them as so many Iack-alls or Lurchers,
that hunt up and down for a Prey for their
Masters, that they may have a share and
snip with them) with some of whom I am
acquainted, who are an Honour to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
for whom I have no small respect
and kindness; and so much, that I prefer
<pb facs="tcp:53574:7"/>
them, without Partiality, before many Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular
Prescribers, <hi>Grandia gradientes,</hi>
that carry a fair outside, make a great noise
in the World (admired of a company of
Idiots, that gaze and dote upon them, <hi>ut
pueri Junonis Avem)</hi> and yet are grosly
ignorant in <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> and the right
preparation of the same</p>
            <p>My Iudgment is, That it is no such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous
thing (as some <hi>Philo-Galenists</hi>
account it who are as it were riveted into a
fond opinion and applause of that Sect)
for a Physitian that intends to acquire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in his Science, to begin with <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macopoea</hi>
and <hi>Chyrurgia</hi> supposed, that
he have some considerable knowledge in the
Tongues.</p>
            <p>Neither should I have thought it any
Disparagement to me, if I had been (as they
falsly alledge) at first professedly instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and initiated in these Manual Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as Doctor <hi>Bugs,</hi> and some others have
been Had I (when the distressed Patient
cryed out for speedy help in the most acute
Disease) been to seek to an Apothecary or
<pb facs="tcp:53574:7"/>
Chyrurgion for the preparation and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of my Medicines; or either of them
to have made their address to a Doctor, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a sick man had in the mean time perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or at least had suffered much damage. A
true Physitian alwayes carries an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
shop about him, having <hi>in Procinctu</hi>
at hand, what is fitting to pessundate any
potent Disease suddenly sallying out upon

that whosoever is wilfully ignorant in this

than for an infirm person that truly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
Health, to pin his Life upon the Sleeve
of such a Doctor, that prescribes a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
the Ingredients whereof he knows
not, whether they be taken in right, the
proportion just; when, nor perhaps how it
was made; nay, I go farther (upon good
<pb facs="tcp:53574:8"/>
grounds) that shall not tell you the name of
those Concretes, and judge of them, laid
before his eyes jointly ordained for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine!</p>
            <p>Be wise at length ye Mortals, and suffer
not a <hi>Dogmatist</hi> to Cheat you any longer
with a formal <hi>Recipe,</hi> sent I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

with a Physitian, that he have an intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itive

separation of their pure Crasis with his own

with my self what an Army of Diseases
have laid Siege to this my frail Mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,
assailing, undermining and battering
it with great and small Shot, sent flying

Causes; I stand in Admiration, that I
have not ere this been laid flat on the

confidently affirm, That I have felt more

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53574:10"/>
Diseases that have an existence either
traduced from my Parents, or contracted
by some exorbitancy and irregularity in
my course of life. Three several times
have I been wounded by the venemous
Arrow of the direful <hi>Pest,</hi> from which I
have recovered, being despaired of by my
Friends. The first Arrow stuck deep and
long in my Groin, even four Months, for
want of application of appropriate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments
(which the <hi>Galenists</hi> alwayes
want) for indeed at that time I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
nothing could act beyond the usual

Distemper.</p>
               <p>From the Name, I pass to the Essence
and Quiddity of the Pest; which is a
Contagious Disease, for the most part
very acute, arising from a certain pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
venemous Gas, or subtile Poyson,
generated within, or entering into us
from without: At the access, or bare
apprehension of which, the Archeus is
put into a Terror, and forthwith sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to the aforesaid Poyson, invests
it with part of its own substance, delineating
therein the perfect Idea or
Image of this special kind of Sickness
distinct from any other.</p>
               <p>Touching the Material Cause, it is a
venemous Gas, or wild Spirit, produced
either inwardly from some degenerate
Matter conceived within the Body, or
outwardly received from some fracedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
noisom Exhalations contained in
the pores of the Air, taking their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
from several putrid bodies excited
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53574:13"/>
to fermentation, rarified and opened by
the Ambient, altered and moved by Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Influences, and so disposed to this
or that condition, whereby an expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is made of virulent Atoms, which
sometimes close pent up, and drawn
in by the Lungs, do by their deletery
power put to flight, confound, suffocate
and mortifie the Archeus, or vital spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
in as short a times as the strong fume
of burning Brimstone doth destroy any
small living Insect held over it.</p>
               <p>I suppose I may well compare this
mortiferous odour to the Gas or fume
of Brimstone, called by the Greeks,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Elements, difficult for humane
Capacity to render a Cause thereof. To

and Humors, to understand the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for none
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53574:14"/>
can apprehend this, but he that is <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitùs
doctus,</hi> able to soar aloft by virtue
of the nimble wings of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which
will by degrees carry him up to a high
pitch of the true Philosophical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of natural things. This material
virulent substance endued with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Leptomery, or subtilty of parts,
hath free passage through the pores of
mans Body, which are patent both for
admission and emission of minute par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
either friendly and agreeable to
Nature, or hostile and pernicious, which
the vigilant <hi>Custos,</hi> the innate spirit of
every part can easily distinguish and
judge of, detesting and abhorring the
one with a perfect Hatred, Terror, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
and Confusion; but embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and hugging the other with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
complacency, and sweet delight.
Now the Concordance and Sympathy,
the Discord and Antipathy of all things
in the Creation is plainly visible; for
<hi>Natura natura gaudet:</hi> whatsoever is
Symbolical and Congruous with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53574:14"/>
doth easily unite and shake hands
with the same; what is Antibolical and
disproportionable to it, is rejected, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,
and nauseated. Thus there is a
continual Syndrom and Concourse with
like matter to like; and <hi>Naturae Bellum
inferre,</hi> is odious both to the Macrocosm
and Microcosm. Water in an instant is
conjoined with water, not so easily with
that which is Heterogeneous: How
quickly do the many Globes of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
coincide and couple into one, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a larger Spherical body? How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
fertile do some Lands shew
themselves by an injection or superas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion
of some matter agreeable and
consentaneous to their Condition, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and inherent Property? Behold
how greedily the Air imbibes and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
up any body attenuated to a high
degree, seeming as it were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into an Identity with it! This
doubtless deceived the Ancients, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
from this Affinity and Parity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
each, an absolute essential Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53574:15"/>
of one into the other, which
cannot be, sith the primogenial, simple
and virgin Elements are stable, never
capable to undergo an Alternate vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of one into another; so that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mechanick demonstration, it
may be made good, That there is not
one grain more or less either of Air or
Water, since the very first moment of
the Creation of both. 'Tis certain the
Air is not only <hi>Separator Aquarum,</hi> but
likewise a Disparter and Segregator of
all Tangible bodies whatsoever, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the more it appropinquates
any thing, the more it breaks it into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical
parts according to its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and the disposition of that
matter it doth surround. Now the
Air being ready, according as it is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to admit Dilatation and Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and as it is thus modified, so it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates,
insinuating it self so far as there
is the least passage for it, suffurating, and
insensibly carrying off whatsoever is
capable to be volatilized; hence all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53574:15"/>
Concretes that have the least Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
do continually expire, sending out va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
emanations sutable to their grosser
matter whence they arise, which acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
an inward Ferment, or torn into
invisible parts by violent torture of the
fire, are all greedily suckt up into the
spongy Spaces, or Magnale of the Air,
which obnoxious to many Changes,
from the <hi>Blas Alterativum &amp; Motivum</hi>
of the heavenly bodies, doth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
produce different Meteors, thick
or thin, hot or cold, serene or cloudy
constitutions, and consequently healthy
or sickly Times, Diseases malignant or
well conditioned, acute or long, gentle
or fierce. Now when the ambient Air
shall be crowded full of infinite small
particles disagreeing to our Nature, in
their Figure, Crasis, Power, Texture
and Proportion, making uncessantly a
strong impulse upon the vital Aura how
is it possible but it must needs be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
altered, and at length subjugated to
the Dominion of an Exotick Tyrant,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53574:16"/>
with which it conspires to the subversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a goodly frame, the obscuration
and extinction of this bright and shining
light of life, which makes us beautiful,
effulgent and radiant, so long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
clear and vigorous, but once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured,
or put out, the Body becomes
dark, deformed, lucid and ghastly to
behold? Now the venemous antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
matter which occasions the Pest,
takes its Original immediately either
from within the Body, or without; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the circumference of the Skin, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
pestiferous Poyson is sometimes
engendred, which being incubated by
the Archeus, and fomented by several
outward Accidents, undergoing mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Alterations, is at last maturated
and specified to this <hi>Hoc aliquid Pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiale,</hi>
this kind of virulent matter that
occasions the Pest; for without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
were a man separated from all
Society, and lived in never so wholsom
Air, yet such a pestiferous seed may
spring up in the Body that may produce
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53574:16"/>
the same effect, which an extraneous
matter occurring doth frequently intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.
Neither ought this to seem
strange, sith whatsoever within us
degenerates from its native goodness,
becoming stagnant and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Commonwealth of life, is
either in some short time extruded and
banished, or rectified, reformed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
if possible, to its pristine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and if Nature cannot perform
this, then is it by little and little insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
graduated to what it is capable of,
and disposed unto; hence by the power
of different Ferments ariseth such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Poyson congruous to that semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
power it was first endued withall.
Thus the Apoplexy, Epilepsie, Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
Lethargy, Madness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take their
Original cause from such a matter that
never fails (where there is a sutable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to mould it) to explicate it self in
this or that manner, and at last to come
to this or that determinate, individual
thing it was at first destinated, so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53574:17"/>
as a Hen-egg, Turky, or Goose-egg,
if not interrupted by some acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
do constantly afford what is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
inherently to each kind. For
Diseases in mans body have as certain a
Seed, as any Mineral, Vegetal or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
and make their Beginning, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
State, Declination, Period, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and uniformly, whatsoever the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenists</hi>
say to the contrary, asserting,
That a Disease is only <hi>aliquid privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum;
non positivum;</hi> excluding it all
the Predicaments, when in truth it is
contained in all.</p>
               <p>The outward antecedent occasional
matter ariseth from some minute vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Particles, Aporrhaeas, or Effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums
of several Bodies either taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Stomack, or immediately enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in through the small pores of the
Skin; else darted into the ambient Air,
and there skipping up and down, are
ready to be admitted through the large
patulous passages of the Body, where
they play more or less a sad Tragedy,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53574:17"/>
according to the capacity of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
for it falleth out that sometimes
a Pestilential matter is taken in, and by
vertue of a robust innate Archeus, is
forthwith excluded or tamed, and
brought under the Laws of Nature; so
that what would prove great damage
and detriment to one mans health, doth
little impair another.</p>
               <p>Now the usual common broad way
through which this Poyson is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is for the most part the Mouth and
Nostrils, places obvious for the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these virulent Atoms; and needs
must it be so, forasmuch as Respiration,
which consists of Inspiration and Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
being uncessantly performed for
the preservation of life, must needs draw
in together with the Air whatever is
therein intermixt. Now there is in
some Topical Air a fermenting venom,
equivalent, and every way as active as
the Poyson of a Scorpion, Phalangium,
or Viper, which though small in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
yet operates stupendiously. This
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53574:18"/>
invisible Gas, this fracedinous <hi>Aura
Lethifera,</hi> that fluctuates here and there,
once taken into these living houses of
Clay, bears such a discord and hostility
to them, that if it be not in a short time
extruded, a certain ruine of the whole
Fabrick must needs follow; for there
is such an absolute disproportion and
disagreement between these Opacons,
dark and spiss Atoms, and the bright
luminous beams of life, that this must
necessarily be extinguished, if those
once take firm possession in us, in the
very same manner as Subterranean
Damps, and Mephitical Exhalations,
cause the clear flame of a burning Lamp
to become dim and dusky, and at length
to be annihilated.</p>
               <p>Considering that we are thus beset
on every side with such an allogeneous,
pernicions matter, that doth frequently
infest us, it is almost miraculous, that the
thread of our lives is drawn out to any
length considerable, sith every thing
hath <hi>Spinas &amp; Tribulos</hi> in it, somewhat
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53574:18"/>
disagreeable to our Nature; yea, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
things are so deletery, that they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
us like the Basilisk, smiting us
down we know not when, or how. What
strangely offensive Particles are in some
places, is well known to any that have
often changed their Region, and gone
out of one Climate into another. It
is remarkable what <hi>Iosephus Acosta</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
of the grievous effects that the
Air causes in those that ascend the hill
<hi>Pariacaca</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> what violent vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings
even to blood, defection of the
spirits, and faintings almost to death do
continually disturb them, till such time
they have passed over the Perolede, or
Valve of the Air about that hill, which
without doubt conteins in it those Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscles,
which are altogether incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
with our spirits. It is reported that
such a noxious breathing arises from a
certain Lake in <hi>Hungary,</hi> that Birds that
flie over are suddenly surprized with
death.</p>
               <p>Notable are the Stories of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trification
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53574:19"/>
of tender bodies, by certain
Corpuscles in the Air, endued with such
a saxifying power. Some Tracts of
Air offend the Eyes, some the Teeth.
Some places are Scorbutical, others
Dysenterical, these Febriculous, those
Arthritical, and here and there some are
Pestilential, which are observed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Pest Periodically (as in <hi>Gran
Cairo</hi> in <hi>Aegypt)</hi> where the beginning
and end of raging Plagues may punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
be foretold, the reason of the cause
whereof seems very abstruse, only in the
general we may probably conclude,
That there arises some eminent alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Air, and those infinite Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
it hath received into the Pores
thereof, from a Blas or Influence of the
heavenly bodies: Which, although as I
have formerly delivered, are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
innocent, free from any maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
venom, or pestiferous property: yet
they cause various alterations and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Air, whereby it is disposed to
be wholsom or unwholsom to us; for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53574:19"/>
we find experimentally, That the Pest is
most outragious, when the pores of tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
bodies are most ready to expire by
the ambient Air, which the nearer the
Sun approacheth, the hotter it is, and
thereby a Rarefaction and Subtiliation
made of those parts which otherwise lie
constringed, dormant, benummed as it
were, and mortified by extream cold; for
it is the nature of Cold to destroy the
seminal power of all Concretes as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
heat on the contrary excites the
seed of all things, and provokes them to
act.</p>
               <p>We commonly see, that a most pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
and putid substance congeled by
violent Frost, desists to send forth that
horrid ill odour, which the warmth
would quickly extract from it; que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless
had not Divine Providence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
That the middle Region of the
Air should be extraordinary cold, on
purpose to spoil various Exhalations of
their Ferments and Seeds, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
but that all things should have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53574:20"/>
been long ago reduced to their first
Chaos: So efficacious do we find cold
Seasons, through the distance of the Sun
from us, in powerfully restraining this
feral Disease, the Pest, that in this part
of the World there hath seldom any
great Mortality reigned amongst us in
a very sharp Winter. And I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that the late Contagion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it had taken deep root in mans
body, and endeavoured to pullulate, and
shoot out fresh; yet was it so curbed
and tamed by the Autumnal Frost, that
it could never rise up to any height, or
get head, its fermenting power being
still kept under by the surrounding cold
Air; which is changed according to the
remotion, appropinquation, intercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and obscuration of the solar Beams;
which though innocuous; lovely and
glorious of themselves, yet shining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a stinking Dunghil or Kennel, and
opening the body of any putrilaginous
substance, do accidentally cause a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
in its parts, and thereby an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53574:20"/>
Expiration of unsavoury and noysom
Atoms prejudicial to mans life. Hereby
not only inanimate things induce a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
to our health, through a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of their copious Exhalations
continually altering, and making im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon our spirits, weakning their
Tone, debilitating their Vigour, dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating,
confounding, and destroying
them by their deletery property; but
likewise the Respiration, Emanations
or Effluviums of divers sorts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
do often prove hurtful to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
especially one mans body doth
easily affect and infect another, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a symbolical Affinity that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
one mumial ferment and another;
for there is an easie transmigration of
virulent Particles from body to body,
where there is a magnetism, &amp; a capable
reception thereof; and under the guise of
a friendly Guest, a mortal Enemy is
sometimes entertained: And doubtless
there are some Men and Women seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
healthful, whose <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53574:21"/>
Aporrhaea's, or Effluviums, are
very pernicious to others, causing great
inconvenience and disturbance in the
Archeus, yet perhaps not sensibly to be
discovered: Sith then we are thus beset
on every side with an invisible fracedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Gas, how is it possible that mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
should be wanting for the framing
the Pest, and other innumerable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases!</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
occasional matter: That which is
next to be enquired, is <hi>Materia conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta,</hi>
or <hi>Conttnens</hi> of the Pest, which
is part of the Archeus contaminated by
the Pestilential Miasm, which primarily
seats it self in the privy Chamber of
the vital spirit, which becomes one, and
joins with the Occasional, Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
matter, to dissolve the goodly
structure of this Microcosm; for the
antecedent matter could do us no harm,
were not the Continent united to it, so
as to become capable to receive the
true figure, character or impression of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53574:21"/>
this determinate disease, the Pest; where
it remains, till such time the foresaid
matter be profligated or proscribed by
the strength of the residue of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,
as yet untouched and free from
Contagion, or the Image of the Pest
expunged, and thereby a Manumission
and Redemption of the captivated spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
from that slavery it was before kept
under by a domineering Idea. Neither
ought it to seem strange, that I reckon
part of the Archeus for the conjunct
matter of the Pest, contrary to the
Doctrine of the Schools, who never
dreamed of any such thing, till that
great Deliverer of Philosophical veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>Helmont</hi> brought it to light; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as nothing exotick or venemous
could do us any hurt, did not the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,
the vital spirit cowardly first yield
it self Prisoner to the assailing Poyson;
and then afterward become confederate
to act with it, to the demolition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation
of that Fabrick which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
might stand unmoved.</p>

and actuated by some spirit, which
contrives, moulds and fashions it into
such a form, that doth specifie and make
it distinct from another by its essential
Properties, and inseparable Accidents.
This spirit, Archeus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of all
Things is chiefly seated in the Seed;
for without a seminal power nothing
can have production. Every thing that
acts is furnished with some portion of
the universal Spirit; and even those
things that seem to be vapid, dull and
torpid to our senses have in them lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
a spirit dormant, which gave them,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53574:22"/>
and maintains their being. Now there
are many different kind of Seeds, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Spirits (all derived from the
Universal) as there are things in the
World which act according to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Matter, and capacity of
the Subject: For <hi>unumquodque recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
secundum captum recipientis;</hi> and
<hi>Ex quovis non fit quodlibet:</hi> Which is
to be understood of a secondary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
matter, not primary simple Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary;
sith according to <hi>Helmont,</hi>
and the best Philosophers, all things
take their Original from Water, which
transmuted to this or that, according as
topical Ferments, and innate Seeds lead
it. However all compound bodies, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and imperfect, are confined, and
stinted only to bring forth their like, and
to act within the sphere of their activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without interfering, grating, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching
and intrenching upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Commonwealth; and within
these bounds of their Monarchy do they
still continue, till they have acted the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53574:23"/>
last Scene, and taken their Exit, and are
so resolved again into their first aqueous
Element, from which daily arise new
Actors in several Dresses. To this do
many Philosophers subscribe as Truth,
as it relates to Minerals, Vegetals and
Animals, that have a manifest principle
of generation; but they will not allow
Diseases to be taken into this Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
sith they arise from a depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and distortion of Nature, through
the fall of the first Prevaricator, who
by his lapse put the creature in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself and all Mankind: So that
a disease with them, is only a privation
or mutilation of our health, a defection
from Sanity, proceeding from divers
Accidents that daily affect us preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally.
For they think they have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
enough, in telling us, that some
good is exclusively taken from us, but
are silent concerning that positive, real
evil that infests us, having an absolute
Entity in it, consisting of a seminal
power, a fermental transmutation, an
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53574:23"/>
operative Spirit, and a lively Idea. All
which Endowments make a Disease to
be <hi>Ens reale verum,</hi> something in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</p>
               <p>That Maladies have in them a Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
power, is evidently known by
some hereditary Diseases that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
and traduced from the Father
to the Son, and from the Grandfather
to the Grandchild, which lie a long time
unseen, unfelt, closely couched in the
blood, and at length break forth into
Act upon some irritating occasion. How
is it possible that the Small Pox should
lie above Twenty years in our bodies,
before it shoot out, if it were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in a Seed, which according to the
disposition of each Individual, when
the fulness of time comes, breaks forth
sooner or later, into Buds and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</p>
               <p>The Gowt and Stone are sometimes
so concorporated with our seminal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that it may be thought as difficult
to separate light from fire, as to part two
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53574:24"/>
such Companions fundamentally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
in our Conception. Moreover,
as it is the Nature of every Seed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vegetal or Animal, in the very
moment of breaking forth into Act to
ferment, that thereby its vertues may be
diffused readily into all parts, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
an equal distribution of Spirits
made: In like manner morbos seeds have
their fermentation, which though invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
at first, yet at length are plainly
apparent by effects. So requisite is
fermentation for the production of all
things, that without it the Spirit remains
drowned and overwhelmed in untract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and indisposed matter. Did not
the poyson of the Pest, most contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
for quantity, ferment and season
the whole mass of blood, by altering
the position and texture thereof, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating
and changing it into a tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
substance, it could never cause such
a tragical Catastrophe in mans body,
quite subverting its well composed
frame. For it is grand Ignorance to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53574:24"/>
think that bare Qualities, which are
transient and momentany, depending
upon the influence of substantial Forms,
which cause a Flux and Reflux of the
heat, cold, moisture, and siccity, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Motion, Collision, Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Degradation, Indigence and Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Spirits in the body, should on
a sudden cause such a stupendious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphôsis
in this little admirable
World; wherefore nothing but that
which causes a Zumôsis, an Efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,
and leavens the whole lump of
blood by its deletery, diffusive proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
can turn all topsie turvy in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and bring a speedy ruine to this
magnificent Structure.</p>
               <p>Neither is there wanting in Diseases
an Architectonical Spirit, which is the
Faber and Vulcan that hammers out
and forges every kind of malady, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
an exact Copy, Rule and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
which was at first imprinted in it
by a vigorous Imagination: As this
Stamp, Figure, Idea or Character doth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53574:25"/>
direct the Archeus, so it begins, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
and at last concludes, according
as the impression lasteth. This pure,
restless Spirit, that at first moved upon
the waters, is ordained by the great
Creator of all things to be an exact
Fabricator of whatsoever hath a being,
which alwayes at first pourtrayes and
delineates the scheam and fashion of
whatsoever is afterwards to be done by
it. And although it was never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that Fountain of this universal
Spirit, that any thing hurtful or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to man should be produced,
yet ever since there was brought an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxy,
irregularity and inconformity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the spirit of man through the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
and rebellion of the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plastes
it hath minted and coined exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant,
monstrous, exotick Images, by
direction of which it acts to its own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
and ruine, consuming, spoiling,
making havock of that (through foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
vain Terrours, Inquietudes, Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
and Fury) which ought to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53574:25"/>
preserved and cherished by regular and
peaceable operations. Now no sooner
is it touched by any thing that is disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
and disproportionable to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
constitution, but it is affrighted,
perplexed, fretted, raged and disturbed,
and put quite besides it self, if it cannot
presently be rid of it; yea, the very
thoughts of an approaching mischief,
doth sometimes cause the Archeus
from a groundless fright to bring that
really to an existence, which otherwise
would never have been; as is apparent,
when a timerous person hearing a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Pest, and the terrible symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
accompanying it, doth through
the power of strong imagination, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
somewhat of nothing, sowe a
pestilential Seed in the blood, which
fermenting and swelling up, doth forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
entertain the vital spirit that makes
in it self a perfect Idea of that Disease
which never ceases, as long as it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
to diminish, and at length to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
the bright shining Lamp of life.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53574:26"/>
Did not the vital Spirit at first running
away, afterward entertain treacherously,
as it were, into its privy Chamber, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hands, and hugging in its bosom
that which is virulent, poysonous and
deletery, and thereby appropriate the
same to it self, entering into a firm
league with that which is <hi>Tristissima
mortis Imago,</hi> the lurid and dismal
Picture of lethiferous dissolution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
and co-operating with an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable
Enemy to mans health; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the venom of any Mineral, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
or Animal, nor the Heteroclite
poyson of the Pest could injure us, or
any way damnifie us. But as the Case
stands, <hi>Perditio nostra à nobis;</hi> and that
which was in the beginning ordained for
a sole preservative to us, doth often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our bane and destruction. And
<hi>Spiritus ille vitalis qui Actiones sanas
etiam morbosas edit:</hi> That Archeus
which is the instrument of Sanity, is
likewise the Author of Maladies; and
that saying is too true to our sad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53574:26"/>
                  <hi>Nemo laeditur nisi à se ipsa.</hi> We

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Self destroyers,
and do exactly patrize, daily putting in
practice what the First of Men taught
us. 'Tis not the outside that simply
defiles us, but all our Misery flows from
within; 'tis this domestick Enemy that
doth infest us, our familiar Friend, with
whom we continually converse, that
lies in our own bosom, that betrayes us,
and delivers us up for a spoil, to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient
Air, Diet, and other necessary
things we are forced to make use of for
a subsistence to support this brittle and
friable clod of earth.</p>
               <p>These poysonous Atoms that lurk in
the pores of the Air, and are wasted up
and down with every blast, slighly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into our bodies unfelt, unseen,
cannot of themselves make the Pest,
unless our Archeus become an efficient
and formal cause of its Quiddity; so
that it hath its immediate being from
our vital Spirit, which comes to pass in
this manner. So soon as these loathsom
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53574:27"/>
Particles enter in, either through the
larger or smaller passages of the skin,
the <hi>Custos</hi> or Centinel of that part
where it first makes an impulse, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that its Territories is invaded by a
cruel potent Adversary, a destroyer of
Nature, being surprized with horror
and confusion, forthwith flies, giving ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to its Foe to take possession of
that part, and giving all over for lost:
It suffers the fermenting poyson to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the natural well disposed mumial fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in our bodies, and to change it into
the same condition with it self; upon
this the Archeus, the forenamed <hi>Custos,</hi>
that keeps guard, &amp; always watches and
wards Night and Day for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole, being full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
and Terror, throws away the
Reins of orderly Government, and
yields it self up captive to the imperious
Placits of a Truculent Tyrant, uniting
it self intimately with full consent to
demolish this beautiful Edifice; and to
that end doth immediately frame a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53574:27"/>
Idea, and an absolute draught of
what it intends to accomplish. Then
is the first beginning of the Pest, and is
as it were <hi>in Ovo,</hi> acquiring maturity by
degrees, sometimes quickly, sometimes
slowly, according to the strength or
weakness of imagination, vigorous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or feebleness of mumial ferments,
the subtlety, or dulness of the Poyson,
the activity or drowsiness of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus.
So long as the pestiferous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional
Cause, whither it arise from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
or without, continues not actuated,
and as it were not animated by our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,
it can do us no harm; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
like an unpolished mishapen piece
of Timber, which was never yet brought
into a form by a dextrous Mechanick.
So soon as the Architectonical spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into this deletery matter, it informs
the same, and brings that into an actual
being, of which otherwise it would
have been deprived; once quickned, it
never leaves to play a sad Tragedy (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the venemous matter be suddenly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53574:28"/>
excluded, the Idea obliterated, and the
Archeus highly fortified) upon the
Theatre of this Microcosm, with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety

Pest doth principally reside, and

Mans body.</head>
               <p>I Have not been a little anxious (but
not presumptuous, as the <hi>Galenists</hi>
have falsely aspersed me) to find out
the chief Palace, or Chair of State,
where this mortiferous Tyrant the Pest
doth principally sit enthroned; where
by its beck and insolent frowns, it
makes this little World, and all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
in it, to crowch, creep, and
tremble!</p>
               <p>That this Poyson doth enter in, and
ride in the Triumphant Chariot of the
vital Spirit, both innate and influent, is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53574:29"/>
an undoubted Truth: For, as I said, by
means of it, the Pest moves, and hath
a being; and without the same, it is as
nothing; for the pestilential matter
whether generated within, or hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
from without, through the Hand,
the Foot, the Eye, the Nostril, Mouth,
or any other place; still the <hi>Custos,</hi> the
vital Spirit of that part gives it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
by cowardly running from the
poyson, and so betraying that trust that
was reposed in it, by yielding up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously
it self, and a strong hold to the
fury of a potent Enemy, to which the
Archeus becomes a Vassal to perpetrate
those things that tend to Ruine and
Desolation.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this particular da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and nocument (that arises from
a dedition and timorous submission of
the Archeus to this pestiferous Gas, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an incursion and invasion upon the
Borders and Confines of this flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kingdom, Mans living Body)
were far more tolerable, were not this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53574:29"/>
venom conducted to the very Center
and Metropolis thereof, the Stomack,
where the Soul it self keeps Court,
which incircled with all necessary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
sends forth wholsom Edicts for the
preservation of the body Natural. In
the Bed-chamber of this Noble Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,
the Stomack, doth this usurping
Disease take its lodging, darting Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk-like,
his virulent beams into all parts
circumjacent in a Heteroclite, and Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molous
manner, sometimes causing a
stupor, and lethargical drowsiness, like
<hi>Opium,</hi> sometimes a phtenzy or fury like
Hemlock, or <hi>Nuces insanae;</hi> at one time
a Numness, or Paralytical disposition,
like the Fish <hi>Torpedo.</hi> At another time
an inquietude or incessant motion, like
the poyson of a Tarantula. Now an
insatiable thirst, and a scorching flaming
heat, like one bit by the Serpent <hi>Dypsas;</hi>
then again a Coldness, Rigour and Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
like the venom of a Scorpion!
provoking in one man a hungry appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
a little before death, in another an
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53574:30"/>
aversation and loathing of all Food;
producing a manifest Feaver in this man,
and in that none at all, or hardly any
sensible; striking down one, as if he
were Syderated, or Apoplectical, and
tenderly handling another, as it were, in
a dallying, flattering and sporting way,
curiously spinning out the thread of his
life for some dayes, yea, weeks, and
then at length cutting it off! Thus this
raging venom being once ushered by the
desponding Archeus, into the innermost
Recesses and Closet of life, is by this
means become Master of the whole,
<hi>vacua dominatur in Aula;</hi> and having
quite confounded the Eutaxy and good
Government that was before in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ingenite spirit of the stomack, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
and sedulously working, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
causes the same to be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
exorbitant, hair-brain'd, foolish
and furious, careless what becomes of it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self,
and what belongs to its tuition.
For the Confirmation of what I have
delivered, That the Region of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondries,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53574:30"/>
especially the Stomack, is
the principal place where the Pest ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
up its abode. We are to take
special notice what strange alteration is
made in the Region Epigastrick by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
passions, and how the Oeconomy
of the whole body thereby is put into
a disorder (perhaps upon an imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sometimes of that which is not at all
real) as it happens when a panick fear,
extraordinary anger, an excessive joy,
some sad and dreadful News brought to
us doth in a trice distract us, making the
first impulse upon the stomack; and us
<hi>Helmont</hi> excellently observes, spoiling
an eager appetite to our food in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
quite taking off the edge of the
stomack, which before was sharp set:
And although the <hi>Galenists</hi> are plensed
erroneously to separate the irascible and
concupiscible Appetite, so that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
them into two distinct stalls, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the one, <hi>i. e.</hi> the irascible in the
heart, and the other, the concupisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in the stomack, the lower adjacent
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53574:31"/>
parts; yet if they weigh the truth of
things seriously, they may be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that the Orgiastick, as well as
the Epithymetick are chiefly lodged in
the mouth of the Ventricle, which the
Ancients for that excellency they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of it, adorned with the name of
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being of that power and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
that according to its benigne
or maligne Aspect, it causes a serenity or
obscurity in this little Horizon. Here
is the Bench, where the sensitive Soul
sits as Judge, which if rightly tuned,
and well composed, censures, and strait
puts to an end the manifold Conflicts,
Tumults, Broils, and Uproars in the
Body Natural; but if out of order, and
have an Atony, it embroils all in Wars,
being the Ring-leader, Promoter, and
efficient cause of all Disorder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
Now as from this Fountain
the Stomack, and its Co-partner,
the Spleen (which make according to
<hi>Helmont,</hi> a Duumvirate) springs our
Health, the greatest felicity in this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53574:31"/>
world; so from the same root arises
sickness and infirmity, the bitter ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
that marrs all that delicious mess
which either Nature hath provided, or
mans ingenious Cookery can invent. <hi>In
hac Olla continentur mors &amp; vita:</hi> This
is that Pandora's Box, which <hi>Adam,</hi> to
please his brutish appetite, ventured to
open for the reception of the forbidden
fruit, which was no sooner ingested, but
out flew infinite calamitous Maladies
that vexed him, and torture us his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
to this day. In this little mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
Field was first sown the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
seed of all Diseases, which ever
since never ceased to propagate and
multiply it self over the universal face
of the globe of Mankind in a direful
manner. Here is the Plantation and
Nursery of all sort of Feavers; for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did I know any afflicted in this
kind, but still the digestive ferment of
the stomack became impaired, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
from its Native goodness;
hence come those multiplicity of sad
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53574:32"/>
Symptoms which appear, as Nauseous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Anorexy, extream Thirst, bad
Sapour, Sopour, tedious Watchings,
Dotage, Melancholy, Madness and
the like. Here is the Mine where the
Stone and Gowt have their <hi>Ens pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum;</hi>
are first embrionated, and lie in
their rude Principles. In this Duumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
is the Nest where the Asthma,
Sqinsie, Pleurisie, Vertigo, Epilepsie,
Apoplexy, Lethargy, Phrensie, Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea,
Lienteria, Dysuria, Strangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
Ischuria, Scorbute, and this terrible
blow, <hi>Plaga excellens,</hi> the Pest are
first brooded, hatched, fed, and at
length perfected, and able to subsist of
themselves. In this admirable Cavity
is erected the Mint royal, where the
lively Image of Sanity and Infirmity
are stamped, and the lineaments of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Languor drawn out as it were with a
Pencil, that it may act uniformly in one
continued series and tenour, according
to its kind and various constitution it
meets with. For even a vulgar Head
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53574:32"/>
knows how to distinguish a Quartan A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
from a Quotidian, and both from a
Tertian; a continual, from an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Feaver; the Spasm or Cramp,
from a Palsie; the Dropsie, from an
Atrophie, or a macilent Consumption;
and several other Diseases one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
And this is deduced from the
Parts affected, the certain Symptoms,
Accidents and Products that inseparably
accompany each of them. The silly
old Women called Searchers, can report
upon the bare Aspect of a pestilential
Corps, when thy see Tumors of the
Emunctories, Cauterizing Carbuncles,
Blains, Pustles, and those <hi>stigmata nigra,</hi>
they call the Tokens, in the superficies
of the Skin, that this or that Person dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Sickness, Wherein although
they are sometimes mistaken by reason
of some intervening outward Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
which may hinder the eruption
of these pestilential Blossoms; yet an
expert Physitian, that hath a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive
knowledge into these things
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53574:33"/>
than the common People, will hardly
ever be mistaken in the Diagnôsis of
the Disease: And certainly this could
never be discovered aright, were not the
Idea and Platform of every grief, as it
were shadowed out, limmed and sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the ingenite Archeus of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
tractable Stomack and Spleen. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought it to seem strange, that the
Ventricle being a Membrane, should
have such admirable properties, and rare
effects bestowed upon it by power of
the sensitive Soul, there taking its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
habitation; sith the womb of the
same Texture doth sometimes act stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiously,
even to the seeming imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a new Creation out of nothing,
as when the Idea of a Cherry, Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or the like, is impressed by the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
Imagination upon that part of the
Infant, according as the hand of the
Mother shall be directed at that time of
her earnest longing; which fictitious
fruit shall afterward flourish sooner or
later, as the Native Soil and Climate of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53574:33"/>
that place doth bring real fruit to a
speedy or late maturity. Now foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the Stomack and its Compeer
the Spleen, the Duumvirate of this
Commonwealth, have such power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them, that they are as the Key
to open the Door to Health and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and as it were, the Helm that
turns and winds this Vessel at pleasure:
In what ought a true Physitian to be
more sollicitous, than in preserving
them in Eutonie, Eucrasie, Eumetrie,
and to have special care of this excellent
Organ, lest any thing assumed may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
the ferment of these parts, disturb,
disquiet and annoy the Archeus thereof?
Away then with the seculent and dirty
Medicaments of the <hi>Galenists,</hi> which I
can demonstrate to their faces, if they
dare to stand a Tryal, are not fitting to
be received into such a Noble part for
the Cure of any deep rooted Disease
whatsoever. And were not their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
grosly ignorant in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
their own life, did they but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53574:34"/>
the notable damage both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and future that attends those that
enter into this Wire-drawing <hi>Galenical</hi>
course of Physick, they would utterly
abominate such dreggy stuffe, if more
pure and defecate Chymical Remedies
could be obtained. Never let any Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of Learning harbour a thought, that
such an Elephant like, Gigantical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
the Pest, is like to be detruncated
and overcome by a <hi>Galenist,</hi> who (I'le
make it appear, <hi>ipso facto)</hi> knows not
how to remove a trivial ordinary Feaver
radically and fundamentally! And all
this proceeds for want of a clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the right use of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack;
the powerful influence it hath
upon all parts; the Nature of its Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the tender respect that is to
be given to the Archeus, the diligent
<hi>Custos,</hi> and watchful Janitor of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Pylorus. Suffer not then any
that pretends to Cure thee, to exhaust
the innocent blood profusely, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a vein in the Arm for the Cure of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53574:34"/>
that Malady, whose cause doth only
Centrally depend upon an Exorbitancy,
Discord, Dearticulation, and Apostasie
of the vital Spirit in the Duumvirate,
from the genuine well-disposed Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
that ought to be in it.</p>

               <p>JUdiciously to dicsern the Pest from
other Diseases, is sometimes a Task
of no small difficulty, in that it hath no
certain, peculiar, proper, Pathognomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
inseparable Sign emergent with it,
not common to others: So that an able
Physitian may sometimes be puzled at
first Access positively and absolutely to
determine, whether the Patient be smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by this superlative stroke, or afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with some other inferiour sickness.
He alone that is Omniscious, can infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
tell in what instant time this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilential
poyson is conceived, or enters
into mans body; so closely doth it lie
for the most part, that none but he that
knows things <hi>à priori,</hi> can punctually
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53574:35"/>
discover that such an one carries about
him a mortal Arrow shot into his <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To see a man eat and drink liberally,
to be jocund, frolick, seemingly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Jubilee, to exercise Venery, and
several Disports, as at other times, and
yet to carry about him the very Picture
of Death within, is a Plague of the
Plague. To be undermined by a Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine
Enemy little dream't of, digging
like a company of Pioners into the very
bowels of this Microcosm, and on a
sudden tearing in pieces unawares this
strong fortress of life, is that which
heightens the malice of this truculent
Calamity. For had an able Physitian
opportunity granted him to encounter
with this horrid Monster upon its first
approach, I make no doubt but that by
means of the Artillery of powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
it might quickly be overcome,
dispossessed and mortified. Wherefore
the Case standing thus with us, it is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Providence to stand upon our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53574:36"/>
guard, and discreetly suspecting the
worst, to fortifie our selves as well as
possibly may be, <hi>vim vi repellere,</hi> and
to get such a Panoplie of Arcanas, that
we may not easily be vulnerable, or at
least may speedily heal those wounds
that are made by its intoxicated arrows:
Sith we are ignorant <hi>a priori,</hi> when we
are first assaulted with this fermenting
poyson, let us strictly observe what may
be useful to us <hi>à posteriori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ought we not to despair; for
some antecedent Signs may coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
lead us to a fore knowledge and
prevision of this venemous Arrow that
is let flown at us, that thereby we may
make the better provision, defending
our selves, <hi>pro re nara,</hi> and thereby take
off by Art the virulency that attends it;
for <hi>praevisa spicuia levius feriunt.</hi> How
significant the Stars are to forewarn us
of this grievous wound to be inflicted
upon Mankind, is best known to Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,
whose Predictions I have always
found very uncertain and amphilogical,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53574:36"/>
for want of that Syderal knowledge
which <hi>Adam</hi> once enjoyed. Indeed I
am bound to believe that the heavenly
bodies were ordained <hi>in Signa, Tempora,
Dies &amp; Annos;</hi> and the reason why we do
not foretell what they often preindicate,
is to be attributed to the dimness and
imbecility of our understanding, which
since our lapse is become uncapable of
such Celestial mysteries. It is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
some general obscure Notions we
may collect from above, yet we for the
most part square them, as that crooked
Line of our own Interest guides us;
not according to the strait Rule of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
for every one is willing to put from
himself the evil day, and shift it upon
another. That Comets, or Blazing
Stars do portend some evil to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Mortals, is confirmed by long obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and sad experience, as likewise
Phaenomena of a Parelios, Parasolene,
apparitions of <hi>Draconos volantes &amp; Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,
Scintillae,</hi> now Stars, Battles fought,
and Coffins carried through the Air,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53574:37"/>
Howlings, Screechings, and Groans
heard about Church-yards; also rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of blood, unwonted matter, &amp;c.
All of which having something <hi>extra
naturam,</hi> are portentous and prodigious,
ordained by that good Philanthropos to
advertise us to a timely resipiscence, and
prevention of those evils that hang o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our heads.</p>
               <p>Moreover, when unseasonable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as extream drought, or superfluity
of moisture infest us, when waters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
a fracedinous Odour and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
when multitude of Insects,
as Toads, Froggs, Flies, Cimires, and
divers poysonous Creatures appear;
when Cattle perish in great Numbers
by some Contagious lues; when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Diseases, as Small Pox, Spotted
Feavers; Scurvy, or the like, are frequent
among us, which gave me occasion
(perceiving how grassant the Scorbute
was in this Nation) to deliver a Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that in some short time it would
break forth into some terrible Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53574:37"/>
degenerating into this late acute
Sickness.</p>
               <p>Let this suffice in General, to give a
Premonition and Caveat of a future

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est for our premunition. Touching
the Signs that attend the Pest, that it
is present, they are manifold all or most
of which are maturely to be considered,
that we may attain a perfect Diagnôsis
of this Heteroclite Calamity, and
withall make a Prognôsis for a discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
what is like to be the event thereof.
And here I must take notice what a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous
complication, contexture and
mutual entercourse there is of the Signs
belonging to the Pest, and other Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
especially the Scorbute; so that
he ought to be very quick-sighted, that
can sometimes rightly distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
one and the other: Wherefore
in delivering Judgment concerning a
doubtful matter, all Circumstances are
strictly to be observed, and a Syndrom
of Symptoms to be mustered together,
that what a single cannot, a collective
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53574:38"/>
Enumeration of Signs may instruct us
in the Nature and Essence of that kind
of Languor which hath seized upon the
Patient. When therefore an Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> a Loathing,
Vomiting, a Vertigo, great pain of the
Head, a notable redness in the veins of
the conjunctive Tunicle, difficult or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Respiration, a great asperity of
the Tongue, extream Thirst, or no
Thirst considerable; a Soporous, or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargical
Disposition, Agrypnie, Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness
and Inquietude, a Misapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
false Conception of things; a
delirium or raving, a Faintness, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation
of the Heart, and Lipothymie;
a Stupor and Numness in several parts,
Spontaneous Trembling, Lassitude, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate
changes of heat and cold, shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pains especially in the Emunctories,
Eruption of Blanes, Vesicles, Spots,
Botches, Carbuncles, an obscure or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
Feaver, sometimes violent, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
gentle, the pulse weak, unequal,
intermitting, formicant, or vermicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53574:38"/>
a laudable well-coloured Urine,
not at all discovering any evil affect,
when many, or most of these Signs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
especially when the Disease is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant,
an able Physitian may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
assert, That the sick man hath a
Pestilential poyson within him. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
is he that meets with such a Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
that can detect in a seasonable time
this subtle Serpent that lieth hid in the
bosom, that he may bruise his head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it infect by his noysom breath the
greatest part of the vital Spirits, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
a free circulation of the blood, by
causing a restagnation, and coagulation
of the same; for while the Pest is <hi>in
fieri,</hi> potent Remedies being duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred,
do seldom miss or their right
scope of Curing; but when it comes
to be <hi>in facto esse,</hi> the Recovery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
very hazardous. For this reason
I have urged some persons that would
listen to me, whom I have suspected to
have received the Infection, for <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
to take what might give a check to its
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53574:39"/>
full Career, stopping it <hi>in limine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it entred into the Bedchamber of
life; and so successful have I been this
way, that in a few hours there hath been
by vertue of some active Remedies, an
Epiphany and Efflorescence of some
Spot, Tubercule, Vesicle, Bubo, or the
like on the skin, which hath both satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Patient, by a timely prevention
of future mischief, and confirmed my
Judgment with credit. In some I have
at first so taken off the force of the
Venom, by the frequent use of purified
Sulphurs, that it could never so seize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the blood, as to put any considerable
stop to its motion; so that hereby, not
the least cutaneous Emersion could be
discovered, as it happened to my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who had the Pest twice, with a
Feaver, Vertigo, Oppression at the
Stomack, and other evident Symptoms
belonging thereto; and yet had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Botch, Carbuncle, Blane, Vesicle,
Pimple, or Spot apparent in his whole
Body: And though, as he told me, he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53574:39"/>
felt about a Hundred times for a Bubo
in his Groin, the virulent, tartarous
blood tending that way, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it could never gather to make any
Tumor; forasmuch as it was still ferret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
subtiliated, and dissipated by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
that were volatile, and capable to
be circulated with the blood, and to be
carried as far as the sixth digestion; and
there to execute the office of discussing
any gross leutous matter, without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a <hi>Caput mort</hi> behind. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the advice of the Poet, <hi>Principiis
obsta,</hi> is to be embraced in any Disease,
but especially this, which being <hi>morbus
per peracutus,</hi> quickly finishes its course,
(when it once sets forth) and hastens
to a period oftentimes in a few hours.
Seeing therefore it treads so softly
within us, that it cannot be heard to
walk; remains sometimes so silent,
that it speaks little or nothing that we
can understand for our instruction, 'tis
wisdom to send out some <hi>Exploratores
perspicaces,</hi> subtle Scouts, I mean, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53574:40"/>
Medicines, that by their lepto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery
and specifick Dowry implanted
in them, may search out and discover
whatsoever is hostile in our Territories,
heating up the Quarters of that close
Enemy which lies in perdu to destroy us
<hi>ex improviso.</hi> Wherefore if any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Errour be committed by any in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
or any outward thing that is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no support our life, let there be a
timely prevention of the ill effects
thereof. And although 'tis true, that
there is no sign in the Pest which may
not appear in another sickness, yet when
such a Contagion is grassant, and many
of the forenamed Symptoms shew
themselves, though very obscurely, we
have just cause to censure it to be of this
kind, and to withstand the same with
Curatives sutable to the magnitude and
activity thereof. Much likewise is to
be gathered from some Adjuncts and
Circumstances annexed to virulent
Symptoms and Products that may spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
their Nature from what root they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53574:40"/>
spring, and shew that they are not of
the Classis of those that are mild and
gentle; for pestilential Bubo's, Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
Carbuncles and Blanes often
break forth before any considerable
Feaver on a sudden, and are far more
painful than others that are well-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
Any small cutaneous Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
as a Vesicle, or some vexatious
Pimple, somewhat unusual to us in
time of mortal Contamination, though
no Feaver, nor any other bad Symptoms
shew themselves, ought to dictate to us
what may be the worse, that nothing
may be neglected conducing to the
breaking this Cockatrice Egg in the
beginning.</p>
               <p>In short, any sudden Alteration ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in us in time of Contagion, and no
solid Reason to be given for it, may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well inform us, that we are intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and our Spirits infected by this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocious
Arrow. A defect of a custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Diaphoresis, and a kindly perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the whole body, especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53574:41"/>
Morning, ought to make us sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious,
and to move us to use all means
to open the Pores by Diaphoretical and
Diapuoick Alexiteries. Whether this
poyson entered into us from without by
Contact or Respiration? and whether
it took its original from an inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Malignity, is often hard to
deem? yet sometimes there ariseth a
manifest change, punction and dolour in
that part where it had the first ingress,
and some remarkable impression made
Topically, as it happened in an obscure
manner to my hand, which was for some
time demerged and souzed in the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
liquamen of a pestilent Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass,
that had at that time retained a
heat in the bowels. Expedite and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
is that Pest which is framed by
a strong imagination of a fright in the
Individual, for it often absolves a fatal
History in a very short time, but what
proceeds from a Terrour of the Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
ingenite in every particular part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it have more danger in it, yet
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53574:41"/>
it begins and makes it progress a little
more leisurely for the most part, giving
fairer warning, which I ought to have
taken more notice of, when those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
Atoms entered into my hand
at the time of the Dissection of such an
infecting Cadaver.</p>
               <p>Touching the event of the Pest that
hath seized upon any person as to make
a Prognôsis thereof forthwith infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is scarce granted to any Physician,
it being a meer Proteus, turning Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeleon
like, into all shapes of life and
death; for where there seems most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
there is most danger; and when
the Symptoms are most direful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
a happy conclusion of Sanity
sometimes follows.</p>
               <p>Thus much I have frequently obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that a very laudable Urine, like to
one healthy, is oftentimes the worse;
and the more mild the Accidents ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to us, in the greater hazard is that
mans life! That which I alwayes prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
depend upon, to give a solid
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53574:42"/>
Judgment what may be the conclusion
of this Scene, for better or worse, is
the strength or weakness of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
the Maturity or Tardity of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to him; for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
is highly to be prized above all, if he be
able and honest. From hence I take
my Indication to perform my Duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ascertain'd, that <hi>Nature sunt Morbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
medicatrices,</hi> nothing where the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Spirits do altogether fail can be
done; wherefore in this case of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Prediction, a good Physitian
ought to be guided chiefly by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of some potent <hi>Arcana</hi>'s, which
if they be rightly ordered, and seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
given, will inform him how long,
and with what success this universal <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi>
Governor of this Fortress, is able
to hold out, and by what wayes sallying
forth upon the Enemy it can rout, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate,
and cut it off. Whosoever is
not furnished with extraordinary Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
shall find that Aphorism of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
true, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
That is, in acute
Diseases there is no infallible Prediction
whether the sick man will live or dye;
which I confess trusting to a <hi>Galenical
Crisis</hi> I have experimentally found to
be true: but he that by premature Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
doth anticipate the same, shall
seldom Err in his prenotion for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and credit of this Divine Art, and
Confirmation of the faith of the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by in him that undertakes the Cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know my Countreymen will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
my Judgment, what I think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the state and condition of this
approaching Summer, Whether the Pest
be like to break forth in this City in a
raging manner again? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
Negatively:</hi> So far as I can Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
by Natural Reasons, taken from the
ordinary course of all things, which I
observe have their first Rise, an Ascent,
an utmost Height, a Descent, and then a
Setting. I have perceived the late Pest
to be Ambulatory, to make a progress from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53574:43"/>
place to place; and having made havock
in one Topical Quarter, after some abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it removed to another; which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
plainly, that there are local seminal
Dispositions prone to produce this peculiar
poyson at such a time above others, which
as it ripens sooner or later, and finds our
Bodies inclined to receive an Impression,
so according to our Capacity it breaks
forth into Act, speedily or slowly, mildly
or fiercely. Now the pestilent matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in great part exhausted and spent,
the Scorbutical malignity somewhat tamed,
and the Archeus fortified, daring, becomes
as it were an old Souldier, not ready as
formerly to give back upon every terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Occasion; I may confidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That <hi>London</hi> is like to enjoy this
Summer the Company of the <hi>Galenists,</hi>
when there is least need of them; which
will I fear be an ill <hi>Omen</hi> to some, so
long as they continue Bleeding, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letery
Purgation, more destructive to poor
Mortals, than all the Pests that ever
reigned since the Creation!</p>

HISTORICAL ACCOUNT
OF THE
DISSECTION
OF A
Pestilential Body;
And the Consequents thereof. CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>IN the Year 1665. a most ruefull
lamentable time as ever <hi>London</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in this kinde, when the Sickness
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53574:44"/>
swept away many Thousands in a week
in the Moneth of <hi>August,</hi> I visited a
lusty proper man, by name Mr. <hi>Wil: Pick,</hi>
living in <hi>Peticoat-lane,</hi> grievously woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with one of those poisonous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
that flew thick about poor Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls:
so that his condition seemed to
be almost desperate, and finding no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
at all from those frivolous and vain
preparations a <hi>Galenist</hi> had exhibited to
him <hi>usque ad nauseam:</hi> was in some
short space preserved by Chimical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies:
the poison being therewith
excluded, and the Archeus of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
redeemed from captivity. At
the same time there lay a Servant of
Mr. <hi>Picks,</hi> a youth about 15 yeares of
age, labouring under most horrid sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes,
raving as it were extimulated
by some Fury; which Tragical Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
was quickly terminated by a mortal
Catastrophe. Upon this, I took occasion
to request my then recovering Patient
his Master, to grant me liberty to open
this defunct body; for my own instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53574:44"/>
and the satisfaction of all inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Persons, to which, having given
him some perswasive reasons to that
purpose, he strait condescended, yet
not without some jealousie and kind
fear least I should do my self injury;
upon his concession I being much exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larated
in my spirits, having obtained
that desire which was often denyed me
by those who pretended several slight
excuses, I girt up my self with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
getting in readiness what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
were fitting, with a porrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
containing Sulphur to burn under
the Corps, which was at that time pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the open air in a yard there adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
which for several respects was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
convenient; and for my better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
a Servant by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the foresaid Master was ready
to afford me his service, in opening the
Coffin nailed up, and administring some
other things necessary for my design.
The head of the Coffin being taken off,
and the linnen cleared away, I could not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53574:45"/>
but admire, to behold a skin so beset
with spots black and blew, more remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
for multitude and magnitude than
any that I have yet seen; some of which
being opened, conteined a congealed
matter, in one more shallow, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more deep. Here I conceived
something more than of ordinary Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
might be discovered; wherefore
perforating the Membrane that involved
all the rest, I made entrance into the
lowest venter or Region, where appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a virulent Ichor, or thin liquor vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
coloured, as yellow, greenish, &amp;c.
the small guts being much distended
with a venemous flatus, did contain a
great quantity of a foul scoria or dross
in them; but they were not, as some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
outwardly spotted as the
skin; only some obscure large markes
were made in their inward parts, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the stomach, arising from the
poisonous liquamen therein lodged.
The <hi>Vena Porta</hi> and <hi>Arteria Caeliaca</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divided, afforded only a serous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53574:45"/>
no rubified juice at all; that which
was inclosed in these vessels, was a firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
congealed substance of a very dark
colour; the Parenchyma of the Liver
being separated was very pallid, and did
straight weep and send out a thin yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish
excrement. The Spleen dissected,
appeared more then ordinary obscure,
a livid Ichorous matter following the
Incision: the Kidneys laid open aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with a Citrine water, but altogether
exanguine, as likewise the other <hi>viscera;</hi>
at length I came to that most excellent
usefull part, the Stomack, whose ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
membranes when I had divided, a
black matter like Ink did shew it self,
to the quantity (as nigh as I could guess)
of a wine pint, somewhat tenacious and
slimy: the inward membrane of the
Ventricle was much discoloured, but
the bottom thereof not perforated, as
<hi>Helmont</hi> found in the like case: in such
a manner (sayes he) as if a potential cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
had been applied therto. Having
sufficiently lustrated and viewed the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53574:46"/>
lower venter, I ascended to the middle,
and making a divulsion of the sterne
from the <hi>Mediastinum,</hi> I intentively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the superficies of the Lungs, stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized
with several large ill favoured
marks much tumified and distended: the
inward part of which being pertunded
with my knife, a sanious dreggy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
issued forth, and a pale Ichor
destitute of any blood, for which I sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by cutting this Organ of respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
into various particles, but could
finde none but a dirty coagulation,
which <hi>Hipocrates</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the
branches of <hi>Vena</hi> and <hi>Arteria Pulmonica.</hi>
After this I disparted the descending
Trunck of the <hi>Cava,</hi> and the Artery
called <hi>Aorta,</hi> expecting some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
emanation of blood there, if any
where, that might make a little inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
but no such thing succeeded, for
only some very few spoonfulls of a thin
liquor of a pale hew came forth, which
might easily be licked up by a small
handkerchief. Diffecting these pipes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53574:46"/>
                  <hi>secundum rectitudinem,</hi> I found them
stuffed with a thick curdled blackish
substance, which once laid hold on might
be drawn out to some length. Next I
seperated the Pericardium, that robust
coat that circumvolves the Heart, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
with a deeply tinged yellow
liquor: Then having opened the right
cavity of the Heart, I therein found a
white congealed matter, extracting
which with my fingers, and narrowly
viewing it, I could not compare it to
any thing more like, than a Lamb-stone
cut in twain, which the Servant behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
standing nigh, easily assented to
in his Judgement. To render a sound
reason of this albified coagulation in this
right Ventricle of the Heart, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
puzzle a good Physiologist. For
in all those cadavers I ever saw dissect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
this hollow receptacle did still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a blackish blood condensed, arising
from a stopping of the Circulation of
it first in that place. Now the most
probable cause (as I conceive, with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission)
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53574:47"/>
of this unwonted white sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
may come from a sumption of
meer crude milk, which an indiscreet
Nurse had given this youth not long
before he died, part of which passing
out of the stomach little altered, might
be conveyed, upon a pinch and stress to
preserve life, through the <hi>Venae lacteae</hi>
in the Mesenterie, or some shorter pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
into the subclavian vessels, and
there entring the right cavity of the
Heart, be (for want of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
that sanguifying power, and that mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
transmuting ferment attending it)
changed according to the capacity of
the Matter by a virulent preternatural
ferment, into this seeming glandulous
flesh. 'Twas strange to behold instead
of candid, a black fuiiginous matter; fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
only for the infernal stomach of the
Dogg <hi>Cerberus</hi> inclosed in one ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
that publike shop and treasury of
life, that ought to be furnished with all
manner of utensils requisite for the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation
of this little world: and in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53574:47"/>
another a white innocent lamb-like juice
lodged, instead of a duskie concreted
clot of gore, and all this proceeding
from the deletery ferment of this Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roclite
poison; which, that I may give
you a further account, had so altered the
substance, texture, consistence, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of that Solar Nectar contained in
those curiously contrived Pipes, veins,
and arteries, that I may truly say not
one spoonfull of that ruddy liquor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called blood could be obtained in
this Pestilential body, being partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed,
and partly colliquated into a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum</hi>
or filthy matter: Which I have
experimentally found to be the usual ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of those poisons I have given to
some Creatures, whose carcasses I have
afterward dissected.</p>
               <p>Having finished the Dissection of
this loathsom Body, I presently found
some little sensible alteration tending to
a stiffness and numness in my hand,
which had been soaking and dabling in
the Bowels and Entrals then warm,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53574:48"/>
though it was Ten or Twelve hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Youth expired; whereupon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cleansed away that foulness it was
besmeared with, I held it for some time
over a dish of burning Brimstone, and
so received the Gas thereof, but in vain.
<hi>Seriùs ejicitur, quam non admittitur;</hi> I
might better (had I foreseen what I do
now) kept it out, than thrust it out;
for those slie, insinuating, venemous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
excited by the heat of the body,
opening the pores of my skin, had
quickly free ingress; the Archeus, the
Porter of my hand, that should have
better guarded it, forthwith tergiversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and taking its flight, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
terrified at the Alarum of so
fierce and potent an Enemy, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in an abject manner conducted it
to the principal place of the Souls resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the Stomack; where after this
lately entered poyson had dressed and
habited it self with that spirit that had
the perfect Idea and Image of this sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it was to act a Tragical part (the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53574:48"/>
Archeus being obliged to be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
to bring to pass its own Ruine)
and now do I carry about me the very
Pest, closely spreading like a Gangrene,
diffusing its malignity into all my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
covered over for some short space
as it were in the ashes of silence, while
I in the mean time visited, visit others
visited, administring that help to them,
which I (then more perplexed at my
Neighbours Calamity, than sollicitous
for my own) suffer my self to want,
relating with joy what an Inquest I had
made into that Subject which had made
a Conquest of me.</p>
               <p>Thus I walked up and down from
Patient to Patient, <hi>Dum hoc virus mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra
mea depascitur.</hi> I ate, I drank, and
slept well till about Two of the Clock
the next Morning being <hi>Saturday,</hi> at
which hour I waked to sleep for ever,
had not Divine goodness given me an
Antidote to rouze and raise me up,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, no sooner had I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
myself, but I perceived such a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53574:49"/>
kind of stupor in my Thighs and Legs
that was at first in my hand, then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ponder what I had done the day
before; and still those large and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
Spots were too lively represented
to my eye against my will: Without
further delay, I forthwith called up my
Servant, a Stripling, nigh Fourteen
years old, whom I commanded (having
lighted a Candle) strictly to observe
those Directions I gave him, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such Remedies to be produced with
all speed that I knew were very suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and valid by multiplicity of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
to resist this feral Disease. And
when I had delivered to him such Rules
I thought necessary for life; having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a large quantity of my best Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments,
I charged him to follow me
close, doubling and trebling the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Dose I usually gave; which he so
faithfully and sedulously performed
with advantage, that I dare assert that
Five of my Patients joined altogether,
never did through my whole practice
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53574:49"/>
high these Twenty years, take so great
a portion of such like Remedies, as it
appeared by his own, and others reports,
compared with that great expence of
those preparations I had in store; for I
knew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was so prostrate, and the Disease so
strong, it was to be supported by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
help; which course, had it not
been vigorously taken, I question (had
there been delay of what was needful
for my recovery but two hours) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any Medicine in Nature could have
been of any efficacy and validity for my
Restauration, such was the Magnitude,
Activity and Celerity (pardon my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
good Mr. Captious <hi>Logoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
and let not one single term without
any true saving knowledge breed a
quarrel between us) I say properly, the
Celerity (in despight of any self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
cavilling <hi>Galenist)</hi> of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
that then invaded me, that would
admit of no Truce or Respite: For so
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53574:50"/>
soon as I was throughly awakened, I
felt a grievous oppression about the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driff,
especially in the pit of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack;
and such a sudden defection of
the Spirits, that I had much ado to hold
out to advertise my Servant how he
should menage his business. My head
also began to be much out of order, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
dozed; and whereas Three
or four Ounces of a Cordial liquor I
took formerly, did commonly put me
into a breathing Sweat, now ten times
so much of the same did hardly cause a
heat in the lower parts. Perspicuous
also was the Coagulation of part of my
blood, as many small Stigmata, Spots
scattered about my Breast and Arms, did
plainly testifie; but one above the rest
was most remarkable in the bending of
my right Arm, where there appeared a
very large Spot of an obscure colour,
of the bigness of a single Half-penny,
which I often took a view of. Well,
after some hours tedious Inquietude,
and despondency of Spirit, with much
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53574:50"/>
Reluctancy, and many an Agony, a
gentle Mador at length bedewed my
skin, with which I was somewhat relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and persevering in the frequent
repetition of <hi>Polyacaea</hi> and some other
noble Remedies, I began to be much
refreshed, sweating liberally <hi>cum empho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riâ
&amp; dysphoriâ</hi> by turnes; for I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
sustained <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ah Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate
Vicissrtude of desperate and
hopefull Symptomes: there being
sometimes an <hi>Eclampfis,</hi> a seeming se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity
and clarity in the Archeus: then
again nothing but Cloudiness, Storms
and Tempests.</p>
               <p>Thus I passed over that dolefull mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>inter spemque metumque,</hi> earnestly
longing for the presence of that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
expert Chymist and legitimate Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
Dr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> whom I sent to,
being verily perswaded, that he, if any,
under God, would be a Comforter to
me, (for I knew certainly that the best
<hi>Galenist</hi> was a miserable one, and that
<hi>Spiritus Antiloimoides</hi> was a meer cheat)
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53574:51"/>
                  <hi>sed heu lachrymabile! ambo morbo labora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
eodem,</hi> he was stricken, and had as
much need of mine, as I of his succour,
and so we might condole, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
each other. However this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Gentleman came to me, whose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Aspect exhilarated and solaced my
drooping spirits; of whom when I had
taken something, I was wonderfully
composed for some time. This brave
man, (that did, I dare maintain it, more
good than all the <hi>Galenists</hi> in <hi>England</hi>
put together) was that night after he
had been with me, forced to yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
prisoner to that insolent Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
which did then make spoil of many
Thousands; and so I was left destitute
of two of my dearest friends in my sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Condition; For Honest and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> of whom I shall speak fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hereafter, could not afford me his
Assistance, being much afflicted and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
(after a former deliverance) with
the same venemous Sickness. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I resolved to make use of that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53574:51"/>
I was then master of, and that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
aid I had then at hand, uniting and
mustering up all supplies that I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
were proper for me, laying aside all
peevishness and foolish averseness to
take what was fitting; which fault I
often found incident to most of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
to their own prejudice. The
Remedies that I took in a Quintuple
quantity for what others took, was
<hi>Tinctura Polyacaea,</hi> and no small porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Pulvis Pestifugus.</hi> Touching the
Diet I observed, it was good spirituous
liquors, as the best Wine, and Strong
Beer sweetned with a little sugar, also
now and then I drank a draught of
White-wine Posset: as for <hi>Galenical</hi>
Juleps, Small beer, Barly water, muc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caginous
Decoctions, Broths, satiated
with the crude juice of Ingredients, I
detested; for I knew they would annoy
my stomach, and so hinder the Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
from conquering the poyson, which
upon every irritating occasion was ready
to ferment. My whole scope was to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53574:52"/>
keep up the strength of the vital spirits,
without which I am sure no Maladie can
be cured. Neither was I wanting to
make use of <hi>Helmonts Xenexton,</hi> a Toad,
the powder of which my dear friend Dr.
<hi>Starkey</hi> gave me, made up in the form
of a Trochisk of his own ordering: I
likewise hung about my neck a large
Toad dried, prepared not long before
in as exquisite a manner as possibly I
could, with my own fingers: This
Toad sowed up in a linnen cloth was
placed about the Region of my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
where after it had remained some
hours, became so tumefied, distended,
(as it were blown up) to that bignesse,
that it was an object of wonder to those
that beheld it. Had I not felt and seen
this swollen dead body of the Toad, I
should very much have doubted by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
the Truth thereof; forasmuch as
that Great Scholar in reality, <hi>Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
(who shines with such a bright
lustre in his Orb, that the <hi>Galenical</hi>
Bats and Owls are not able to look him
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53574:52"/>
in the face) delivers these words; <hi>Nam
Buso exsiccatus utut sex horis maceretur,
semper tamen tumefactionis incapax,</hi> i. e.
A dried Toad, though it be steeped in
water for six hours together, will not
for all that be swollen or puffed up.
This he speaks for the confutation of
<hi>Paracelsus,</hi> who tells us, That a dried
Toad macerated and softened in Rose-water
for six hours together, doth draw
the Pestilential poyson so into its body,
that five or six Bufo's laid on one after
another upon a Botch, will all be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
tumefied: This, saith <hi>Van
Helmont,</hi> can never be, <hi>quod intumesce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
sit proprietas Archei vitalis, quod non
nisi occasionaliter tumor à venenis proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat.</hi>
Where the Vital Archeus is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
there can be no swelling from any
poyson, <hi>quatenus</hi> a poyson: for every
tumour from poyson happens <hi>occasiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litèr,</hi>
or <hi>excitativè,</hi> in as much as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites,
exasperates, and causes an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in the <hi>Archesus,</hi> which being thus
irritated and quite disordered, frets, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53574:53"/>
storms, and in this distracted mad
fit produces such or such accidents and
symptomes, as the natural Idea of the
specifick venom shall direct and inform
it. Again, <hi>Non tumet</hi> (sayes the Acute
Author) <hi>Cadaver ictum à serpente: Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daver
namque si non senserint nec tumefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendi
energiam retinuit;</hi> A Carckasse
for as much as it is deprived of all sense,
is uncapable of tumefaction from poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
which doubtlesse is sound Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
never read or heard of from a <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenist,</hi>
for medicinal Instruction, till this
Privy Counsellor of Nature discovered
it. This rightly understood, might
serve as a good Argument to convince
these Dogmatists, that poysonous Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicatories
do but disturb Nature, and
take it off from performing a Sanative
Office, (if rightly assisted by Art) and
divert it from that intended scope of
profligating the pestilential poyson, to
spend it self in opposing another, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
by a company of Impostors, to
delude Ignorant persons, under a notion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53574:53"/>
of drawing out the disease by these Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
which are raised in all living bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
healthfull as well as sick, from a
colliquating venome that <hi>Cantharides</hi>
have inherent in them, vexing and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the <hi>Archeus</hi> of the membranous
parts, that it even changes the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and mild blood into such a sharp
mischievous <hi>Ichor,</hi> that a <hi>Dysuria</hi> or <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churia,</hi>
a great pain or stopping of the
Urine frequently follows; but this <hi>obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
I shall hereafter make a larger dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of this daubing with untempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
mortar, and those palliating deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
courses that are daily imposed upon
Credulous weak persons. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed:
when I contemplate the foresaid
words of this great Philosopher, a man
of that transcendent Reason, and that
clear bright Understanding; I am not a
little puzled to find out the Efficient &amp;
Material Cause of the vast tumefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this <hi>Bufo</hi> incumbent on my breast.
That simple water of it self will not puff
up a dried <hi>Bufo</hi> to that bulk ready to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53574:54"/>
burst, is plain, by the Experiment of
the Noble Author, and my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
Also a dead <hi>Bufo</hi> for want of a
vital <hi>Archeus,</hi> cannot suffer such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion
of parts from a venome never so
active and pernicious to it, (as a <hi>Spider</hi>
is reported to be) considering meer
poysons are little considerable <hi>in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
but <hi>in quali:</hi> neither is Mans pest
poysonous to a <hi>Bufo,</hi> no more than it is
to a <hi>Dogg</hi> or <hi>Catt,</hi> to whom it is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous;
Wherefore I suppose; till I be
better informed, that some virulent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations
(either expelled by Nature,
strengthened with the presence of the
<hi>Bufo,</hi> or attracted by Magnetism) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
with them a transmutative putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive
ferment imbibed by the <hi>Cadaver,</hi>
might attenuate, rarifie, and hove up
the easily dilatable particles of the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo,</hi>
and might (the ambient heat of the
Bed being coadjuvant) cause this kind
of flatuous extension: which <hi>Apor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaa's</hi>
being afterwards spent, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
application of another <hi>Bufo</hi> of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53574:54"/>
the same magnitude, prepared after the
same manner, menaged with the like
Circumstances, suffered no such tume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
alteration, which doubtlesse could
never be, had there been the same ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate
cause present which was before.
Well, be the Cause never so abstruse, I
am sufficiently perswaded, That the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of this Bufo nigh my Stomack,
was of wonderful force to master and
tame this Venom then domineering in
me, and thereby subjugate it to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of the vital Spirit, somewhat
more pacified and freed by degrees from
that hotrid, deformed, pestilential Idea
imprinted in it; so that it was enabled
to proscribe part of that tartarous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
through a place most oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
(but not often frequented by such
an evacuation) the Fundament, where
appeared in some few dayes a very great
<hi>Bubo</hi> of the bigness of a Tennis-ball,
quite stopping up the passage of the
<hi>Anus.</hi> My Head being now pretty well
setled, I was better able than before to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53574:55"/>
reflect upon my self, and to consult
more rationally for my own safety;
wherefore after some serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of my present condition, I thought
it fitting to give vent to this Tumor, and
to let out immediately the foul gore
conteined therein.</p>
               <p>For this end I sent to an honest indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
young man (a great lover of
<hi>Chimistry,</hi> one who was lately convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by Fact of the Truth therein) desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to apply Leeches to this swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which he performed with much
dexterity, Three <hi>Sanguisugae</hi> having
filled themselves <hi>usque ad nauseam,</hi>
a filthy, corrupt, blackish, ichorous,
staining Recrement issued forth, much
like that I found in the Cadaverous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section.
By this Excretion I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
Recreated; Nature discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every day a great quantity of viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
moisture for the space of nigh three
Weeks.</p>
               <p>Thus continuing the frequent use of
<hi>Tinctura Polyacaea,</hi> and good spirituous
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53574:55"/>
Liquors, I lay in a perpetual large Sweat
Six dayes compleat, sometimes deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
almost Lipothymical, and as it were
dead in the Nest upon a reflux of the
Venom to the Central parts; and then
again upon its Efflux to the <hi>Peripheria,</hi>
the Circumference of the Skin forth-with
elevated, chearful and lively. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sixth day I arose, and walked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Chamber with so firm a foot,
that my Brother and others wondred at
the strength of my progressive motion;
that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>impetum faciens,</hi> the
vital Spirit being kept up with good
Liquors, and pure Chymical circulated
Spirits, agreeable to our Nature: And I
am perswaded, upon the first setting my
Foot upon the Floor after this sickness
(had not that painful Swelling in the
Fundament hindred) I could firmly
have walked a Mile out-right; which
thing (considering the Atrocity and
Outragiousness of the Disease, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Circumstances) if ever it was, or
will be performed by meer <hi>Galenical
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53574:56"/>
Physick,</hi> I will be bound to undergo Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
for the approbation and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their way as best.</p>
               <p>Upon the Eighth day I went down
Stairs to visit my Landlady Mrs. <hi>Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
most dangerously ill; who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
her abortion, miscarrying,
was saved from the Grave, by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
hand, working by Chymical
Remedies. No sooner was I got up,
but my Maid-servant, and my Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
about Thirteen years old, fell
down, being wounded with the same
Arrow, both of which escaped through
a blessing upon the means. That Four
in one House should have the Pest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the same time, and all escape when
it raged most Mortally, is a Mercy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be forgotten by us!</p>
               <p>Having recovered the Ferment of my
Stomack in great part, enioying a sharp
Appetite, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
having lost my flesh suddenly, I thought
I might according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> advice,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, get it again as spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53574:56"/>
                  <hi>Sed difficile est modum tenere;</hi>
I went beyond the bounds of Sobriety,
eating and drinking too liberally, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
I could correct a small Errour at
my pleasure, forgetting <hi>Hippocrates</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorism,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
And going abroad too soon, out of a
Zeal to visit my Patients, being not
throughly rid of a relique of Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that lay lurking within me, and
something more perhaps added by those
loathsom Expirations of the Sick I was
conversant with (a Scald head being
soon broken) I fell into a most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Relapse with great oppression at
my Stomack, a Loosness, difficulty of
Respiration, exceeding weakness, Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness,
fruitless Sweating, &amp;c. So that
I thought it not possible to hold out
that Night; but this wanzing, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to go out spark of life was once more
blown up to a flame by that comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
refreshing blast of former Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Remedies, repeated in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53574:57"/>
and so in four dayes I made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
evasion from my tedious Bed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
to be more cautious for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
I was fully confirmed in my
health, for which benefit I hope I shall
be grateful to the most High, <hi>Dum Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
hos regit artus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that very time, whil'st I did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
many a sad Brunt, many a trepidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the heart, and conflict of Spirit,
two of my most esteemed Consorts,
Dr. <hi>Ioseph Dey,</hi> and Dr. <hi>George Starkey,</hi>
two Pillars of <hi>Chymical Physick,</hi> were
both reposed in their Graves, before I
knew of their Deaths, concealed on
purpose from me, lest upon the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of so great a loss, my Calamity
should be aggravated, and I swallowed
up in the gulph of Despair. They are
gone, and at rest free from Persecution,
Slanders and Obloquies of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and have left me behind to deal
with those that are alwayes supplanting
and contradicting the Truth. Well, I
must be content, considering, <hi>Quicquid
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53574:57"/>
patimur venit ab Alto:</hi> This came not
out of the Dust, but from the hand of
him Above, who for our abominable
Crimes, and our Ingratitude, the grand
Sin of this Nation, was pleased to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of Two such eminent Lights,
of which this wicked World is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
unless they could have prized
them better. 'Tis not for my own so
much, though great, as for the publick
interest, that I heartily lament the
Translation of these two brave Souls
into a better place, whose Praises all
Candid and Ingenuous men will, I dare
say, Celebrate; and none but Sordid,
Envious, Ignorant Spirits, will ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from them. It was, I confess, a
most unhappy malevolent juncture of
things at that instant, that we should all
Three fall sick at the same time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of us being able to relieve each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for, I am perswaded, had Divine
Providence been pleased to have spared
any one of us from the severe stroke of
his Indignation, we might have been at
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53574:58"/>
this day all three alive; for 'tis the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this fly Venome to strike so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
at the brain, and to cause such an
<hi>adiathesis,</hi> a discomposure, and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
in that Organ, that a man hath
not free libetty of his Reason, to act
what may be convenient for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his own life; as it was too apparent
in these Physicians of singular Parts.
One of whom, <hi>i. e.</hi> Dr. <hi>Dey</hi> I visited in
the Evening, a little after I had Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized
the Body, relating to him what
I had done, which he was much delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to hear.</p>
               <p>At my departure from him (that
night I was surprized with the Pest) he
seemed chearfull, having felt about a
fortnight before the smart of this pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
stroak, of which he was healed,
and so had likewise upon this second en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
had he not been too ventrous
to save others, rather than his own life:
such was the true Charity of this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Honest Gentleman towards his
neighbour; for he eviscerated and spent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53574:58"/>
himself in toylsom Manual Operations,
leaving the way of Riches, Honour,
Pleasure and Ease his Colleagues trod
in, (having been admitted one of the
Colledge of <hi>London</hi> about twenty
years) whom he deserted, to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
in this World, for Conscience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake,
abominating their indirect and
destructive manner of Practice, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Professors thereof (as he often
told me) to be quite out of the way of
Curing Diseases. He was a Learned
Scholar in deed as well as word; a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Modest, Charitable, Humble
Man, so farr free from Ostentation and
Vain-glory, that he hid his Excellent
parts, when other of his Brethren, farr
inferiour to him, made ten times the
glittering shew. He took such labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
pains night and day in his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that I am certain he exhausted his
Spirits, and thereby disenabled the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheaus
to resist the Contagion. <hi>Caren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
non fruendo agnoscimus;</hi> He hath his
<hi>Exit</hi> with applause, and is wanted by
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53574:59"/>
many, that better value him now, than
when they enjoyed him.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Starkey</hi> one of the Triumvirate,
that was then infected when he came to
me, having his Imagination dislocated,
yeelded himself Prisoner to this Cruel
Enemy that very night, being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his Groin, a Bubo appearing
there, which I conceive, if rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
might have been a meanes to
have saved him, had he not poured in
an unreasonable quantity of Small beer.
After which understanding what he had
done, he told those then present, That
all the Medicines that he had in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were of no force to do him any good;
for the natural ferment of the Stomach
was by this immoderate ingurgitation
of dull flat Small beer totally subverted,
the poyson exalted, the Archeus debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated,
the blood made restagnant
and congealed, and the pores thereby
obstructed, that no considerable <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeresis</hi>
could be made. I have reason
to beleeve, that had Dr. <hi>Starkey</hi> made
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53574:59"/>
use of his own Noble Chymical prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in the beginning, and followed
them close, as I did, it had been no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
thing for himself to have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
that had an extraordinary Gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on him of Curing others in a far
worse condition then he was reported
to be. But for my part I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that being very sensible of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
hypocrisie, dishonesty, the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
subtile Frauds, disrespect of Real
worth, odious Ingratitude, and other
notorious Crimes of the Times, he was
willing to resign himself to Death, so
that he was not much sollicitous to live.
'Tis a thousand pitties, that a man of
those excellent parts had no better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
and more kind usage here,
that he might have composed and setled
himself to a further investigation of
those Chymical mysteries, into which
hardly any in this Nation had a greater
inspection. The Spagyrical Republike
and the Professors thereof are not a little
obliged to him, and have reason (if
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53574:60"/>
they be not ungracious and ungratefull)
to speak of his memorable Name, with
Respect and Honour; and he that shall
do the contrary, will savour of a <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi>
spirit; and ought to be reckoned
among those his unworthy seeming
Friends, whom out of a sweet flexible
nature, and a hearty desire to do good
for Mankinde, he taught many Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Arcana's: for which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
him with persecution, calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and base detracting language. It
was his fate, as likewise Dr. <hi>Deys,</hi> to be
evill entreated, and slighted, because
they could not cogg, lye, and flatter;
<hi>&amp; haec est ars quâ quivis possit ditescere:</hi>
and he that cannot do so in this leprous
age of the world, wherein mens minds

               <p>They scorned that reward which the

               <p>There is one thing, the truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I cannot omit to give the World sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in, in reference to these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
of Chymistry. Whereas there
was a confident Report (the broachers
of which it is no difficulty to conjecture)
that Dr. <hi>Dey,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> were both
present at the Dissection of this Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Body: It is an absolute untruth,
contrived on purpose to represent them
presumptuous rash Persons, in underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
such a desperate businesse, which
cost them both their lives, as they
would have it, that thereby the good
estimation and fame of Chymical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
may be eclipsed: and the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
of one of their own Sect (who
upon the like Occasion lost his life, as
I have told them in <hi>Galeno-pale,</hi> for
want of a Remedie which an <hi>Helmontist</hi>
could have given him) the better excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
I question not, as I have it from
their own mouthes, but either of those
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53574:61"/>
Gentlemen would willingly have joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with me in this Anatomy, had not
the Opportunity offered to me occured
so unexpectedly, that I could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
gain any leisure to send to
them. Moreover they were both sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
upon by this Truculent Disease,
before I entred upon this Dissection:
so that Dr. <hi>Dey</hi> was not capable to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
me therein, being infirm; and Dr.
<hi>Starkey</hi> went to and fro with this mortal
Arrow sticking in his side unfelt: and
withall, so great was his employment,
and medicinal negotiation at that time,
that it was both hard to finde him out,
and likewise to divert him from those
engagements of visiting his Patients he
had taken upon him. Wherefore I
thought good to lay hold alone, of that
seasonable sudden Occasion then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
of prying into this dead Body,
which I often sought for, but was still
frustrated in obtaining so usefull a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
through the peevishnesse and
crossenesse of some, and fond foolish
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53574:61"/>
fears of others: And now Mr. <hi>Pick</hi> my
Patient then recovering, a rational per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
easily condescending to my desires,
gave order that his Servant should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
me, who was the only man that
stood by and looked on (while I handled
this horrid object) and can at this day
testifie the verity of several remarques
therein obvious to his eye.</p>

by Fits and Girds, by halves, in a

the Nature and Cure of this abstruse Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
after that I had conversed with the

               </p>
               <p>I shall now deliver to you the Physical
Observations I made, resulting from both
dead, and my own living Body.</p>
               <div n="1" type="observation">
                  <head>Observation I.</head>
                  <p>In the first place, I observe that the
Punctilio's, Pulicar-like Spots, those
Stigmatick marks on the Skin with a
Feaver, do alwayes signifie a stop more
or less put to the Circulation of the
blood, some Coagulation or Grumosity
therein caused, through a malignity, and
Gorgonian Venom that depredates,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53574:64"/>
sacks, and confunds the Vital Spirits
that are the chief instrument of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
so that when they become Torpid
and stupified, part of the blood remains
like standing pool, prone in some short
time to contract an evil odour.</p>
                  <p>Now if this Tartarous concretion be
dissolved, discussed, or thrown out, and
lodged in an Emunctory, or some by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
ignoble, through the strength of
Nature assisted by Art, then all things
succeed well; but if this spissitude of
the blood increase, that the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
are exceedingly clogged, and
nothing is difflated, ventilated, and
carried off by universal breathing sweats,
nor any morbifique matter discharged
into any glandulous or external carnous
diverticle; <hi>conclamatum est,</hi> that person
may be judged in all likelihood to be
lost.</p>

               <div n="2" type="observation">
                  <head>Observation II.</head>
                  <p>Whensoever these Cutaneous spots
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53574:65"/>
appear, they always signify an endeavor
in the Archeus to extrude that which is
noxious: but failing in the very act by
reason of its own impotence, &amp; the force
of the virulent untameable matter car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out of the Capillary vessels, as far
as the skin, it is there condensed by a
preternatural coagulative ferment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
by the ambient air into this round
figure, according as the sperical small
drop is capable. The annitence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to make an expulsion from the
Center to the Circumference may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the Physician to use all means to
imitate her, to assist her, to keep the
blood in continual Motion, to weaken
the strength of the poison to kill an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick
ferment, to rarifie and attenuate
whatsoever is grosse and lentous: and
to keep the Pores open, that there may
be free perspiration of the whole body.</p>

                  <p>When the Natural ferment of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53574:65"/>
Stomack in the Pest is so far lost, that
instead of white, a black juice is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
it is a certain sign of the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the vital Spirit, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of approaching Death. For I never
knew any afflicted in this kinde, whose
strength failed, that vomited an Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
tinged black, did escape: where
this blackness is, there must needs be a
privation of light, with which our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
symbolize, they being luminous,
if so darkness, the shadow of death must
needs follow; and doubtlesse great is
that darknesse that seats it self in the
spirit of light and life.</p>

                  <p>That which did first occurr most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
to my eye in this Dissection,
was the great alteration I found made
principally in the Stomack, in respect
of the part continent and that which
was contained therein: In the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
certain Vibices, Stigms, stroaks,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53574:66"/>
of an obscure colour imprinted; (the
inward coat being stained with colours
different from the natural) and a fluid
matter conteined fuliginous, pitch-like,
did sufficiently indicate to me, that there
the pestilential poyson did take up its
chief residence.</p>

               <div n="5" type="observation">
                  <head>Observation V.</head>
                  <p>When I contemplate what a pure
white substance was taken into this
Youths stomack not long before he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and how strangely it was transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into another hue, as black almost as
Ink, I cannot but smile to think on the
vain Conceits of the <hi>Galenists,</hi> that tell
us of <hi>atra Bilis, adusta, &amp; retorrida,</hi>
black Choller made by a meer torre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
or violent burning heat and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustion,
according to their definition
of a Feaver, as if there were a fire no
whit different from a Culinary in our
Bodyes, converting that which is white
into black, and black into white, by a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53574:66"/>
strong reverberating heat. Suck like
fond and foolish opinions have they har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
these Sixteen hundred years and
upward, for want of the knowledge of
the Doctrine of Ferments; which can
never be so well illustrated, as by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Experiments; which those Pseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Chymists
boast they are acquainted
with (only (I am certain) in a formal
manner sufficient to delude the world,
otherwise they would not deny the
power thereof in their Actions.) If
they did really understand how a little
Leaven doth infect the whole Lump,
they would forthwith leave their bare
beggarly Qualities in curing Diseases,
as Hot, Cold, &amp;c. <hi>(Relollea,</hi> as <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus</hi>
calls them) things transient and
momentany, ebbing and flowing every
minute, according to the disposition of
the Subject, and insist more upon sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
whose intrinsecal transmutation
depends upon powerfull ferments.</p>

                  <head>Observation VI.</head>
                  <p>What a Soveraignty and Influence
the Stomack hath over the whole body
may be proved by multitude of Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Examples that I could produce;
but this was eminently conspicuous, that
when any thing was taken in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
the innate Archeus, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some difficulty to digest, many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Symptoms did strait break forth, as
Vertigo, Cephalalgie, Delicium, Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
Inquietude, Dyspuoea, Sopor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Spirits, a cohibition of
Sweat, and other cutaneous Fxcretions,
&amp;c. This was plainly apparent in this
Stripling, who having an indiscreet
Nurse attending him, suffered much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
when she offered him that which
was by no means to be admitted as tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
the natural ferment of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
being perverted by the pestilent
Poyson: And I doubt not but the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
of his life was accelerated by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witting
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53574:67"/>
Dose of Milk, which though it
be the best Nutriment where it is well
altered, yet it often proves the worse
corrupted.</p>
                  <p>Hereby we may learn not to ingest
any thing into this noble Vessel, but
what may agree with the innate Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
may increase the vital Spirit, rectifie
the enormous Ferment, cherishing that
which is genuine; may be quickly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and leave very little Dross and
Recrement behind, and such are those
things that abound with noble Spirits,
as good Wine, and strong Beer or Ale
well brewed; as for Flesh, Broths, Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
Watergruel, Ptisans, Barley water,
and such like dull vapid things, &amp;c. they
are all to be abandoned and excluded
from entering (into this Palace, where
the sensitive Soul sits) so long as such
a grand Enemy stands in defiance of it,
and seeks to destroy it.</p>

                     </gap>, a great coagulation, and some
small colliquation of juyces, except in
the Stomack, where this Negro liquor
did flote without any Concretion or
Coaction; whereby I gather, That the
kindly and familiar Ferment of the
Stomack, made to dissolve and open
any hard tough food, and to change it
into a fluxible white Chile, that the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive
and excrementitious parts may
be the better separated, being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
and hostile, did still retain a
property like the former, though tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Ruine, tabefying and colliquating
what it touched, and changing it into a
black, instead of a white juyce. On
the other side, the Ferments of the
Fourth and fifth Digestions, ordained
lightly to incrassate, thicken, and to
bring one portion of the blood to a
moderate fibrous consistence, and to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53574:68"/>
subtiliate, another becoming exorbitant,
and losing that primitive gift with
which they were endued, and acquiring
a virulent Nature, transcending their
former bounds of Mediocrity and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
of this red Balsom to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
assimilated, doth now compinge
and closely streighten the part thereof,
depriving it of that continual Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is necessary for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of vital Spirits, the immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of the sense and motion of
every Animal, and turns another small

when vent is given to a large

vessell, for out flies the best as well as

Sanity be wanting, nothing benevalent
can be expected. That Phlebotomy
in the foresaid sense doth cause this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
I can make appear both
Logically and Optically; for the more
good blood, the more good Spirits, and
consequently in Reason all Vital Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
must needs be performed the more
successively, and a stronger expulsion
made of what is offensiue: as on the
contrary, defect of blood and spirits
causes all manner of mischief. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally
also and visibly 'tis true:
For I never saw any deprived of any
great quantity of blood, <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 word">

that Alacrity, stability, celerity, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53574:71"/>
safety, as he that was cured dextrously
<hi>à phlebotomos,</hi> without emission of blood
and spirits. And through this indirect
Course I frequently observe, that those
that are ordered after the <hi>Galenical</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
fall from Acute Diseases into
Chronick, and Tedious Languors,
meerly because their Physicians either
exhaust their Blood, consume their
Spirits by deletery uncorrected Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
torture, crucifie and gaul them
with Blisterings, Cuppings, and Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyings;
Or keep them at a low ebb
with their sluggish, flat and spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Julips and Potions; so that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Archeus becomes weak and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the blood must necessarily move
slowly, and for want of Active Spirits
be retarded in its Current, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places subsist like a standing Pool,
clottering and causing great obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Whosoever therefore that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to keep the blood, <hi>sine Remora,</hi>
fluent in its Channels, free from Curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
let him studie to the utmost to

All this while these Captious Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

though not discrepable and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

In one the imagination of the whole

and can vigorously resist it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
an undaunted resolution; but
the imagination of the <hi>Archeus</hi> may be
weak in the same person, and not able
to make any resistance or renitence,
when it is assaulted by anothers Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
munial ferment, but easily yields
to it. On the other side, the phantasie
of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or vital Spirit of every
part may be couragious and bold, not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53574:78"/>
ready to give way to the Occurse of any
outward evil: yet the imagination of
fear and horrour in the man may be so
great, that upon every slight occasion a
pestilential impression may be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. If the phantasie of man and
the <hi>Archeus</hi> be magnanimous, stout, free
from any Idea, vain conceit of fear and
terrour, having a strong and valiant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
that neither can suffer inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

cannot take place in such a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to offend it, because they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

are in a short time expulsed and
dissipated, before they can settle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to produce any act of hostility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Nature. Now because few have
this ingenite Gift bestowed upon them
so as to be exempted from some pusilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minity
and distrustful thoughts either of
the mind or the <hi>Archeus,</hi> it is very rare
when the Pest is very grassant and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious,
that one coming within the

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53574:78"/>
depart without some stain and spot,
which sometimes is wiped off by
strength of Nature, helped by Art,
without any blemish to the health; and
I am confident many Thousands in this

of the whole body, without the least
cognizance of it. For my own part, I
can avouch by several Signs, being very
curious and exact in the consideration of
my own state, that I often received the
Scent or Tincture of the Pest, but
quickly washed it off by some Balsami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
odour, causing a profluence of a
kindly Sweat. And had I not out of a
little too forward Zeal thrust my hand
without due preparation into the mouth
of this cruel Tyger, I might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
invulnerable to this day; yet
none but an unwitting, mad, self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
person will deny, that the Pest
according to its <hi>Etimon</hi> doth <hi>peredere,

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53574:79"/>
with its sharp fangs; though some clad
like Curassers, with Armour of proof
from Top to Toe, have escaped those
wounds that were inflicted upon others.
One may as well conclude, that the
Itch or Leprosie is not Contagious (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, saith the candid, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Hippocrates;</hi> Time is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,
not without good reason, with
a Sithe in his hand as keen as any Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour;
to signifie to us, that it cuts off
those opportunities, which once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and neglected, can never afterwards
be regained. Therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
an able Physician that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the nick of time, is highly to be
prized by the Patient: Likewise, he
that asketh counsell for prevention, or
sends for an able Chymist, (as for the
<hi>Galenist,</hi> or Pseudo-Chymist, it matters
not much when they are sent for: sith
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53574:81"/>
in Truth (I am sure I can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear)
some of them are to be avoided
as the Pest it self) at the very first on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
of a Disease, is to be attended with
all diligence, and to be supplied with
the best Remedies possible. For my
part I had rather be altogether absent,
than be called upon, when all that I
can do, is to discover to the standers by,
that the Disease is Mortal. What
good can be expected, when Nature is
extream feeble and prostrate, not able
to rise up to make the least conflict with
a forcible Disease, when the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
strength is altogether wanting, 'tis
impossible to make a reparation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dintegration
of that which is abolished,
without a miracle. Of all Diseases,
there is none that finishes its course with
more expedition than the Pest, nor any
insinuates more slily, treads more soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
flatters more subtilly, and kills more
treacherously; the more cautelous
therefore ought we to be how we give
any harbour to it, and through a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53574:82"/>
supinity neglect means fitting to
expell it. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
is an undoubted truth delivered by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi>
He that desires to live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably,
prolong his dayes, and defend
himself from the Pest, and other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
infirmities incident to mankinde,
next to powerfull Medicines, let him
embrace Temperance in his Diet, yet
let him rather drink more, so it be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuos,
than eat; let him rather exceed
in sleeping than watching, in motion
rather than a sedentary course of life,
still discharging any excrementitious
superfluity, chiefly through the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Emunctory, the skin, without any
notable debilitation of the vital spirits:
but above all, let him endeavour after
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, magnanimity,
brave resolution, and an undaunted
firmnesse of minde to resist any vain
conceits of infection. Let the Air,
the principal <hi>vehiculum,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
a nimble conveyer and translater of the
fermental poyson from one to another,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53574:82"/>
be defaecated, purified, and ventilated
from thsoe diversity of effluviums, and
noxious exhalations that conspurcate
its <hi>Magnale,</hi> and fill up the pores there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
with soul corrupt hoary Atoms that
annoy the Archeus. For this purpose
nothing is more efficacious (not only to
segregate <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whatsoever is

<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, any thing malignant
and repugnant to our nature) then
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Sulphur, Brimstone, which may
fitly be so called, both from the giver
of it, and likewise from its Divine ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
The use hereof I have in short
set down in <hi>Loimologia de Elogio Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuris.</hi>
For Sulphurs highly mundifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
made terse and polite, are as it were
<hi>Archei Speculum,</hi> the looking-glasse
wherein the Archeus beholds it self with
delectation and complacency, being
both reflected and illuminated by them;
for whatsoever is luminous and splendid,
doth by an emission of socillating beams
exhilarate and dilate the vital spirits, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53574:83"/>
dispose them to audacity, but that which
is dark, misty, and opacous, doth cloud
them, causing fear and terrour, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers
of this unwelcome guest. For
this reason <hi>Anima Auri,</hi> the clear Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
of Gold, extracted by a friendly
Menstruum, being of a Solar property,
doth wonderfully chear up the vital
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from an implanted congruity, and a
symbolical affinity between each other.
The same is likewise performed by the
defaecated Sulphur of Mars, Antimony,
Vitriol, Blood-stone, native Cinnabar,
without castration of their virtue, which
taken into this Microcosm, do by their
Rutilation and Glistering Rayes, strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fortifie the Spirits against any immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
danger of the Pest, and enable
them to profligate and protrude by
sweat the intoxicating particles gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
within, or taken into us from
without. Whosoever then desires to
possesse these <hi>Arcana's,</hi> must labour
with his own hands, not thinking it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
for him to take pains and toil for
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53574:83"/>
a publick good. It is a most infallible
Truth, That he can never be an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Philosopher, and an able Physitian,
that seeketh not after this Spagyrical
Sophy by his own <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgia,</hi>
Manual Operation must make
him compleat, otherwise he is lame,
maimed and detruncated in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his profession. For I expresly
assert (as I have declared in <hi>Galeno-pale)</hi>
and can prove it, That it is an egregious
shame, and an unsufferable abuse in a
Nation, That a company of Drones
that can do little but make a humming
Noise to please the Ear, should neglect
to gather with their own fingers that
Aetherial, Essential part of every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,
which hath a soveraign vertue to
preserve from, and cure infirmities. He
that desires to attain an insight into
these Mysteries, let him compose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without wavering, to try what
the fire can discover that true Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
light, which <hi>Prometheus,</hi> i.e. eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
prudent circumspect Physitian endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53574:84"/>
to purchase from Heaven, that
he may be able to correct and mitigate
those many calamities that <hi>Epimetheus,
i. e.</hi> an improvident indiscreet man
brings upon himself, ever since that once
divinely gifted <hi>Pandora</hi> offered to him
that Box, which he out of a curiosity
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, opening, brought innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
griess of Body and Mind into the
world: Let him make use of his own
eyes and hands, which are bestowed
upon him for Speculation and Practice.
Let him intuitively examine the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs,
Salts,</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>Animals, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,</hi>
and <hi>Minerals,</hi> in which he shall
finde abscondite most powerfull Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
against the Pest, and other stubborn
Diseases. The saline spirit of Blood,
Bones, and Urine well rectified, are of
admirable use against the Pest; Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the spirit of Harts-horn, (the stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flegm being well separated) doth
powerfully hinder coagulations of the
blood, and sweeten the Acidity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
The Sulphures or oyls of any of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53574:84"/>
these forenamed, well mundefied and
digested with a very clean fixed <hi>Alkali,</hi>
are so united thereto, that they lose their
nauseous unctuousity and become saline,
volatilizing the fixed <hi>Alkali.</hi> I have
often found the spirit of <hi>Tartar</hi> of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
virtue in the Pest; but above all
the pure salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> made volatile by
a combination of its oyl and spirit, and
tinged with the golden Sulphur of some
Minerals, doth effectually resist the
pestilential poyson, cleanse away the
drosse, and any Tartarous tenacious
matter, by Urine, Sweat, expectoration,
exhilarates the Archeus, pacifying the
fury and exorbitance thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> prepared by a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi>
free from corrosion, not with
the common oyl of Vitriol or Brimston,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a very noble Medicine to prevent
Contagion. The legitimate spirit of
Sulphur and Vitriol endued with that
Leptomerie, that there is a manifest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volation
of its parts, gratefull to the
smell, pleasant to the taste, friendly to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53574:85"/>
the Membranes, leaving no evil impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
where it touches, is none of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Remedies; to prevent and Cure
this infection. Spirit of Salt well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flegm'd,
and its much acidity allayed by
a benigne Spirit familiar to our Nature,
is highly to be commended in this case.</p>
               <p>Likewise Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi>
well corrected with Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> is of
Noble efficacy.</p>
               <p>Common Sulphur often sublimed
with bay-salt decrepitated, affords an
admirable Diaphoretick, promoting
the circulation of the blood, as I have
experimentally found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum</hi> (whose
exquisite preparation is neglected by
the <hi>Galenists,</hi> and the approved use
thereof much more unknown to them)
is a Remedy (though ordinary in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of some Chymical elaborate
Medicines) far to be preferred before
all dreggy obtuse Electuaries, Opiates,
and Confactions, as <hi>Mithridat. Theria.
Elect. de Ovo, &amp;c.</hi> I dare avouch that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53574:85"/>
any Physician throughly acquainted
with the due preparation, application,
and appropriation of this innocent thing
(for if it be hurtfull, it is because unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men touch it) may do more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
for his King and Countrey, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Cure of any Endemical Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
then any meer Dogmatist in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Opium</hi> corrected in such a manner,
and menaged with that Method and
Discretion, as that pract cally learned
Dr. <hi>Starkey</hi> hath taught the world,
ought to be highly esteemed for the
quieting and mitigating the rage of the
<hi>Archeus,</hi> and the carrying of Malignity
Diaphoretically.</p>
               <p>The best Oyl of <hi>Amber,</hi> and the pure
salt thereof spiritualized, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus
may the better hold correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with it, strengthens the Stomack,
Womb, all the other membranes and
sinews, seasoning the vital spirits with
such a specifique odour, that they are
not easily affected with a fracide, putrid,
pestiferous scent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:53574:86"/>
Concerning Prevention; I know
not any one thing for Inward use, as a
more sure staff to lean upon, under God,
then the Best Flowers of ♀, quite
bereaved of their vomitive faculty, and
converted into a Diaphoretick and a
little purgative property (where the first
and second Digestions abound with
soul and fluid excrements) without cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising
and robbing them of their
virtue by acide violent corrosives, or
the Torture of the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> sublimed five or six times,
and afterward dissolved in a mild <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,</hi>
gratefull to the smell, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to the taste, wherein the polite
blade of a knife dipped is not denigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or sullied with an obscure colour,
may safely be taken into the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least prejudice, for the dulcify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Latex</hi> become eager, acide, or
austere, the impulse of the blood in its
proper ducts, the prevention of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and for the Protrusion of the
venemous Atoms from the Center to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53574:86"/>
the Circumference, as I have tryed with
constant desired Success.</p>
               <p>Crude <hi>Mercury</hi> well clarified, and
clean Lune without any Alloy, brought
to an Amalgama, powdered, then cast
into coinimon Sulphur, liquified in a
Vessel of <hi>Mars,</hi> and afterward this mass
being often sublimed in a very strong
close body, with a firm head to it, is at
length reduced to a brownish powder,
fixed, of extraordinary effect in all ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditioned
Feavers, causing no distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
at all either by Vomit or Stool,
but by its emicant Blas doth animate
the <hi>Archeus,</hi> to profligate any thing that
is hostile to Nature.</p>
               <p>Whosoever purchaseth some of these
Noble Remedies, need not doubt to
cure, prevent, and so far as Art will
permit, that stubborn, chronick disease,
the Scorbute, which according to my
Judgment in <hi>Loimologia,</hi> hath furthered
and fomented the late Pest. And since
I wrote that little Tract, I have been
much confirmed in my opinion therein,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53574:87"/>
by several Experiments and Instances.
For this reason, all those things that
resist the malignity of the Scurvey, are
approved of use also to prevent this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Sickness. Wherefore in general the
vital strength is to be augmented, the
ambient Air clarified, an adaptation of
mumial Ferments prevented, the <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
of the stomack carefully cherished
and fortified, the blood purified, and
kept freely running in its Pipes, the
Venom mortified, the morbifique Idea
expunged, and the whole body disposed
to a continual Transpiration, by that
means the good God of Nature hath
bountifully provided for us; for this
purpose nothing is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the richly endowed juyce of that
Vegetable (which <hi>Liber</hi> planted to free
poor melancholly man in some measure
from care and sorrow) separated into
various parts by a skilful Analysis of
them, each being exalted, mundified, and
afterwards united again. In this one
Concrete lies hid an infinite Treasury
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53574:87"/>
of Secrets, the true value of which for
sanation of languors, the <hi>Pseudochymists</hi>
do no more understand, than a Dunghil
Cock, the worth of a precious pearl;
if they did, they would never thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
small Beer, Barley water, Posset-drink
made with water and Ale, and
such like poor faint Liquors in such a
case, when the Spirits (without whose
vigour nothing can be done aright) are
subjugated and depauperated by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
Sickness.</p>
               <p>Among Specificks ordained against
the Pest, I find the Viper rightly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
discreetly menaged and applied, to
be deservedly worthy of praise, as the
Experiment on my self, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
taught me. Now the best way
that I always discovered it most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
was to dissolve the flesh by digestion
in a delectable Liquor, conspiring with,
and advancing the Balsamical Alexiteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
virtue thereof, likewise ushering it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
remote parts, that they might be the
better seasoned with its odour, and the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53574:88"/>
terrifying imagination of the <hi>Archeus</hi>
the sooner abolished.</p>
               <p>The more subtile and spiritual part of
Amber, is endued with incomparable
power, both to prevent, and also Cure
the Pest, as I can Practically attest: For
I must needs subscribe (being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
instructed by Fact) to that just
Commendation the profound Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<hi>Van Helmont</hi> gives of Amber:
<hi>Nil sanè</hi> (saith he) <hi>Stomachos, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinis,
Nervis, imo &amp; Cerebro est gratius
Succino in spiritu Vini resoluto:</hi> There
is not any thing that doth more gratifie
the Stomack, Intestines, Sinews, and
Brain, than Amber dissolved in the pure
spirit of Wine.</p>
               <p>Camphire free from Dross, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to pure Spirit of Wine Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
is, as I can judge of it by some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
experience, very beneficial to keep
off and destroy by its eminent odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Crasis, the poysonous odour of the
Pest. Horse-Radish fresh cut into thin
slices, and steeped in White-wine, or
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53574:88"/>
Malago sulphurated in that manner as I
have described in <hi>Loimologia,</hi> is very sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native
of the Scorbute, and a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
against the Pest.</p>
               <p>The proper Urine of him that hath
drank Wine, either taken by it self, or
made into a clear Posset, is without
question an excellent Defensive, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
taken with confidence, for it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuates
the tartarous blood, and carries
it off by Sweat and Urine.</p>
               <p>Juniper, Ivy-berries, Ginger bruised,
and English Saffran steeped in well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
Spirit of Wine, that it may be
impregnated with the virtue of the
foresaid Ingredients, is a powerful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative,
if a Spoonful be taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Morning, Noon and Night with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other spriteful Liquor.</p>
               <p>Some things outwardly applied and
worn are much commended, as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merald
and Saphire and other precious
Stones, which often drawn in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
about a Bubo or Carbuncle placed
directly against the Sun-beams or light,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53574:89"/>
as <hi>(Helmont</hi> advises) do magnetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extract the virulence and malignity
in the body, as is evident by a blackness
arising from those fuliginous cauteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Atoms that exhale.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Periapta,</hi> Amulets, a Verse
out of <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> or any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
Superstitious Words, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
Signatures, Sculptures framed
according to the Conjunction and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
of the heavenly Bodies, Talis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manical
Gamaheus, and such like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
they are by no means to be
trusted to. Neither do I approve of
those appendances of Quick-silver sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate
Auripigment, Arsnick uncorre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
&amp;c. which I have observed are
very uncertain in answering the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of him that hangs them about
his Neck, or applies them to the Pulses
as an Zenexton. I confess (what <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
saith) That the strong Conceit
of the person that uses the foresaid
things, may be of some force to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Infection for a little while, yet the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53574:89"/>
Terrour of the <hi>Archeus</hi> is not taken off,
or so much as mitigated by them; and
all that is hereby performed by them, is,
that there is for some short time a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
exclusion of any notable perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that an evil effect of Contagion
can seize upon the person. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named

a powder quilted in a Bag, or contained
in a spongy Body, continually held at
the Nose; when our <hi>Dogmatists</hi> feel
the Pulse, <hi>aversa facie,</hi> looking West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when their hands point Eastward,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53574:90"/>
as if conscious of their own guilt, they
were ashamed to look their infected Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
in the Face. These are most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
shifts, under which none but
unwitting Physitians will ever shelter
themselves, as <hi>helmont</hi> hath it, <hi>Quasi
venenum desineret esse, Aromate satu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum!

i.e. as if that lost its poysonous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
that had good store of Spices
mixt with it, and was not rather convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
farther into all parts by the conduct
a grateful odour! as if Spices were not
liable to be infected! as if Arsnick or
Woolfsbane copulated with Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greese,
gave over their hurtful Nature!
as if the most fragrant Wine was not in
an instant polluted by a musty Vessel!
These are <hi>Naeniae,</hi> pitiful things to put
any confidence in. A true Zenexton,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53574:90"/>
or outward preservative is quite of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nature (as the Philosopher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides
it) for it depends not upon the
meer phantasie excited, or unmoveable
belief of the person; but its ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
is laid in Nature, which hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon it this active gift to do so
and so. A true Zenexton, according to
<hi>Helmont,</hi> ought to be no way capable of
Infection, if any expect it should keep
him from the same. And here we may
take Notice that mans Pest differs from
Brutes, so that theirs is not mortally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
to us, nor ours to them, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the disproportion of mumial fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that is between each; however
their skins or flesh may be so contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by our pestiferous Emanations,
that they may be a means to convey it
from one man to another.</p>
               <p>Our Noble Chymical Philosopher
doth very much commend Amber for a
Zenexton or Preservative, from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
and experience of <hi>Gordiola</hi> a
Spanish Chyrurgion, Master of the Pest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53574:91"/>
at <hi>Ostend,</hi> who, as he relates, was
preserved the space of Three years, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Plague there, by means of a
piece of Red Amber his Zenexton,
which he chafed, till it grew warm upon
the seven principal Pulses; to wit, the
Temples, the Wrists, the Ankles, and
Left Pap (I wonder he omitted the
strongest beating Pulses in the Groin)
he, as <hi>Helmont</hi> was an Eye-witness, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
continued in health, when the
rest of his Mates miscarried; and the
same Author backs this experimental
Effect with prevalent Reasons, taken
first from its powerful attractive force
manifested and stirred up by Frication,
next from its first Transparency, Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity,
Porosity, and Rarity of parts,
which make it more susceptible of our
warmth and mumial odor; lastly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from
the universality of its Traction, being
not limited as the Loadstone to Iron,
but generally drawing any thing, so it be
light and tractable, whereupon he infers,
It may abundantly be able to draw the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53574:91"/>
pestilent virulent Air to it, sith it attracts
light things, especially when it shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
an appropriation and adaptation
by a mumial ferment. Questionless most
admirable is the radiant influence of
precious Stones, and other translucent
scintillating bodies (rightly applied)
upon our Spirits, even like the Stars of
Heaven: wherefore it ought not to
seem strange, if such a shining Concrete
as Amber, have such an extraordinary
gift of preserving from the Pest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon it, by <gap reason="foreign">

Signature impressed upon it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
what a dotal excellency is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in it against a Disease that is often
conspersed with variety of Spots.</p>
               <p>The great difficulty to bring this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
to a true Zenexton, lies in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
preparation of it, the manner
whereof, that great Investigator of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>Van Helmont,</hi> hath thus delivered,
as he received instructions from <hi>Butler</hi>
an Irish man, who (to <hi>Helmonts</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
had Cured some Thousands of
the Pest at <hi>London.</hi> He gave directions
that a large <hi>Bufo</hi> taken in the Afternoon
in the Month of <hi>Iune,</hi> should be hung
up by the Legs nigh the fire over a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of yellow Wax made into the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Dish or Platter: After three
dayes that the <hi>Bufo</hi> had hung in this
manner, it vomited up a terrene matter,
and certain Insects; Flies of a greenish
colour, with wings shining like gold,
then the <hi>Bufo</hi> forthwith dyed. This
<hi>Butler</hi> told our Philosopher, That a
<hi>Bufo</hi> ordered aright, was a sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53574:92"/>
for Forty thousand persons. But
unhappily the right knack of this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was not yet fully discovered to <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
which he promised he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
had he not been suddenly banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and sent packing away. However,
perspicacious <hi>Helmont</hi> proceeded thus
with great success; he took the cadave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Bufo</hi> dried and beaten in to powder
with that filth it had vomited, and so
made it up into Trochisks with Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth,
which he used with good event
both for precaution and sanation of the
Pest. After this he made a further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
thus; he got in the Month of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
(the Moon decreasing) a <hi>Bufo,</hi> the
oldest he could find, whose eyes stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out, were full of white Worms
with black heads, insomuch that both
the inward parts of the eyes were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into Worms closely joined together
in each corner, their heads appearing
outward; and if any attempted to get
away, the <hi>Bufo</hi> presently suppressed it
with its Paw. These he disposed and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53574:93"/>
menaged in the same manner as is set
down before, and found them a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Zenexton. <hi>Gestati autem
Trochisci,</hi> saith he, <hi>ad mammam sinistram
arcebant contagium &amp; loco infecto alliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
statim virus extrahebant.</hi> Trochisks
made of a <hi>Bufo</hi> thus prepared, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the left Pap, kept away Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and fastened to any place infected,
did immediately extract the Poyson;
moreover, that which is remarkable,
<hi>Erant Trochisci promptiores &amp; validiores
si in usum aliquoties recidissent quam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiores:</hi>
The oftner they were used,
the more speedily and powerfully did
they perform their business, beyond
those that were fresh, and never used.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Adepti</hi> gives this Philosophical
reason of the rare operation of the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo</hi>
in this kind; for being a Creature
naturally very timorous, that bears a
perfect hatred against man, and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the same by an extraordinary fear
it conceives at the presence of man;
when it dyes, the whole body is seasoned
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53574:93"/>
and distained with such an Idea of Fear,
that even the Cadaver retains the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
thereof after Death. <hi>Qui ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
ab homine,</hi> saith <hi>Helmont, naturalem
energiam sibi acquirit &amp; imprimit, contra
imagines territi Archei in homine; siqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
terror Bufonis interimit &amp; annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat
Ideas territi Archei humani:</hi> This
terrour in the <hi>Bufo</hi> arising from the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of man, acquires an Energy against
the imagination of the terrour of the
<hi>Archeus;</hi> that which is natural, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
this which is accidental: And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as no Poyson exerts its violent
power without the ferment of mans
Mumie (which being different from a
Brutes, is the reason that our Pest doth
not annoy them) neither can the Pest
infect any, unless there be a symbolical
Congruity and Participation of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
wherefore it is the nature of this
Zenexton to hinder the mumial Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from receiving and appropriating
the pestilent Poyson to it self, and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbs
it, that it cannot roost in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53574:94"/>
Subject, or be fitted to it.
Hence it falls out, that that venemous
Idea of Hatred and Terror in the <hi>Bufo,</hi>
annihilates the image of the pestilent
Poyson in the <hi>Archeus,</hi> which strait is
corroborated, perceiving not only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
of the virulent Idea, but also
finding an appropinquation of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more desponding and timorous
than it self; for it is observed that the
<hi>Bufo</hi> is a Creature so extreamly fearful,
that if you take the advantage to look
upon it with a firmly fixed intentive eye
for a quarter of an hour, there being no
avoidance of your countenance, it will
shortly dye with very terrour, as I have
tryed. Thus mans <hi>Archeus</hi> beholds as
it were in a Glass, the picture of the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo</hi>'s
pusillanimity, with a delectable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
by means of this applicated Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexton,
which by Divine institution
procures his Sanity.</p>
               <p>Divers good Topical Remedies may
be made use of with good success, as
Water-cresses, Garden-cresses, Bank-cresses,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53574:94"/>
Horse-Radish, Dittander, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus,
Aconitum, Figgs stamped and
boiled in Vinegar, which applied to Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo's

               <p>That which I have found most lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
and of approved experience in
Botches and Carbuncles, is a Plaister
made of the Balsom of <hi>Antimony,</hi> of
the Balsom of Brimstone, <hi>Bals. Fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>

have been vented abroad against

some subtill slie Wits made use of to

Now how far this is from Candour and
Integrity, let any impartial man judge.
If I have spoken, writ, or done any thing
amisse in Physick, I am forthwith rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to clear my self; if I do not, let me
suffer any condign punishment. The
principal Design of the <hi>Galenists,</hi> is to
weaken the sinews of Truth, by scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalously
and falsly disparaging my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
calling me Fanatick, one of an

(as my friends can testifie) been Loyal
to my Soveraign. They whisper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
my back, that I am no Schollar;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53574:96"/>
because that I have not spent my time

<hi>Quidlibets,</hi> and <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> such as
study <hi>Cicero</hi> to confute <hi>Helmont;</hi> who
stand more upon a word mis-placed, a
<hi>Grammatical Errour,</hi> than upon the
Loss of <hi>a Mans Life.</hi> If any of these
false Impeachers dare appear to my
face, I should easily make it out, that
the <hi>Galenists</hi> are a company of grand
talkative Impostors, Ignorant in the
main thing that belongs to their Art,
the radical Cure of Diseases, and this I
will maintain, expressing my self in
congruous <hi>Latine, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew
Terms,</hi> not as a Parrot or Daw, that
hath only learnt <hi>Verba, praeterea nihil;</hi>
but intellectually, fruitfully, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Mankind. As for their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to vilifie my Reputation, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the World believe, that I was
at first a Practitioner in Chirurgery,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53574:96"/>
before I applied my self to Physick (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
an untruth) yet it conduces
much to my Credit, though otherwise
intended by them: For let me tell these
men, that are little else but smooth O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
Polyglossi, multiloquous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
that if they were but truly <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgi,</hi>
Operators with their own hands,
they would have attained ere this a
farre greater excellency in that Art, in
which I am sure they are extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
to their remarkable shame.
Withall I would have my Enemies
know, that I was so well-grounded,
principled, and had acquired such The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orems
in the Profession of Physick
before I entered upon the Practical
part, that I was able to give a fair Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Account of that fraudulent way,
improperly called Methodical, as well
(I suppose) as the best of them: Yea
directly aiming at this and no other
Faculty, I made all Inquisition possible,
that I might be throughly instructed,
before I entred upon Medicinal Action;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53574:97"/>
and for that end, after long Study, I
sought for, and by good Providence
found out a faithfull Friend, at first an
Apothecary, <hi>omnibus suis numeris &amp;
partibus expletus,</hi> every way accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in his faculty, afterward an expert
knowing Physician, one that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
maliciously and wrongfully, to
his overthrow, by the Dogmatists, for
preparing <hi>Lac Sulphuris,</hi> an innocent
usefull Chymical Medicine; for which
Act doubtlesse divine <hi>Nemesis</hi> will at
length bring them to shame. This
Gentleman conducting me to his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and informing me concerning se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
remarkable things in Physick:
gave me much light both in <hi>Galenical</hi>
and <hi>Spagyrical</hi> Practice; the last where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
according as I could judge then, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Twenty years past, seemed to be
most effectual: yet unwilling to forsake
the old beaten Road of the Antients, I
did not presently subscribe rashly to
that, to which I was forced afterwards
by degrees to grant <hi>ipso facto</hi> to be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53574:97"/>
Truth, much inconsistent at that time
with my Profit. Then desiring to do

               </gap>,
decently, and in order, I purchased a

if they have been of so long

not a rush whether they be <hi>Literatores

            <p>Thus much for the wiping off those
Aspersions that they have wrongfully
cast upon my own Person, Next, I shall
answer in short to some things thrown
in my Teeth, and often charged upon
me in reference to others, and the noble
Spagyrick Science.</p>
            <p>They upbraid me, That I frequently
meet and join with an illiterate Rabble,
Gunsmiths, Heel-makers and Botchers,
that Rail against the Universities, and
all Learning in general. This I confess
ingenuously is the worst they can say of
me: That once I did for a time associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
my self (for the Promotion of that
useful Chymical Art, some Learned
Chymists, as Dr. <hi>Dey,</hi> Dr. <hi>Manwaring,</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:53574:98"/>
&amp;c. true Disciples of <hi>Helmont,</hi> being

Unexperimented Pretenders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
who, not invited, but intruded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
impudently among us: But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
in a short space my self defiled
by their Heady, High-minded, Rude
Boasting, Insolent, Preposterous Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
I strait withdrew, and washed my
hands of such Dirty Companions: And
when ever after it was my Chance to
come into any of their Company sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I sharply Reproved them for their
bitter Invectives against Learning.
When a Pragmatical Stickler not long
ago did speak in Contempt of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
asserting, <hi>That a man might be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Chymist, without the Languages;</hi> I
replied, <hi>That the same Person would be
far better, had he been qualified with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature
as he ought.</hi> So much Respect
have I for some Professors of Physick,
though great Oppugners of true Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry,
yet otherwise very well endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That did they not abuse the Gift of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53574:99"/>
Tongues, to maintain the Idleness of
their Hands, that pernicious course of
Bleeding, colliquating uncorrected Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives;
did they not defend too obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
(against all demonstrative Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction)
fruitless, feculent, dull, nastie
Medicaments, Blisterings, Issues, Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
and Scarifications, &amp;c. And did
not mans Life stand in Competition
with these Tenents, I should Honour,
Reverence, and Admire them above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But as they have ordered the
Matter, I may in Verity affirm, That it
had been happier that they had never
known how to have worded it so well,
unless they had been more skilful to
have worked better for the Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Cure of Mankind; for so far as
I can understand, their knowledge of
words, which ought to be an Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the right understanding of
things, is become a <hi>Remora,</hi> a Pull-back
to themselves, that they cannot make
an effectual progress in what is most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
Scientifick in Physick, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53574:99"/>
withall, not a little scandalous to others,
who have harboured but mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of Verbal Notions, seeing so few
salutary Actions proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
            <p>I confesse I am not a little ashamed,
when I hear of, and am twitted with the
great abuses in Chymistry, committed
by some of those, who have been
thought stout defenders of the same.
When I am told of an illiterate, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
fellow, a very shame to the Art,
that is in fee with Midwifes, Nurses,
Busie, prating, wandering women, that
cry him up for a brave Doctor, who
cannot, as the Proverb is, <hi>say Boh
to a Goose;</hi> being neither truly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

When, I say, this is objected to
me, as undeniable, I cannot but break
forth into indignation, that such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Science should be thus polluted, by
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53574:100"/>
every profane Idiot. When a sad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
comes to my ear, at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
without further doubt, that an
upstart Chymist, taking upon him to
be a Champion of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and writing
a copious Tract for the defence of this
way, (containing much Truth) should
take into his hand a Patient, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Quality, enjoying his Health at
that time (according to his Friends te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
better than he had a long
space before) should sequester him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a by-corner, mure him up in a <hi>Quacks</hi>
House, separate him from his entire
Friends, should for prevention of the
Gout, without the least Tincture (as
some knowing Physicians affirm) of
the <hi>Venereal Lues,</hi> salivate him, (or, as
that Gang hath found a new Term,
Nod him) to the one and twentieth
day with <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
(a Medicine unworthy to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by a free-born Son of Art, if he
knew better) and that against his own
Judgement, led, as he pretends, by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53574:100"/>
the Importunity of his Patient into this
course: that he should after the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of prepared Pearl (whether <hi>Galeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
or <hi>Chymical</hi> they best know) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
a Diet-Drink on the 17th day,
and then afterward slop him with syrrup
of Violets, Rose-water, and Milk, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
with spotted Lungwort, Colts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,
Sage, Wood-sorrell, Plantain,
Succory, (O Brave Chymist! I am
perswaded he will write ere long for the
<hi>Galenists)</hi> and then in the Conclusion
to suffer this distressed Gentleman, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the 24th day, to be concealed
9. dayes after his death, from his dear
Brothers, (without admission of other
advice) who at length inquiring of his
Physician for his Corps, was denyed
by him the discovery thereof; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at length with much ado found it
out, summoned the Physician and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
together, that the Body (preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be embalmed, but otherwise ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
upon the inspection) might fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be opened for their own satisfaction,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53574:101"/>
and the acquittance of those that were
about him: which reasonable desire
was denyed by the Physician, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
prevented by him; That this
supposed Chymist should (to excuse
this foul Businesse,) afterward impeach
an Honest laborious Chymist (who had
given Physick to this person the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Pseudo-Chymist his Patient two
years before, and not since) that he
had a hand in this Gentlemans Death.
Whereas I heard it attested by one of
Credit, that there was a gratefull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of the Patient at that
time both by word and deed, that he
had received very great Benefit by
the foresaid falsely accused Physician.
When, I say such an ugly Story comes
to my ear, often repeated to me as one
concerned, by persons of Credit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Brothers of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
deceased, men of Integrity and
Good Report, who had most of what I
deliver here from the Pseudo Chymists
own Mouth; when being upbraided, I
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53574:101"/>
am made sensible how this Base filthy
Action (not to be excused by any, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
one of a superlative Impudence)
reflects upon the Chymical Profession,
and the Honest Able Professors of this
Illustrious Art, to the diminution of its
repute among, those that have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
a clear understanding in these
things, I cannot conceive otherwise,
but some evil Spirit of Darknesse is
changed into an Angel of Light, and
and is become on a sudden a <hi>Galeno-Chymist,</hi>
a <hi>Pseudo-Chymist,</hi> a meer <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go-Chymist,</hi>
and a <hi>Plano Chymist,</hi> on
purpose to bring an infamy upon Truth,
to delude the world, and to frustrate it
of that happinesse it might enjoy by
Pious, Honest, Modest, Learned, or
Lovers of Learning truly expert labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Spagyrists. But enough of this: I
shall leave this <hi>Antesignanus</hi> of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Deformity, with some of his
Complices, to be further examined by
Justice, that there may be a full discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this foul oblique Business.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:53574:102"/>
I shall return once more to the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
at whose doors most of these grand
Mischiefs in Physick may justly be laid.
'Tis through their Idleness, Pride, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
Negligence, Ignorance, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious
Insufficiency in their Art, that
such disguised Stentors in Chymistry,
such scandalous Persons, <hi>Omnium hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
homunciones, Nebulones, viles Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae,
Idiotae, Fungi merum pocus;</hi> such as
will sell a mans life, rush into this Divine
Art, and prostitute their Souls for Gain!</p>
            <p>I say, the Dogmatists are exceeding
Culpable herein, that might in due time
have prevented most of these <hi>Iatrical</hi>
Calamities; for had they followed their
Function as they ought, Candidly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously,
and Laboriously, these
things had never been. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this, they still persevere in their
indirect way, as obstinate as any Jew;
whereas if they would (laying aside
their present secular Interest) be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
to submit to Chymical Truth,
and that no farther than I, with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53574:102"/>
are able to demonstrate visibly
the certainty thereof. These Meteors
in Chymistry, these inflated Bubbles
would come to Nothing.</p>
            <p>But instead of this Candor and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
they still stand upon the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of their Mortiferous Principles;
for that end, one of that Fraternity, Mr.
<hi>N. H.</hi> hath divulged a Sophistical Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
for Vindication and Assertion of
<hi>Galenical</hi> Opinions. Some little curso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
View I chanced to have of it, enough
to satisfie me what this Juggler and his
Assistants aim at. In his <hi>Epistle,</hi> I took
Notice how he importunes his <hi>Grace</hi> to
promote the speedy enacting of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Lawes, whereby Illegal Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
may be restrained and punished. I
wish with all my soul that this Mr. <hi>N. H.</hi>
might have his request: supposed he
and his Fellows might likewise be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to undergo a Chymical Trial, that
their foul D<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>osse in Physick might be
discovered, and their Cut-throat Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the Small Pox, and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53574:103"/>
Feavers, to the Losse of the
Life of some Heroes, might be made
apparent; then I am certain They, as
illegal Practisers, would be the first that
the Law would lay hold on to restrain
and punish, according to their Demerits.</p>
            <p>To conclude, had leisure been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to have strictly perused Mr. <hi>N. H.</hi>
his Garrulous <hi>Tract,</hi> (contrived by one
of his Sophistical wily Brethren, lying
couched in time of the Pest, and garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with many polite, trimm words,
and back'd by specious Authority of
Writers, but mis-applyed, mis-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
<hi>nihil ad Rhombum,</hi> nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the main thing, which every
Honest Able Physician is bound to take
in hand, <hi>i. e.</hi> to cure Man as he ought.)
I should, perhaps, have given some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to his egregious Folly; but it is
enough that I have challenged this
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>Galeno-proclosis,</hi> to make
it appear that he is grosly Ignorant in
the Fundamental Cure of any Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Feaver. And once more I propose
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53574:103"/>
to him this undeniably equal determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of our Controversies by Fact,
that he would vouchsafe to meet me in
any Hospital, with competent Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
agreed upon by us both; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they shall Judge of our
Actions, so let them proclaim us to the
World. If he deny to accept of this,
I am resolved to publish him, no other
than a meer sounding peece of Vacuity.</p>
