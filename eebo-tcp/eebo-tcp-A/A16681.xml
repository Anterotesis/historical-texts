            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He hath an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy with the Cocke, especially of the Game. One reason is, because he sees him commonly with his Crowne on his head, while Princes commonly are iealous of each other. Some say because he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes to come into his presence booted &amp; spur'd, contrary to the Law in Court.

He is so hot of Nature that he is never without a burning feaver, but is faine to recover himselfe; for in his raging fits, no one of his Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans dares approach to feele his pulse.

It is the innocencie of his gentle breast, that makes his heart so light, and the bodie so naturally actiue. He keepes Holiday euerie day, and is neuer without his pumps on, to be readie to dance. For he will daunce you beyond measure, and yet be neuer out of his dance. He is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie desperate in his tricks, so that if he chance to fall, he ventures his necke, life, and all. He is no Carpet-knight
<pb facs="tcp:6450:7"/>
that danceth on strewed tapestries, for he will daunce upon a tree without any musicke, But this in the Forrest onely, for in the Citie he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner with him, where it is ridiculous to daunce without musicke, and therefore gets him a dauncing schoole with a chime of little Bels at least. He is a foure-footed bird that is kept in a cage, not to sing, for hee hath no voice that is worth the hearing, but to dance one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. One would wonder to see him so well breathed who will hold out so long and yet not be tyred, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

considering the diet he uses being commonly nuts, so apt with us to breed obstructions, and the tisicke. With an apple and a nut or two hee will make himselfe not onely an handsome collation but a royall feast. It is verie strange what teeth the thiefe hath, for he wil pare you a wallnut as bigge as his head, much sooner than we an apple, yea and devoure the kernell and all ere you would imagine. He hath a good face, and he knowes it well, &amp; some beautie withall, whereof he is exceeding choice and tender, while hee never
<pb facs="tcp:6450:8"/>
goes especially in the Sun, but he carries his <hi>Vmbrella</hi> about him, which serves him likewise for a cloake in a showre of raine. Hee that should marke him well, would thinke him a puppet made in fashion of a Squiril, that by engines were made so to mount up and downe, and that either he had no ioynt at all, or all were nothing else but ioynts, for he moves not his head so much as his whole bodie when hee moves. Hee is very neat, for hee washes his face at every bit he eats, &amp; should be a Iew in that, but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things hath no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb facs="tcp:6450:9"/>
in him at all. In a word, I told him to have a good nature with him, and a pretty wit, &amp; though hee seeme to have a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning head, yet stayed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchments.</p>

He is a

Schoolemaster right, who is never without a sharpe rod in his hand, and his Schollars are certaine blacke boyes that board in his house. He is as good as a Sergeant at Mace, for if he catch a debter by the cloake as he goes along, he would make him beleeve he were arrested, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king backe to bee readie to aske at whose suite. Howsoever hee is a right Catch pole, that will go neare to catch one by the pole indeed. He is no swearer, but will rend and teare like an arrant Turk. In fine, being of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of the Bushes, he is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

<pb facs="tcp:6450:11"/>
upon his head, to make him seeme much higher then he is. His coat is faire and beautifull, powdered here and there with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine spots which make a handsome shew, and were it not his owne, would be thought a rich weare, and little inferiour to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin furrs or the Ermins of Russia. He hath long and slender legges, like a Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shanke, or Irish Kern, which makes him so tall a footman as he is. He hath foure of them, or else it were impossible so great a bulke could be held up by so weake pillars. Hee flies like a Parthian Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb facs="tcp:6450:12"/>
with his face turned backwards, not to shoote his enemies, but to shew them a faire paire of heels. Before he fights he whets his horne, as a Mower doth his Sithe, but uses them rather as a Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forke in harvest to tosse the hounds with, like hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks in the Meadowes. Hee is much delighted with Musicke, I may say much taken with it, for he is often caught of the Hunters by that meanes; As the Horse by his teeth is knowne how old he is, if the marke be not out of his mouth; so hee by his hornes, if he have not cast
<pb facs="tcp:6450:12"/>
them in some bush. The Heralds call his hornes his <hi>Thiara</hi> or dresse, and say hee is not fully attired till he have them absolute and compleate: this I am sure of, that when they have them not on, they are ashamed, and hide themselves, as Maids that are unreadie. Hence it is perhaps that tyers and hornes are held Synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas. Hee is very constant in his fashion, for he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges his attire but once a yeare, and then never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

paine is rather had how to take him. When he is hunted by a Prince, he is ever after termed a Hart. In fine, had he but valour to his strength, and not such wings at his feet, I see not why but for his goodly head hee might make a noble Standard in our Wildernesse.</p>

Nature it seems hath layd him out of sight in the bowels of the earth for feare of killing with his lookes. It is either the Sulphure it selfe or the boyling froth of Hell, and eternall flames, it is the selfe same colour, and the cause of so many damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions.

think they would have it respirable, which they do pretty well, when they can breathe and speake of nothing else. He is the <hi>Orpheus</hi> who with his lookes only, without set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his hand to the Lyre, enchants and ravishes the most savadge of our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse.

a <hi>Iupiter,</hi> because joviall. Hee is capable but of two sinnes, Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Levity, which in him are held for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. He loves not to bee cut or barbed, nor wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his trimming, for thereby he loses much of credit and estimation with men. Hee is very charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for he will waste and spend himselfe and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to make a sick man well, or to comfort his heart. He hath no good voyce, but a kinde of hoarsenesse with him, which yet is twenty times more gracefull than the best musick the silver

Hee is a great enemy to the winds, principally the North and South; and therefore having but two gates to the City where he keepes his hold, hee hath barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes for them both to shut them out. There are two sorts of them, one for land, who never put to sea, the other seafaring men, that never come to land: who as they differ
<pb facs="tcp:6450:16"/>
in trade of life, so do their manners: yet both are weather wise alike, and both crafty enough it seemes to provide for themselves. For if the one have his fort, the other his ship to trust to: and if the one keepe out the wind at his doores, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a storme will stick to his tackling, and take in stones for his Ballice, or if need bee, cleave to an anchor; and therefore should be politick as they all likely are, who are so. Hee is all comb, though not to kemb with, which hath no teeth but to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe with, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:6450:17"/>
is no friend from the teeth outward, while eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tooth is a very sting. He is but a milksop yet, and a very suckling, who will hang on the speens of every Cow, which therefore makes him cry so like a child. He cannot brag much of his gentry, whose father was a Boare, his mother a Sow, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a Pigge, and all begot under a hedge. If there bee any such place as <hi>Hoggs Norton</hi> is, where Piggs play on the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, it is surely with them; who have such a squeeking cry with their wind instruments. What

his flesh is to eat, I know not, but I should think, hee that should eat him whole, were as good have a burre in his throat. They say his flesh is as good and as tender as a Rabbet, but this I am sure, their furre is nothing neere so gentle. As the Fox hath his hole, so hath he his bush, from whence there is no getting him forth, till he be fired out. Hee is no great medler himselfe, nor loves to bee medled with, nor any that is wise, I think, will teyze with him, who knowes how touchy hee is. For my part, if I stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

He is called the Wolfe of the water, but is indeed a monster of nature; for the Wolfe spares his kinde, but hee will devoure his owne nephewes ere they come to full growth.

Hee is so unweildy and stiffe in all his joynts, as he never moves but in Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and then rocks like himselfe. It is the pallace of the king of beasts, where hee keepes
<pb facs="tcp:6450:20"/>
his Court, well founded, walled, and vaulted over with a stony roofe; no windowes there, but the open doores or mouth thereof, unlesse you will say the eyes of every creature there, are the glasse windowes, which being within, doe serve them well enough to see with. He is even as old as the world, and hath seene many centuries of yeeres to passe over his head. Hee could speake perhaps of the Deluge of <hi>Noah,</hi> as it had been but yesterday, were hee well put to it. This I can tell you, that being so long

There is no Tortoyse could beare so great a load, yea, if the whole world were laid on his back, he would not shrink an inch under it, unlesse the foundation or center should faile. It is well that God and nature hath made him inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, for were he sensible as the beasts of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests are, and should but walk therein, hee would shoulder every thing out of his place.

growes all beneath his chinne; whereof hee is so proud, that if you take him by it, they all take it for a common affront to the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious familie of the <hi>Goats,</hi> and wil either hang downe the head, or make it a quarrell.

euer ready to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the same to others, especially if they approach unto him, and bee but conversant and familiar with him: it being not possible for one to keepe him company for any time, and not enflamed, though of iron, or harder hearted than a very stone. He is a right Salamander that lives in the fire, but yet for want of fresh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, will even die in the fire it selfe, and, as all things else, at last bee brought to ashes. The truth is, hee is not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster cooke, but a scullion, and therefore meddles no
<pb facs="tcp:6450:32"/>
higher than with making the fire only. He is fitter indeed for the Kitchin than the Parlour, for his ill complexion he gives to others; especially Ladyes, and the finer sort, who therefore casheere him thence, and shut him out for a rude companion. Hee is but of meane and base condition, and hath his extraction from the earth only, both by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, whereas Seignior Charcoale is of a better descent, and comes perhaps from the loynes of stately Ash, Oak, or Beech. Hee is good to approach to, but
<pb facs="tcp:6450:33"/>
not too neere, for so hee will anger you, and put you into a heat, but if you keepe your distance with him, hee is a very good companion in the winter. And to tell you truth, hee is a good plaine fellow, and an honest Blacksmith, and in the forge will take his liquor as well as his master, if hee take not too much.</p>

Hee is a true savage, who hath no more civility with him than that place can afford him: By his gate you wold take him to bee a right cripple, who goes on his hands, while his forefeet are much shorter than his hinder. Hee is no witch though hee border upon Lapland, and bee tied to a stake, for hee burnes not there, though he bee hot, and put into a chafe by the Mastive dogs. He is pestilence kind where hee takes, for if hee chance to
<pb facs="tcp:6450:34"/>
catch a dog in his armes, hee so hugges him, as hee will even breake his back withall. Hee is very lico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, which makes him love hony so much, that costs him many a scratcht face by those peevish Elfs who have the keeping of it; but he cares not, so he may lick his lips after it.

But I should take them for pawes rather, which will
<pb facs="tcp:6450:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make you pause ere you get out of them. If he be a man of warre, he is a tall one, for hee fights high, and is nothing snugge as the Bull is, who fights so low; but high or low, when he fights, he will be sure to roare full loud with his cannon voyce, if hee bee put to it. Hee is very unthrum at every thing he goes about, and brings his work but rawly forth, till with the fyling of the tongue with much adoe, he brings them at last to some perfection. He is a good Trencherman, for hee will eat soundly at an other mans cost. But if he
<pb facs="tcp:6450:35"/>
be at his own finding, hee will dine you sometimes with Duke <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and keepe his chamber like one with never a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in his purse. They have their Seniors with them, it should seem, who have their Majorities and Minorities amongst them: but fall not out about pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence, because in the heavens there is no strife at all; the truth is, hee would make at least a good Groome in the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Court, especially the Porter there, for his grim looke and the habit hee weares.</p>

If he be of the right stamp, and a true Tewxbury man, he is a cholericke gentleman, and will beare no coales; but will himselfe strike any man into a heat that takes him into his roofe; though indeed he will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily bee pacified againe with a crust of bread, and so long I hold him to bee no such perillous Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

he weares so curld, much after the womens fashions now adayes, this I am sure of, howsoever it becomes them: It sets forth our Gennet well, his legges, he borrowed of the Hart with his swiftnesse, which makes him a true courser indeed. The Starres in his forehead hee fetcht from heaven, which will not be much mist, there being so many. The little head he hath, broad breast, fat but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocke, and thicke tayle, are properly his owne; for he knew not where to get him better. If you tell him of the hornes he wants to make him most compleat,
<pb facs="tcp:6450:42"/>
he scornes the motion, and sets them at his heele. He is well shod especially in the upper leather, for as for his soles, they are much at reparation, and often faine to be removed. Nature seemes to have spent an Apprentiship of yeares to make you such a one, for it is full seven yeares ere hee comes to this perfection, and be fit for the Sadle: for then (as we) he seemes to come to the yeares of discretion, when he will shew a kinde of rationall judgement with him, and if you set an expert Rider on his backe, you shall see how
<pb facs="tcp:6450:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>

This will our <hi>Bucephalus</hi> do in the lists. But when hee comes abroad into the
<pb facs="tcp:6450:43"/>
fields hee will play the countrey Gentleman as truly as before the Knight in Turnament. If the game be up once, and the hounds in chase, you shall see how he will pricke up his eares streight, &amp; tickle at the sport as much as his Rider shall, and laugh so loud, that if there be many of them, they will even drowne the rurall harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the dogges. When he travels, of all Innes he loves best the signe of the silver bell, because likely there he fares best, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if hee come the first, and get the prize.

seldome ever lets them fall till they be cropt off, and after that as in despight will never weare them more.

do weare the breeches, the Males having yeelded up the right of superiority to them, as being the true Amazons of that species. They are chast and loyall enough to their mates, nor will easily stain the marriage bed; but the male is fain to play the cocquain at home to look to the house, while the goodwife her selfe will go to the market to seeke provision, or hunt for the purpose. They go in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall habits, some with long sleeves, they call wings, other shorter, and so are stiled short or long wing'd Hawes, according
<pb facs="tcp:6450:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to their habits, but so, as constant ever in the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they once take up. They have excellent Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors when need is to mend their cloathes, who will put you peeces so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly in, that they shall not be perceived. Hoods are a great fashion with them, which terme they keepe common with us; but for their bootes, they call them Gesses, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them from ours. They are very forgetfull, for being tied so fast by the heeles, they never think of it, but will offer to fly away an hundred times an houre. She hath
<pb facs="tcp:6450:46"/>
so curious a pallat of her owne, as she will not trust any cooke to dresse her fowle for her, but will plume and pick it her selfe with an admirable dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. If she bee high with too much ease, and grow pursie, shee will physick her selfe, and take a vomit, and thereby come as sound as a Bell.

with many that go with chaines about their necks, by two and two, which they call couples, where they doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but serve her, and put up her game; yea, the best man in the company will not refuse to toyle and sweat to shew her sport, and of all they take, she is first serv'd. They are somewhat fantasticall, and as their manner is, will take a toy now and then, and go strait beyond seas without a licence, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king leaue of their friends ere they go, where when they come, or returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they are held as

they have no Treble amongst them, but all trouble and confusion. When they go into the warres among themselves, they keepe no discipline at all, nor march all their troopes in files, but pelmel rush in one upon another, and every one sounds his owne Trumpet. When he sings he would make you beleeve he runs division, being no more then a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bodie, through a foolish tricke hee hath got, to dance when hee sings, or to sing when he dances.

<pb facs="tcp:6450:54"/>
of many burrowes, which meeting together with Streets and Lanes, make up a goodly Citie of his owne, which is not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, because the Citizens there go all bare-foot. He is a good Ferrier under ground, but bolts no Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets out, because they are Countrey men, and haile-fellowes well met. He hath no eyes that hee can see with, because the Sunne shines not in his Region, and as for Candle-light, he needs it not, because his chiefest trade consists in groping out his worke. The Waspes belike doe hire his vaults and Cellars
<pb facs="tcp:6450:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to inhabite in, but what rent they pay him, or what Tenants they prove, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell: but I should think he were even as good to forgo his rent quite, as to demand it at their hands. He is the true Spirit of the earth, that causeth such Earthquakes, as would make a world of Ants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Doomes-day were come. He is an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, and a publicke Bando set forth against him, with a reward of fiftie Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedes proposed to any, that shall bring him to the Lord of the Soile either dead or alive.

motion of his body. He is very circumspect, but tis but to see who notes him, and very carefull of his carriage, because he knows he hath many eyes upon him. Hee is no Mercer of Cheape-side who keepes a constant shop at home, but a Pedlar rather that carries his packe about him, which he will open every foot, but sells no ware, he sets so great a price upon them. If you looke on them, hee cares for no more; but if you take off your eye once, he will bee in his dumpes straight, put up his packe, and go his wayes. Hee is

no Goldsmith on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, who utters plate and that by weight, but a right Ieweller who deales with nothing else but jemmes, a commoditie more light, but yet of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter price. The truth is, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is a true Feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Blacke friers,</hi> but none buies at his shop but giddy heads; for the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strige</hi> is more in request, and puts him by his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. It is a merry world with him, who alwayes carries his Spring about him, where every Feather is a rare Tulip. When he is disposed hee will keepe State, but it is in the Hall
<pb facs="tcp:6450:57"/>
onely all for shew, for in the Dining roome there is but poore doings, because hee spends all on fine cloathes, and bestowes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on his belly. He hath a Turret to his Palace, where his head stands like a Weather-cocke as fickle as it: for it will turne and wind on this side and that side with everie puffe of vanitie. When he hath all his accoutrements about him, you would take him to be a tall ship well rig'd and deckt with streamers top and top gallant, but no Merchant man, because no substance in him. He is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry spruce and neat, and
<pb facs="tcp:6450:57"/>
can abide no sordities at all, and wil make you sport to see how gingerly he wil passe over a heape of dust. He is wise, but tis but in his owne opinion, for hee is such a prodigall that once a yeare he turns bankrupt; and then shall you heare him cry a myle off as one that had lost all. Were it not yet for his pride, hee might be an Angel among Birds, whereas now he is a <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and altogether as proud as he: which may be the reason he hates the Serpent so much; for proud folkes can never agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or else because hee borrowed his head of him,

and especially the Yeomens houses, where he findes his chiefest rost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat.

If he walke abroad at any time, it is towards the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, where hee will fetch you a turne or two, till he can see no more, and then goes to bed to save candlelight, and perhaps supperlesse too, for I am not privie with his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie diet. When they are Infants, and but newly weaned from the breast, they feede them with Gnats, a great Regalo with them. They are well toothed, for they bite shrewdly, the reason is, because they are not given to fruit, so as it is a rare matter to heare of a Barber sent for to them to draw a

He that should see them but even now to walke on the ground like drowned Mice, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately got up a cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse, not knowing the mistery of their wings, would wonder what up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start fellowes they were, so sodainly prickt up to honours.

<pb facs="tcp:6450:61"/>
wrought truely not of Silke, nor woven with Threed or Cruell, but is rather a downy stuffe as will never be thred-bare, though it be worne winter &amp; summer, or whole ages. It is commonly betweene an Olive colour, and a Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, curiously mingled in the stuffe; not died, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and so good the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that they never fade or change the hew. The Birds make good use of it, who hang their houses with that Dornix, and make it serve for flock beds under their feather beds. The very rocks and stones of the desart are glad some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:6450:61"/>
to put on Ierkins of that Freeze, to defend them from the cold. It is a wooll that if it could spin and hold out a threed as well as ours, it would sell as well as Cotsall wooll, and make as good as any Kentish cloath. It were excellent to make Felts with, as I should thinke as good as any Beaver, if wee had but the art to dresse and handle it as it should be. Hee will sometimes seeme to perke up to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, while he gets him on the tops of houses, but I dare say of no pride, but charity to defend them better from the raine and

weather when they waxe old. He is no greatfeeder, for he will live in the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren'st places, and sterve the whole wildernesse besides, ere he pinch a whit. Hee is never young, or very old, but still keepes the same complexion he had at first, and beares his yeeres ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent well; a good Spring helpes him nothing, nor a hard winter empaires him a whit. He is ever in good state for soule and body no doubt, who seemes to bee so mortified a creature, as to be alwaies ready for the tomb, and yet never comes there, but lives for ever, as one may say, in this very
<pb facs="tcp:6450:62"/>
life, enjoying an endlesse rest. He is most constant in himselfe, and hates incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie in all others, so as by his will hee will have nothing to doe with any such, as appeares by the saying, that a rowling stone gathers no Mosse.

Their Common-wealth is not governed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts of <hi>Solon,</hi> or those of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> whose lawes were civill, but rather by the lawes of their corrupt nature. For though they

according to the fashion of that Country. The Boores will assemble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to severall offices for the publicke good; some to carry corne to their granaries, where a single grain is accounted a load for a sturdy Ant, and he shall brag as much of it, as ours shall do for the carrying halfe a seame of wheat, and if one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, two will joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and carry it between them. They go somtimes to the warres, but gaine more by craft then downe right blowes. They have no flying armies, because

they are foot all, and have no wings, but they have their running Armies, and then it is when they shew their heeles. In fine, they have many enemies, but like the Foxe, fare best when they are most curst.</p>

If hee take upon him to make a Tart, he will be as good as his word, for you shall be sure to have him tart enough, and so sterne that all the sugred speeches in the world will not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie him.

He is a right Brittaine, and true native of this Land, and not a Gascoigne come in with the Conquerour; which is the reason they desire to match into his stocke; wheras the Gascoignes of curtisie onely made free denizons, are nothing so regarded for antiquity. He is a very Criticke, who sharply censures every thing, but it is no matter while no man regards what hee saith, being
<pb facs="tcp:6450:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knowne to have no iudgement with him. In a word, though he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thus long, he is a man of no experience, nor hath much knowledge in him, which is so much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

them, their kindred is so worne out, as they are but quater Couzins. Hee is a Savadge in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and in the City he is every thing. In the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse he contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the Coat that Nature hath dressed him with; in the City he will be, as occasion serves: He hath notable cheeks of his owne to make a Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were it not for a great imperfection he hath, that he cannot hold his breath so long from chattering with his teeth. He is a very sloven, yet he never eates without his cut finger-gloves: He hath but an ill-favoured

foot, and a worse legge. It is to be feared he is much troubled with the stone, for he is a great sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He would make a good horseman, for hee never gaules himselfe. He hath a good wit, but the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility and dexterity of his fingers is beyond bounds. Wheras others have poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets in their slopps likely, he hath his in his Chops.

He is no Musician, because he cannot keepe an even stroke; and which is worse would breake all the
<pb facs="tcp:6450:75"/>
strings, were it onely to heare them knap asunder: To conclude, his best trade is a true Comedian, to play a Zany or Pantalon on the Stage, which hee will doe very naturally, and to the life indeed.</p>

a journey; for hee hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies his riding cloake on, his hood with glasses for his eyes to looke out at, in the spanish fashion. When he perches on a tree, hee sits like a Prince, in his chaire of estate, to give au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which he doth full sore against his will, while every one hath his owne saying, and he without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reply, faigne to consent with his nod.

Hee loves hunting well, and takes great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to hallow to the hounds.

because not sociable, but rather a Peripateticke, because a walker; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a Stoicke, because he carries all whatsoever hee hath on his backe. If hee were confined to his five miles according to the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, it would trouble him nothing, while hee would travaile where hee list, yet not incurre the forfeiture, or the penalty of the law.

Hee is a free-holder, and no tenant at will, or for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny terme that is lesse then his life. There is no cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb facs="tcp:6450:78"/>
servants amongst them, but are housholders every one. They have no constant Cities of their owne, while their houses joyne not one to another, as others doe.

grosse and earthly: not of corn, not to put the world to so much cost: nor of flesh, for they cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the flesh pots of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.

He is a tree more generous than the Walnut, while the Walnut will endure to be beaten by every boy, and his nuts to bee taken from him: but the Oake will not part with his, till hee let them goe of his owne accord: he beares his yeeres beyond measure, for let him alone, and hee will out passe <hi>Methusalems</hi> dayes, and oft times wears out many ages and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours round about him.

beneath with foot or hand, and oftentimes with his very teeth. He is indeed the Ape of Birds, and with his tongue will counterfeit more London cryes, then any Ape shall play tricks. He hath a reasonable wit, and a better memorie, but cannot a word of the book; for he is all by roat, and will con very well by heart.

he will not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken himselfe, but still lyes in wayte to catch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and therefore when men are overtaken with drinke, they are said to be foxed. Hee is a true Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer, because he provides and takes, not for the King, but for himselfe, upon no price, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is hated and cursed where he comes. Hee makes no conscience of any shifts; &amp; for a Goose, or a Ducke, or such a matter, it is but a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers tricke with him to amend his commons with, and so passes it over without any scruple at all,
<pb facs="tcp:6450:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unlesse hee be taken in the manner, and then proues it a hanging matter, which halters the case quite. Hee is a great Lecturer, but reades to a company of Geese onely, when hee will bee sure to bee well paid for his paines, with a good supper, where some one of his Auditory are present. Hee is very neat in his habit, for he alwaies carries his brush with him, especially when hee rides, for then hee carries it not at his pommell, for that were not fightly, but carries it still at the Crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. He hath a slye looke, and a notable leering eye
<pb facs="tcp:6450:93"/>
of his owne; and so good a mar-kman, as likely hee never misseth his ayme. For his eye, hee would make a notable Gunner, but that hee cannot away with a piece, especially if it lie in Ambascado, for that puts him quite out of his play. Hee cannot abide a packe of dogges, which if he should, would cost him his life. He hath his forts and holes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into, where he feares nothing but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynes to oppose and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front his; for then hee is brought to a parley with his enemies, and faine to yeeld to hard conditions:

In fine, were the world turned honest againe, and all knavery banished thence, it would be found in a Foxe skinne.</p>

               <hi>40.</hi> The Primrose</head>
            <p>IS the principall of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, because the prime and first in her prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; as the Herbinger of <hi>Flora,</hi> the Queene of flowers. Shee is the true and proper rose of the Wildernesse, where shee is in her element the earth, as fishes in the sea, and fowles in the ayre. Shee is the lowly and humble flower, and if shee want the sweet perfumes and Civits the other Roses have, shee is supplied with a sweeter odour of meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="tcp:6450:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which they want through the churlish guard about them. Shee is very courteous, and disdaines not the lappe of the Forrest Nymphs that greedily seeke after her, as the Primitias of the Spring. They make a dainty shew with them, when they sit familiarly together with their hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids the leaves: But when they take their sister Violets into their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, then they make an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable enamell. Shee is a common Prostitute to eyes, but no Strumper, because thereby she loseth no Virginity shee hath,
<pb facs="tcp:6450:95"/>
but still remaineth hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly chaste in her mothers lap, till shee bee violently snatcht away, and ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed thence, keeping her integrity still, so long as forced against her will. Shee keepes willingly in the wildernesse, to shunne the company of men, but yet is no Anchoresse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no recluse, but a right Hermitresse, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the deserts. Their habit and dressing is suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Spring, and the summers approach. In fine, I could wish the Primrose were restored to her former state againe; for then I should hope
<pb facs="tcp:6450:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the golden age wherein shee flourished in times past, would happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe.</p>
