            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Enſuing Sheets being the Work of ſome ſpare Hours laſt Winter Mornings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> redeemed; not from my Employment or particular Calling, but from my Reſt and Sleep: I know not unto whom of Right, it doth more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, than to your Worſhip; knowing that as you are my Governour, my Perſon is under your Protection, and my Manners fall under your Inſpection.</p>
            <p>I thought it meet therefore, that a Work of this Nature coming from me, ſhould make its Acknowledgments to your Worſhip; and I do
<pb facs="tcp:44508:3"/>
hereby Humbly ſubmit, both the Work and the Author of it, to your Worſhips Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judgment and Cenſure. And in doing this, I know not how to give your Worſhip flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Titles, not only (though chiefly) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſo doing my Maker would be offended, but alſo, becauſe I have Reaſon to believe, that your Worſhip is ſo Noble, and ſo truly Great; that 'tis as much below your Worſhip to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, as it is Breach of Duty in me to give them. Nor ſhall I with a Pretended ſhew of Humility, (the worſt of all Pride) make any Apology, with a pretended Humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Pardon for doing thus; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſo doing, I ſhould be guilty of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, having already (as in Reaſon I ought) ſubmitted both the Work and my Self, to your Worſhips Impartial Judgment and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>And knowing alſo, ſuch is the Gentleneſs and Candor of your Government, that Sins of Ignorance and Infirmity are diſcountenanc'd, and ſuppreſs'd with Admonition and Reproof; or elfe puniſh'd with ſuch Gentle and Fatherly Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifement, as may ſerve only for an Effectual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to future Reformation. And I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your Worſhip, (our Lord Jeſus Chriſt who knoweth all things bearing me witneſs I lye not) that at firſt, and all the while I employ'd my Thoughts about the VVork it ſelf, and of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ſame to your Worſhips moſt ſolid and penetrating Judgment; I could not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one Thought, of abuſing Good Nature and a Gentle Governour at ſuch an Unreaſonable,
<pb facs="tcp:44508:3"/>
Wicked Rate, as ſinning wilfully in Hope of a Pardon will amount unto.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible, your Worſhip is called by the Good Providence of God, and the Voice of this City, to Much and Great Buſineſs in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, both in this City and for this City and Nation; among the Chief of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tribes, the Heads of their Fathers Houſes, Men of Renown who have been and are to Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together in Parliament; to Enquire and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what our <hi>Engliſh Iſrael</hi> ought to do: (That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may direct your Counſels, and bleſs your Reſolves, is and ought to be the Prayer of every true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.)</p>
            <p>I ſhall not therefore preſume, to detain your Worſhip with a Long Entry to a ſmall Cottage; yet I think my Self obliged, to render to your Worſhip a Reaſon for my doing thus; and among others this is one, There is a Generation ariſen up among us, who call themſelves <hi>Wits, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>of the Common-wealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but they prove themſelves to be no other than a Select Number of Conceited Dunces, who are far enough from being Freemen of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Sound Reaſon: And there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, no ſuch thing as the Common-wealth of Learning, that being a good Gift of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd but upon ſome; but Reaſon is given by the ſame Author of every Good and Perfect Gift, to Men as ſuch; yet neither is this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal in common to all Men in any great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof, witneſs our Pretenders thereunto.</p>
            <p>And yet ſo vain are theſe Conceited Ones,
<pb facs="tcp:44508:4"/>
(and of all Fools they are the worſt) that they not only ſay, they are <hi>Freemen of the Common-wealth of Wit and Learning;</hi> but they will needs make themſelves (as Uſurpers in all caſes do) Maſters and Magiſtrates of that which is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to both; <hi>viz.</hi> The Common-wealth of Sound Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that ſo many Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Letters have been ſent to our Noble Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, with bold and preſumptuous Exhortations to make Uſe of their Reaſon; as if Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were an Enemy to Humanity: Or as if Faith deſtroyed Reaſon, charging all the Laity, as well the Nobility and Gentry; as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monality and more inferiour <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> to be no better than <hi>Biggots</hi> to the Clergy? And the Clergy no better, than Arbitrary Impoſers of Idolatrous Doctrines.</p>
            <p>Since therefore, theſe Bold Invaders on the Rights of Mankind in point of Reaſon, (as if they had ingroſs'd it all into their own Hands) are grown ſo Vain and Inſolent, as to ſet Bounds not only to God's Word, but to God himſelf; they not having the Fear of God before their Eyes, form an Idea of God according to the Dictates of their own Fooliſh Brains: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God ſaith of himſelf, yet he muſt be no other than what they ſay he is; and in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability the next Step will be, to ſay, he is not.</p>
            <p>I therefore look'd for ſome Anſwers to thoſe Unreaſonable, as well as Unſcriptural Pamphlets from our Reverend Divines; but finding theſe Pretenders had this Shift, to put off what the Clergy had ſaid; And to amuſe their Readers,
<pb facs="tcp:44508:4"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> That the Laity, and efpecially the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Sort, take thoſe things upon Truſt, and are led by the Noſe by the Clergy.</p>
            <p>To Convince therefore theſe Gainſayers, and to Honour our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to let thoſe Gentlemen know, that we Lay-men do ſee with our own Eyes; and that every true Chriſtian (tho' the meaneſt of <hi>Mechanicks)</hi> is not taught by the Clergy only, but by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Word of God; to <hi>Honour the Son even as we Honour the Father.</hi> For theſe Reaſons, have I thus employed thoſe Redeemed Hours, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as your Worſhip hath an Undoubted Right, to judge both the Author and his Work; ſo I Humbly take Leave to caſt both at your Worſhips Feet, and Subſcribe my Self as I am,</p>

            <head>To the Rational READER.</head>
            <p>IT is to be Lamented, but not to be Wondered at, becauſe it is foretold and Propheſied of; <hi>that in the laſt days,</hi> and therefore in our days, <hi>many Falſe teachers ſhall ariſe, and deceive many;</hi> i. e. So many, that if it were poſſible, they ſhould deceive the very Elect; many ſaying, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt, and lo there;</hi> ſome ſaying, <hi>this is he,</hi> and others ſaying, <hi>that is he;</hi> Mat. <hi>24. 23, 24.</hi> The Devil and his Imps ſetting up many Chriſts, if by any means they can delude poor Souls, and draw them from the true Chriſt; but our Lord hath forwarned us, not to go after them, becauſe he hath told us theſe things before, <hi>Mat. 24. 25. Mark. 13. 21, 22.</hi> And being forewarned, I truſt by the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; we ſhall be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, (all his Diſciples, even we Lay. Men not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) and be enabled to withſtand, and to ſtand againſt all the Seducers, the cunningly deviſing Fable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of our day: And for the incouragement of our Faith, and Hope we ought to remember, that the Promiſe of impoſſibility of being deceived, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Miniſtry, but to all Gods Elect, to every true Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt. And it is almoſt in ſo many words foretold (at leaſt, it is plainly imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that many of the Miniſtery, many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Miniſters of Chriſt, ſhould be thoſe very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
<pb facs="tcp:44508:6"/>
themſelves; Why elſe doth our Lord call them <hi>falſe Prophets, falſe Chriſts;</hi> Mat. 24. 23. Mark 13. 21. 22. and <hi>falſe Teachers, 2</hi> Pet. 2. 1. It's thoſe Wolves coming in Sheeps Clothing; that do ſo diſturb the Church, and in a great meaſure take Peace from the ſame; and by there pretentions to Reaſon and great ſwelling Words of Vanity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their great Reaſon and Learning, <hi>Lead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſilly Women, laden with divers luſts:</hi> And for ought I know, as many ſilly Men too. Hence it comes to paſs, that although the Preaching the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel, be the moſt Honourable and Glorious Imployment, that ever God call'd a Mortal to in this World: Yet becauſe many of the Sons of <hi>Ely,</hi> do ſo manifeſtly declare themſelves to be the Sons of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial;</hi> the offerings of the Lord are abhorred for the Prieſts ſake. It is to be lamented, and I cannot without grief of Heart write it, nor think on it; that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould be ſo much ſlighted, contemned and deſpiſed, as at this day they are; becauſe I Read the Bible, and there I find our Lord ſaith, ſpeaking of his Miniſters to be ſure, if not of all his Diſciples; <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> And I dread what the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the deſpiſing of Chriſt, and him that ſent him will amount unto; and yet I am no more a Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to their Miniſtry, than I am a diſpiſer of them. For however mean or Contemptible my Circumſtances and Imployment may be in the World, yet it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to Bleſs me with ſuch a <hi>Berean</hi> Spirit, that by the Grace of God, I will neither follow their Doctrine, nor their Practice any further then I have good Warrant from the Word of God; that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their and my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.
<pb facs="tcp:44508:6"/>
And therefore, if thou ask me what I think ſhould be the Reaſon, why in a profeſſed Chriſtian Nation a Chriſtian Miniſtry is ſo much deſpiſed, I muſt needs ſay, I think they may thank themſelves for it; for when by the Grace of God, a Church or Miniſtry is made Beautiful as <hi>Tirzah,</hi> the ſame Grace will make them as <hi>terrible as an Army with banners;</hi> Cant. 6. ver. 4. And although the World hates them, yet <hi>Herod</hi> like, they muſt fear them, although they kill them; and they kill them becauſe they fear them, as well as hate them. Chriſt will honour them that honour him, and although Chriſt Diſciples muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Perſecution, and be Reproached and Vilified; yet at the ſame time, the fear and the dread of them, muſt fall upon thoſe very beaſts that worry them. And therefore it is obſervable, that in times of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution the Church and her Miniſters are hated and troubled on every ſide. But at the ſame time they are feared, not ſlighted; their Perſecutors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved with Envy, rather then Contempt. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the fire of Perſecution makes them more bright and Beautiful, and therefore more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: But when there is Peace to the Church, from outward Perſecution; and as in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, great Worldly Grandeur is added thereunto; then is the time for the Devil to Play his Pranks another way, by ſending in falſe Brethren among them, to preach the Goſpel for filthy Lucre ſake: And at this very door, it is that many of the loweſt of the People are Let in to be Prieſts; and which is worſe, if worſe can be, many of the loweſt of the People make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Prieſts: But which way ſo ever they get in, whether by the negligence or ignorance of the Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers; or whether they Climb up ſome other way: It is too Evident, that too many of theſe ſorry Tools
<pb facs="tcp:44508:7"/>
are in to the diſhonour of the Miniſtry; and when they are in, it is no wonder though they quickly diſcover themſelves to be as they are; and when they do ſo diſcover themſelves it is no wonder, if the loweſt of the People do look upon them, as lower than themſelves, and that muſt be very low indeed. It is very ſad, that our Biſhops the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould have ſuch an unjuſtifiable and diſhonourable regard for <hi>Ely's</hi> Seed, ſeeing the Lord hath rejected them from being Prieſts to miniſter before him; and yet when any of theſe fulfil the Curſe that was pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that good Mans wicked Seed, and comes and croucheth to them for a peice of Silver, and a Morſel of bread, ſaying, put me I pray thee into one of the Prieſt Offices, that I may have a piece of Silver, and a piece of bread, preſently they are ready to lay Hands on them. But I would to God they would rather reject all ſuch Petitions and Petitioners, with the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcorn to the Petition; and the Greateſt pity and Compaſſion and Fatherly Admonition to the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. But no doubt the Aged <hi>Pauls</hi> of our day, would willingly ſee young <hi>Timothies</hi> growing up in their ſtead: And why then do they not obſerve the Rule given to the Firſt Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus, to lay hands ſuddenly on no Man, nor at any time upon a Novice, but on ſuch as deſire the Office of a Biſhop;</hi> becauſe it is a good Work, and to prove them too; for this was to be done before they took the Office of a Deacon, how much more before they took the Office of a Biſhop; and for want of this it is, (I am greived to ſee it, and ſo are other Chriſtians to) that the Miniſters of the Goſpel are in general, and the Goſpel it ſelf is ſo much ſlighted and deſpiſed. There is not that Majeſty and Luſtre upon Miniſters and Chriſtians, as there was in the Primitive times; and
<pb facs="tcp:44508:7"/>
no wonder if Men ſlight, when God departs; nor is it to be thought ſtrange, if the Miniſtry it ſelf be ſlighted in the General, when there are ſo many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that know not how to divide the Word of Truth aright; and therefore they ſpake not as the Miniſters of Chriſt, as being called and ſent of God to Preach the Everlaſting Goſpel; but as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and low Spirited time-ſervers, that can Tell a Tale out of <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> but are far enough from being like <hi>Ezra,</hi> who read in the Book of the Law, and gave the Senſe and the Meaning; the Goſpel and Epiſtles to the Primitive Chriſtians being ſeldom mentioned, or if they be either not Explained, or miſerably perverted to ſet up ſome other Chriſt; or ſome other Saviour beſides our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: For alaſs poor Creatures they know not what the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Lord, nor the Conſolations of the Holy Ghoſt are themſelves: And how then can they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men to be Chriſtians? they are ſtrangers to the New Birth themſelves, and how can they give any account of thoſe things they have not ſeen, nor felt. Theſe things are to be Lamented, and ſhall be reformed when God cauſeth Glory to dwell in our Church and Land. It is in vain for Men: In vain did I ſay, it is a ſin and a ſhame for Men to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in chuſing of Miniſters, one would think the Goſpel ſhould Teach us ſo much good Manners, as to let God chooſe firſt; And when he hath given ſome viſible Demonſtrations who he hath Choſen, then to ſet ſuch apart by Faſting and Prayer, and laying on the Hands of the <hi>Presbytery:</hi> So ſhall they revive the Glory that is due to the Goſpel Miniſtry, by having none but Work men among them, that are able to divide the Word of Truth aright, and ſo need not to be aſhamed either of the Goſpel, or a
<pb facs="tcp:44508:8"/>
ſhame to it; being ſound in the Faith, and having the Spirit may Convince gain-ſayers: For want of a due regard hereunto, the Church hath too many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and too many put too much Contempt on the whole Miniſtry, for the ſake of ſome Pretenders thereunto. But that which is worſe then all this, is, the Enemies of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of his Grace; take occaſion hereby to Aſſault the very Foundation of the Chriſtian Religion; and finding many in the Miniſtry, ſome of the loweſt of the People, before ſpoken of; who are either prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to receive their Principles, or not Fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
            <p>They grow inſolent, and becauſe a Novice, or an <hi>Arminian</hi> cannot Confute them for want of a Spirit of Judgment and of a ſound Mind, they are ready to ſay, neither can a Miniſter of the Goſpel do it. And indeed it is a Queſtion which perhaps a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> cannot readily determine, whether it be harder for an <hi>Arminian</hi> to Confute a <hi>Socinian,</hi> or for a <hi>Socinian</hi> to Confute an Atheiſt; for there is a connexion and a dependancy in thoſe damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, for the denying the full ſatisfaction that Chriſt made to Divine Juſtice for our ſin, and our being Juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Chriſts Blood, makes way to deny the Deity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the denying the Divine Nature of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, makes way for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the being of God, <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> naturally run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> as naturally into <hi>Atheſim;</hi> as I truſt Rational Reader thou wilt ſee by the inſuing Diſcourſe, that the moſt <hi>Goliah</hi> like Arguments that our Pretenders to Reaſon have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Lye with equal force againſt the very being of God. Theſe Gentlemen
<pb facs="tcp:44508:8"/>
having Formed an Idea of Religion, and of God himſelf, according to that little Meaſure of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon God hath beſtowed upon them; and that Reaſon wofully Corrupted, they all three ſet this down for a Rule, and tell us in ſo many Words that what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Reaſon cannot be True; and being very Conceited, as thou knoweſt Rational Reader, moſt of our Weak and and Half Witted People are, they tell us, (what ever God tell us in his Word to the contrary, no matter for that:) That one infinite Saviour is not ſufficient to grapple with an in numerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſins and Guilts; each of which they will have to be infinite: But thy Reaſon will tell thee their Argument will aſſoon deſtroy the being of God, as over throw the Satisfaction of Chriſt: They alſo tell us <hi>the Father, the Word, and Holy Ghoſt cannot be one, that ſin cannot be Forgiven, if the guilty be not Cleared;</hi> and yet God himſelf ſaith, <hi>he will not Clear the guilty, and yet he will Forgive ſin:</hi> And to carry on their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereſies with a high Hand, they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up for Maſtersof Reaſon, Freemen of the Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Wit and Learning: But thou wilt ſee Reader, by the enſuing Diſcourſe, that they are quite otherwiſe, and that they prove themſelves to be no other then a ſhame to Learning, a diſhonour to the Schools, a reproach to ſound Reaſon, a ſcandal to the Goſpel, Enemies to the Crown and Dignity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Factors to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm.</p>
            <p>Now Reader, I ſhall not detain thee any longer at the Door, then to tell thee how I being no Prophet nor Prophets Son, came to be ingaged in a Work of this Nature: And indeed it was an unexpected Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that led me to it, I being at a Friends Houſe
<pb facs="tcp:44508:9"/>
ſome Months ſince I Accidently ſaw the two Books mentioned in the Title <hi>Page;</hi> and by that tranſient view that I had of them while I was there; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they ſtruck at the Foundation of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, I therefore deſired to Borrow them that I might inquire by the Scriptures of Truth, whether thoſe things were ſo or no; my requeſt was readily granted, and accordingly at ſpare Times and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Hours, (for I reſolved not to Loſe one Hours Time from my Imployment for it,) but I ſay at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Hours I did look over thoſe Books, comparing the things that were therein aſſerted with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth, and ſound Reaſon drawn from the ſame: And I do Freely acknowledge that at firſt I was ſomewhat Staggered in my Faith; and indeed Had I not been almoſt turned aſide from the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Goſpel thou hadſt never ſeen any thing of this Nature coming from me, nor ſhould I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited my Tuoughts about thoſe things to Paper and Ink, but finding the things that were ſo confidently denyed and Contended againſt, was not about Meats or Drinks, or a Holy-day, or a White or a Black Garment, and ſuch like Trifles as theſe which makes them that obſerve them never the better; nor they that obſerve them not never the worſe, but the matters contended about being no leſs then denying, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the true God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, I reſolved by the Grace of God to find out the Truth as it is in Jeſus; and therefore I gave the more earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heed both to theſe Books, and the Reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in offered, to maintain the things that were ſo boldly aſſerted; as alſo to the Scriptures of Truth and ſound Reaſon drawn from the ſame. And I can truly ſay the more I lookt into both, the more I were confirmed in my Faith, and the more clearly did I ſee
<pb facs="tcp:44508:9"/>
the unreaſonableneſs, though deep ſubtilty and cuning Sophiſtry of the Arguments that were laid down in thoſe Books for denying our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be over all, God bleſſed for ever more; and for my own Memory ſake I at firſt commited ſome Remarks, to Paper and Ink, and ſhewing them to a Friend, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to go on further in it; Which accordingly I did, and having almoſt finiſht what I thought to do with reſpect to thoſe two Books, I Communicated it to another Friend, and he ſhewed me and Lent me the great Boaſting, vain Glorious <hi>Conſiderator</hi> upon Four Sermons of his Grace the Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> a Diſcourſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Sarums;</hi> another of the Biſhop of <hi>Worſter,</hi> and an Eminent <hi>Diſſenter;</hi> and I have now forgot who beſides: And he ſtumps it about like a <hi>Haberdaſher</hi> of ſmall Wits againſt his Grace the Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi> charges the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Sarum</hi> with a Diſſent from the Catholick Church; and doth in Effect tell his Lordſhip, though he be a Dignity of the Church; yet he muſt vail the Bonnet to him, as being a Freeman of the Common wealth of Wit and Learning; and ſeems willing to perſwade the the World that he is guilty of Sacriledge; and that he hath Robb'd the Church of ſome of her beſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments next to the Righteouſneſs of Cnriſt imputed to her, and the Graces of his Holy Spirit wrought in her; <hi>viz.</hi> Her Wit and Learning: And as for the firſt of the Former, and which indeed Conſtitutes her Truly Christian, viz. the Righteouſneſs of Christ imputed to her; he will not own that ſhe hath any Right or Title to it; or that ſhe ſhall ever be made partaker of it.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Second,</hi> viz. The inwrought Graces of the Holy Spirit, and which indeed makes
<pb facs="tcp:44508:10"/>
her truly Glorious, he hath brought up an evil Report upon it, and will have it to be no other then Painted Paper-morality common to the Heathen: And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to perſwade the World to believe him, He tells us, he is a Freeman of the Common-wealth of Wit and Learning.</p>
            <p>What a mortification muſt it be to this Gentleman, when he ſhall ſee that a Man of a mean capacity and Employment, that never had the happineſs to ſit at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> can ſee through his Sophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; And yet it muſt be acknowledged by all Men of common Senſe, that the Schools will give a Man great advantages in many things, if he have but anſwerable Meaſures of Reaſon, to improve the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that may be attained there; but Block-heads and Dunces muſt look like themſelves, as well when Poſting from, as when Whipt to and in the Cities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge.</hi> For indeed the Schools know better then to pretend to give Men Reaſon, much leſs Vertue or Grace; and yet we have a ſort of ſoft-pated Gentlemen, who becauſe they can ſpeak Three Languages, beſides their Mother Tongue, will needs count themſelves wiſe Men, Ay, and good Divines too; but they will not paſs for ſuch, among thoſe that know what ſound Reaſon and True Divinity is.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Coſiderator</hi> by his Vanity and Boaſting, ſeems to be one of thoſe Paper-ſcull'd Gentlemen, I have therefore given him an Anſwer to ſome of his Arguments leaſt he ſhould continue to be wiſe in his own Conceit, and to let him know, that it better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſuch weak headed (tho' perhaps well-meaning Gentlemen as he) to learn of the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> than to contend with the Learned, eſpecially ſuch of them as have anſwerable meaſures of Reaſon to improve the
<pb facs="tcp:44508:10"/>
Knowledge they have attain'd by Learning for the ſame end for which God gave it them: And I have taken Notice but of ſome of his Arguments nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe notwithſtanding his great ſwelling Words of Vanity; yet I find all his Arguments are briefly couch'd, or may be reduced to our Short <hi>Accountant;</hi> and to give that Gentleman his due, he is as Stout a Champion for their Cauſe as the beſt of them all, and ſo much the better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not ſo vain as the <hi>Conſiderator;</hi> I thought therefore I ought not to let the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> paſs without a Repremand for his ſawcy inſulting over the Dignities of the Church, and thou wilt find Reader it is but a Reaſonable one; for I have quoted him Truly and Fairly, as thou wilt ſee, if thou compare Books; and as for the <hi>Accountant</hi> I have Tranſcribed his Arguments almoſt word for word, at leaſt I have not knowingly omitted one Material Word in all his Book. Now Reader, I ſhall leave thee to Judge for thy Self, whether it will be ſafeſt for thee to believe God to be as he himſelf ſaith he is, or as pretendingly Wiſe, but real Fooliſh Men ſay he is: And if thou receive any Benefit by this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, let it be a Motive to thee not to lean to thy own underſtanding, but to live by Faith on him that gives Wiſdom to the ſimple, and underſtanding to them that have no knowledge: And if what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten may have any influence thereunto, and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to honour the Son even as we honour the Father, he hath his end; who is thine to ſerve thee ſo far as it is Reaſonable for thee to Command, or him to obey.</p>

            <head>A Reaſonable Word TO THE DOCTORS OF REASON.</head>
            <p>OUR Nameleſs Author in his <hi>Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity aſſerted,</hi> ſpends his <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> Pages in laying down gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules, which muſt be uſed in diſcerning Truth from Error; that we may not be deceived. I ſhall therefore paſs over thoſe two Pages, and conſider how well he keeps to thoſe Rules, or to the Rules of Scripture; or right Reaſon, which he pretends to be ſo Great a Maſter of in clearing ſo Great a Controverſie; and which is ſo great a Myſtery. And firſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with his Reaſons, which he lays down as a Foundation to build a Faith upon; that ſhall reach to Heaven. And he goes on, and proſpers in this building; about as far as the Men of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> did, in their building in the Land of <hi>Shinar, Gen.</hi> 11. 2, 7. Indeed his Reaſon is as much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44508:12"/>
confounded as their Language was, for they did but contradict, and ſo not underſtand one another; and yet perhaps as great Doctors of Reaſon among them as our <hi>Author</hi> himſelf: He tells us in <hi>page</hi> 5. that we have a Power of Reaſoning, or Faculty of encreaſing our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by Induſtry; whereby we come to a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in many things.</p>
            <p>Hence I gather from my Author's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, that there are various Degrees and Meaſures of Reaſon; which the moſt High God is pleaſed to give to every Man, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the good Pleaſure of his own Will; to ſome more, and to ſome leſs; and to ſome (ſo far as appears to By-ſtanders) none at all, and others, he is pleaſed to take their Reaſon from them after they have had it; witneſs <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and our <hi>Bethlem.</hi> Now then, ſeeing God is one, and his Truth is one, and the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever: What an unreaſonable Reaſon, doth the ſhort Accountant give for his Faith in his <hi>3d. page?</hi> Where he with ſeeming Triumph tells us, that he therefore believes what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals, becauſe he hath reaſon ſo to do: And what if this Gentleman had no Reaſon, muſt God's Word ceaſe to be Truth, becauſe he hath no reaſon to be believe it? And what if he had ſome Reaſon, but not ſo much as now he pretends to; and what if ſome have a great deal more than he, as I have ſome Reaſon to believe there are that have. Is it reaſonable to ſay, God's Word is true or falſe, right or wrong, according to the Meaſure of Reaſon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44508:12"/>
that God hath given to every Man. If this be not unreaſonable Nonſence, I know not what is? Thus is the Word of Truth fulfill'd, <hi>He that leaneth to his own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is a Fool:</hi> That there is Reaſon, to believe what God reveals is certain; and to believe what God reveals becauſe he reveals it, is to make God's Truth and Power the Reaſon and Foundation of our Faith; but to believe what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals, only becauſe it is agreeable to our reaſon, is both irrational and abſurd: For thereby we make our fooliſh Reaſon, the Rule and Standard of God's Truth; and not only ſo, but of the very Being of God himſelf; ſo that if God doth reveal, that the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt is one God; and that this one God is the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, this Gentleman will not believe it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Reaſon doth not comprehend it. So that becauſe he cannot find out the Almighty to Perfection, therefore he will not believe him to be, what he ſaith he is: Thus when the Light ſhineth in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehendeth it not; then the Light muſt ceaſe to be Light, becauſe the Darkneſs cannot comprehend it. Theſe are our Doctors of Reaſon, or rather our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Doctors, who profeſſing themſelves wiſe are become Fools, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22. If you tell me that you cannot believe, except you have Reaſon ſo to do; becauſe then your Faith would be unreaſonable, and unreaſonable Men and faithleſs Men, are joyned together in Scripture, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. I anſwer, the Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44508:13"/>
of Unbelief lies in this; That it makes God a Liar, who is Truth it ſelf; and that Men following the Dictates of their own Reaſon, cannot comprehend nor will their Wills ſubmit to God's Will. Hence it is, that Carnal Reaſon is Enmity againſt God, and whereas you tell us <hi>page 6. Colume</hi> 2. of your <hi>Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity aſſerted:</hi> That the Reaſon you plead for, is not Carnal or Corrupt Reaſon, it being right Reaſon you plead for: Yet it is evident enough that you are wrong, notwithſtanding all your Pretenſions to right Reaſon; for you confine Carnal Reaſon to the inordinate Appetites of the fleſh, ſuch as drunkenneſs and the like; which the Reaſon of the Heathens did ſee plain enough, was very unreaſonable. Now in this you are not right, for the <hi>World by Wiſdom knew not God; 1 Cor</hi> 1. 21. Now the World never accounted theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities their Wiſdom, at leaſt the wiſe Men of the World never did: And I have reaſon to believe, <hi>Panl</hi> had as good a ſtock of this Reaſon you plead for, before his Converſion as your ſelf Sir; or any of the other ſix Wiſe Maſters of Reaſon: For as touching the Law, he tells you, he was blameleſs; and doth not the Law forbid Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, and the like; and yet at this time a day, he was much about as great an Enemy to Chriſt, and the way of Salvation by him as your ſelf Sir. For he verily thought, he ought to do many things againſt the Name of Jeſus; God grant you may be, as great a Friend to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you dye, as <hi>Paul</hi> was. And it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable indeed Sir, that you conſider, what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44508:13"/>
was the grand Error and Miſtake, not only of <hi>Paul,</hi> but of the whole Body of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who continued in Unbelief; they could not believe that that ſame Jeſus was the Lord of Life. For <hi>Paul</hi> tells you, that had they known it, they would not have crucified him; they could ſee, that he was Man plain enough, and a Holy Man too, but their Reaſon would not let them ſee that he was more than Man; except ſuch as God was pleaſed to reveal his Son unto, as in <hi>Paul.</hi> But my Author in his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity aſſerted,</hi> tells us in <hi>page 5. Colume</hi> 2. that theſe Lights which he had before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, namely, <hi>Senſe, Reaſon, and Revelation, muſt not contradict each other;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Our Senſe is given as a ground to work upon; and our Reaſon as a means to aſſiſt, and compleat the Knowledge we receive by Senſation; and Revelation can't be receiv'd, but by Means of theſe two former.</hi> 'Till now; No, nor yet neither do I underſtand, that Senſe is a Foundation for Faith; nor that Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is confin'd to our Reaſon; nay, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is Evident; and to ſay, or (think that it is ſo) is to make God like our ſelves; but ſuch Fools God himſelf will reprove, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. Nor is our Reaſon, till truly rectified by the Spirit of God, a means to receive the revealed Will of God; nay, it is the main thing, that oppoſeth the great Myſtery of God's revealed Will in the Goſpel: For the Carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God, and cannot be Subject to the Law, nor reveal'd Will of God; and that not only the Reaſon of the Drunkard;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44508:14"/>
(as before mentioned) but that which Men call true Reaſon; though it be far enough from being ſo: Nay, our Author goes on in the greatneſs of his Reaſon, or rather in the madneſs of his Folly; and ſaith, <hi>We cannot without the greateſt Folly, ſuppoſe a thing can be reveal'd to us, contrary to our Senſe or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> and thinks he hath ſufficiently prov'd it, by ſaying God cannot tell us, <hi>White is black, or that two and one is not three, or that a Debt that is freely forgiven is fully paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this you are not Wiſe, for I will ſhow you that God is greater than Man, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 12. and there is nothing more true, and certain than this truth; that the God of truth cannot Lye, and there is nothing more true, and ſelf Evident than that God calls that White, which the Wiſe Men of this World call Black, oppoſing their Reaſon againſt the revealed Will of God, ſtill ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt God; ſo that what God reveals to be Good, proud, fooliſh Man will call Evil. Ay Sir, and as great Doctors of Reaſon as your ſelf; or elſe how come the Wiſe Men and Scribes, to have a hand in our Lords Death, and to think they did God good Service, when they kill'd his Diſciples. Doubtleſs, their Reaſon ſuch as it was, (and they might have as good a Stock of it as your ſelf Sir, for ought I know;) I ſay, their Reaſon thought it reaſonable ſo to do; and it is not long ſince, one of your Doctors of Reaſon told us, if I am not miſ-informed, there was no God in his <hi>Leviathan;</hi> and for ought I know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44508:14"/>
he might have as good Reaſon ſo to do, as you have, to deny our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be God: But our Author goes hobbling on, according to that little blind Reaſon he hath; and can any Man think it ſtrange that he ſtumbles, when he kicks at the very Fountain of Light and Life: OUr Author is like one of <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> conceited Lords, ſpoken of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 2. 31. and therefore, he will not come to him, in whom are hid all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 3. No, he is ſo far from that, that he will tell God to his Face, that a Debt freely Forgiven, and yet fully Paid, is a contradiction: For what doth it ſignifie, for God to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a God pardoning iniquity, forgiving tranſgreſſion and ſin, and yet a God, that will by no means clear the guilty. This is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in this Gentlemans Reaſon, and therefore, cannot be true by Revelation; Short Accountant, <hi>Page</hi> the Third, <hi>Reaſon</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>Yet leaſt our ſhort Accountant ſhould Charge me with being too ſhort, in given up his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Reaſons; for his denying the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be over All, God bleſſed for every more: I muſt ſtep back to his <hi>2d. Page,</hi> where after he hath given ſome Account of the unkind, (and if all be as he relates it) unjuſtiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble carriage of Biſhop <hi>R. S.</hi> and the Church under his Care towards him. He begins to lay down his Reaſons, which I ſhall conſider, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any notice of their Relative Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects one to another; I having nothing to do
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44508:15"/>
with either the <hi>Biſhop R. S.</hi> or the Church, over which he is Overſeer. I not knowing this ſhort Accountant nor <hi>B. R. S.</hi> nor any of his Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that I know of; no, not ſo much as by Sight or Name, till ſince I ſee <hi>R. S.</hi> on this Subject, and upon inquiring after that, I have been told his Name. To begin therefore with the Account he gives of himſelf, he ſaith, <hi>As to his Life and Converſation, he doth not know that any hath blamed him for it, nor that he hath been charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Immorality,</hi> which is ſo far very well, and is his Mercy that God hath not left him ſo far to himſelf, as to run with many others, into the ſame exceſs of Riot: But he was not as he ſaith, <hi>Able to bear the hearing that Jeſus Chriſt who was born of the Virgin, was God by Nature, Co-equal, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal with the Father.</hi> And here I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the dark ingenuity of the Gentleman, who foreſeeing that any Chriſtian would be ready to grant that the humanity of Chriſt, which was Born of the Virgin, was not God; for then he had not been Man, but God only; and ſo we ſhould have been at a loſs for a Mediator: For there is one Mediator between God and Man, thereſore he ſaith, <hi>He was not able to bear the Notion of a Compound, of part God, and part Man, to make up one Perſon.</hi> I do not find the word, part God, and part Man in Scripture, but the Scriptures do plain enough declare, that our Mediator is true God, and true Man.</p>
            <p>But now I ſhall conſider my ſhort Accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants Reaſons, why he cannot believe him to be ſo.</p>
            <p>His firſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, <hi>becauſe God is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44508:15"/>
in Thouſand of Places of Scripture, to be One ſingle Perſon or Being; and in ſome few miſtaken and dark places, that ſeem to infer a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Perſons in the Divine Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſaith our ſhort Accountant <hi>page</hi> 3. and our Nameleſs Author <hi>pag.</hi> 7. colume 2. <hi>We muſt not oppoſe a few Texts againſt many, nor dark ones agaiuſt clear ones.</hi> Very true, and for the ſame Reaſon, we muſt not oppoſe many againſt a few, nor clear ones againſt dark ones; and here any reaſonable, unbyaſt man, may ſee how thoſe Gentlemen contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Our Author ſaith <hi>page</hi> 4. colume 1. <hi>That if a thing does not appear clear to him, he hath no good cauſe to affirm it.</hi> And by the ſame rule, if a thing appears dark to him, it is preſumptuous Folly in him to deny it; for a Man to deny that to be true, which he doth not know, or underſtand to be ſo by an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Rule; (And I hope this Gentleman will not ſay, his Reaſon is infallible in the things of a Man, much leſs in the things of God:) ſuch a Man is guilty of equal Folly with him, that affirms a thing to be true, though he do not know it to be ſo, but upon Hear-ſay; or by the Dictates of his own weak and erring Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So my Author and I are agreed in this, that Scripture cannot contradict it ſelf. But,</p>
            <p>I proceed to my ſhort Accountants <hi>Second Reaſon,</hi> which is this, <hi>That this Revelation of God as one ſingle Being or Perſon, is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Notion taat I have of God in my Mind by my Reaſon; as moſt High, Beſt, and the like.</hi> Now, tho' I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44508:16"/>
to any great ſtock, much leſs to be Maſter of infallible Reaſon; yet I muſt own, that according to that meaſure of Reaſon that God hath given me, this Argument ſeems moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and abſurd; and it is to believe a Man's Notions are true, becauſe they are his Notions; what reaſonable Proofs are theſe? For though I never ſaw <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Leviathan, yet I make no doubt, but he had as good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as this, to deny the Being of God; for what is this more or leſs, than for the <hi>Fool to ſay in his heart there is no God,</hi> and then to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this Saying or Notion of his, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it as an Argument or Reaſon, to prove that there is no God. I muſt needs ſay, that I have reaſon to believe, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not ſay in vain, that as the <hi>Fool walketh by the way his Wiſdom faileth him, and he ſaith to every one that he is a Fool;</hi> Eccleſ. 10. 3. And what if I had not reaſon enough to ſee this Truth of God, would the Truth of God be ever the leſs vailed for my Ignorance; I ſee my ſhort Accountant falls much too ſhort, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true, reaſonable Account of his Faith. But,</p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs to his <hi>Third Reaſon,</hi> and ſee if there be any more truth in that, than in his two former; and here he tells us, <hi>What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not true in Reaſon, cannot be true by Revelation:</hi> For ſaith he, (pray mark the reaſon of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Argument) <hi>What is above my Capacity to underſtand, or contradictory to my underſtanding, cannot be revealed to me:</hi> Surely, if our Accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant were not blinded with being wiſe in his own Eyes, he would have ſeen his Ignorance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44508:16"/>
in this Argument quick enough. Why, good Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is your Capacity ſolarge, and your Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great, that the one cannot be enlarg'd, nor the other enlightned; are there not ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things which your reaſon doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, which are certain Truths for all that; and is not God able to enlarge your Capacity and your Underſtanding, and make that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be truly reaſonable, which now by reaſon of your Ignorance, you can ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for; except you will ſay, that you have attain'd to the higheſt pitch of Reaſon and Underſtanding that God can give you, and conſequently that you are infallible in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, and in the very Nature and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God? And if ſo, you would do well to turn out that doating Fool at <hi>Rome,</hi> and place a wiſer in the Chair, and lay aſide the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> like, ſet up for ſome great one in the World: I ſtill ſee reaſon to guide my Reaſon by the Scriptures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe, when I ſee a Man wiſe in his own Conceit, I may have more hope of a Fool than of him: Now, though I have reaſon to believe, that our ſhort Accountant and our nameleſs Author, are Brethren in this unreaſonable Work, of denying that Jeſus Chriſt is the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and true God; as much as <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Levy</hi> were in their unreaſonable Zeal: Yet if my Reaſon fail not, I think they contradict each other: For our nameleſs Author tells us, <hi>pag. 5. colume</hi> 1. that <hi>Reaſon is a Power or Faculty, of encreaſing our Knowledge by Induſtry; whereby if
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44508:17"/>
we rightly proceed, we may come to an abſolute certainty in many things.</hi> So then Reaſon is capable of being encreas'd, and growing by Induſtry.</p>
            <p>Hence it follows, that ſmall meaſures of Reaſon, can give a Man but ſmall Certainty in many things; if in any thing, how contrary is this to my Accountants third <hi>Reaſon?</hi> whoſe Capacity is not to be enlarg'd, nor can any thing be true, that is contrary to his preſent Underſtanding; but when Reaſon is thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, my Author himſelf tells me, and I have Reaſon to believe him, that it is but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in many things; ſo that ſome things are ſtill exempted from a certain Knowledge of by Reaſon; according to my Doctor of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, his own Argument. And if any thing be exempted, ſurely Reaſon would inform a Man, that the things of God ſhould be ſome of thoſe things; eſpecially thoſe things that concern his very Being and Nature.</p>
            <p>But, to return to our ſhort Accountants Third <hi>Reaſon,</hi> for I would not hide any of his moſt comely Parts, nor diminiſh any of his ſtrongeſt Reaſons, he proceeds in his afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid pretended <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and tells us, <hi>Though he is bound to believe whatever God ſaith is True, yet it is becauſe I have Reaſon ſo to do:</hi> But ſaith he, <hi>I cannot believe the thing God ſaith, till I know what he ſaith.</hi> You are very right Mr. Doctor, the Devil will tell the truth ſometimes; but he adds, <hi>nor well believe;</hi> (pray Mark) <hi>nor well believe God ſaith ſo and ſo, till by Reaſon I am aſſured it is true:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44508:17"/>
Reaſon can never aſſent to that which appears unreaſonable, nor can I otherwiſe, than by Reaſon aſſure my ſelf, that the Scripture is a Divine Revelation.</hi> Theſe are his very words, for as I ſaid before, I will not hide his ſtrong Reaſons: The firſt part of this Third <hi>Reaſon</hi> I have Anſwered already, but he cannot well believe God ſaith ſo and ſo, till by Reaſon he is perſwaded it is true: If <hi>Abraham</hi> had had ſuch a Conceit of his Reaſon, he might have Lived and Dyed in Unbelief; for ought I know to the Contrary: For what Reaſon had he, to believe, he ſhould have a Son when his own Body was as good as Dead; <hi>and it ceaſed to be with</hi> Sarah <hi>after the manner of Women;</hi> but the revealed Word of God, and he did not ſay this is according to my Reaſon, therefore I will believe what God ſaith; no, he Argued quite otherwiſe; and ſaid, though I ſee no Reaſon for this, but a great deal againſt it; as much as ever our Accountant can pretend to be Maſter of. Yet, becauſe it is told me by that God that cannot Lye, and Almighty power being ingaged to perform it, therefore I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and therefore it is ſaid <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved againſt hope, and therefore againſt reaſon; but he would have had hope if he had had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for Hope will follow Reaſon, and it would be an unreaſonable peice of Nonſence, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction for a Man to ſay, I have Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall have ſuch a thing, but I have no hopes of it; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. Yet our Accountant will needs ſet up for a Maſter of Reaſon, though he knows not what he ſpeaks, nor where of he doth affirm:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44508:18"/>
Beſides, in this my Accountant gives no more Honour and Glory to God, by believing; then he or any Man elſe, may give to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: For when the Father of Lyes ſpeaks truth, (and that you know he will do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) then you may believe him; if by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you are aſſur'd it is true; but God is to be Believed on the Authority of his own Word. It is no wonder, that Men diſcover themſelves to be Fools, when no leſs Folly will ſatisfie them, then to kick againſt him, in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>But, I paſs to my Accountants <hi>Fourth Reaſon,</hi> in the aforeſaid Third <hi>Page, By Revelation</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we are taught, and it is no way contrary to Reaſon, that this one God is the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is this one God;</hi> Joh. 17. 1. Very true; and how forcible are right Words? but what doth your Arguing either prove or reprove from this? We are Taught by the Scriptures of truth, that Jeſus Chriſt is the True God, and Eternal Life, and that the true God is Jeſus Chriſt; 1 Ep. <hi>John</hi> 5. 20. and <hi>John</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 13. Now, whether this be contrary to my Accountants Reaſon or no, it is nevertheleſs true for all that; but I ſee no Reaſon to deny the Father to be God for all this, and if I ſhould, yet my Reaſon and the Inference would be as Juſtifiable as his; in denying the Son to be God.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Fifth Reaſon</hi> you have in his aforeſaid Third <hi>Page,</hi> (for you muſt know they being
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44508:18"/>
ſmall, will lye in a little room; <hi>Whenever God the Father, and Chriſt his Son are ſpoken of in Scripture, they are ſpoken of as two diſtinct Perſons and Beings, as</hi> Joh. 7. 16. It's certain they are ſo, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declares them to be; yet the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, are but one God for all that. And he adds, <hi>Though they are ſaid to be One in ſome Senſe, yet never but in ſuch a Senſe as God and others may be ſaid to be One,</hi> viz. <hi>in Love, Agreement and Will.</hi> One would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a Man pretending to Reaſon and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſhould not be aſhamed to tell the World ſuch an unreaſonable untruth as this; what! is Chriſt and God the Father no otherwiſe One, than God and others may be ſaid to be One; Namely, in Will and Love? Pray Sir read the 6 <hi>ver.</hi> of the <hi>Firſt</hi> of <hi>Hebrews,</hi> there God commands all his Angels to Worſhip him. Will you be ſo unreaſonable as to tell me, that God is ſo One with any of his Creatures, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the Angels of Heaven to Worſhip them? the Man Jeſus only excepted; who by virtue of his Union, and Perſonal Oneneſs with God the Son; our Mediator being God Man, he muſt have this Honour: For hath not God in the firſt Command, forbid the worſhipping any God but himſelf; and doth he not again ſay, <hi>He will not give his Glory to another, nor his Praiſe to graven Images?</hi> So then tho' Chriſt be the true God, he is not another God, and truth it ſelf ſaith, that it is the Will of God that all <hi>Men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father;</hi> John 5. 23. And why then, will you diſcover ſo much Ignorance of the Scripture, and prove
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44508:19"/>
ſo evidently that your Wiſdom, your Reaſon, is but Folly, inſtead of being a ſure guide to lead you to the Knowledge of God; and again, Chriſt tells you, if your Reaſon will but let you believe him, that <hi>as the Father knoweth me, even ſo know I the Father, Joh.</hi> 10. 15. And pray Sir, will your Reaſon tell you, that God and any others, which you ſpeak of, are ſo One, whether Angels or Men, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they know God, as God knows them; ſurely God knows all his Creatures perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Do any of his Creatures know him ſo? Thus we ſee vain Man would be counted wiſe, though it be far from him, and he is as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant as the Wild Aſſes Colt; but it is not to be much wonderd at, upon due conſideration of the matter; for how can it be otherwiſe, when a Man is ſo far left of God to himſelf, as to be wiſe in his own Eyes; and ſo neglect to Live in a Continued humble dependancy upon him, who gives Wiſdom to the ſimple, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to them that have no Knowledge; this was the ſin, and Folly of the Phariſees, who becauſe they ſaid, they did ſee, therefore their Sin and Folly remain'd with them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 41. And our Lord tells us in the <hi>39th. ver. That for Judgment I came into this World,</hi> that thoſe that were blind, and ſo made willing by Grace, to be led in the way they knew not; according to that Gracious Promiſe in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42. 16. ſhould ſee; and that they which did ſee, and were ſo conceited with their own Reaſon and Righteouſneſs, as not to ſubmit to the Righteouſneſs and Wiſdom of God, ſhould be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44508:19"/>
made blind and Dye in their Sins: Again, our Lord tells you in <hi>Joh. 5. 21. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even ſo the Son quickeneth whom he will.</hi> Now Sir, will your Reaſon tell you? or if it do tell you, and ſo delude you; can it prove to you by Sound, reaſonable Truth; that any Created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether Angel or Man, can quicken whom he will; and is this ſuch a Oneneſs, as God and others may be ſaid to be One.</p>
            <p>Unleſs I find ſome Truer, and ſo more reaſonable Arguments then theſe; I ſhall never be your Diſciple: Therefore I ſhall paſs on, and Conſider our Accountants <hi>6th. 7th.</hi> and <hi>8th.</hi> Reaſons in the <hi>4th.</hi> Page; for they are all of a ſort, and if one be confuted the reſt muſt Fall. <hi>He tells us, that thoſe things are attributed to the Father, which cannot poſſibly be ſaid of the Son, as that he is greater than all; and thoſe things are ſaid of the Son, which cannot poſſibly be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Father; or to the One that is God, as that he was conceived, grew in Wiſdom and Stature, and many other ſuch like things.</hi> Which is very true, and herein my Author ſpeaks Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably; for it would have been a very Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thing for him, to have thought of impoſing his Cunningly deviſed Fables upon the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Chriſtians; if he did not Cunningly and Deceitfully Mention ſome Truths. For it is no new thing for the Enemies of the Goſpel, to hold the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs. But Good Sir, what ſort of Logick is this? ſome things are Attributed to the Father, which cannot be ſaid of the Son; and ſome things
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44508:20"/>
are Attributed to the Son, which cannot be Attributed to the Father, which clearly ſhews that they are diſtinct; that the Father is not the Son, and that the Son is not the Father: But it doth not follow from hence, that the Son is not God; and whereas you ſay the Scripture tells us, that the Father is Greater than all; the ſame alſo it ſaith of the Son, for it is expreſsly ſaid in <hi>Rom. 9. 5. That he is over All,</hi> therefore Greater than All; <hi>God bleſſed for evermore.</hi> And for thoſe many Scriptures, that ſpeak of Chriſt, his being conceiv'd, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Wiſdom and Stature, and the Like; which cannot be Attributed to God the Father: It is our unſpeakable Comfort and happineſs, and ſhews that Chriſt God the Son, did really take our Nature upon him according to the Scriptures; <hi>Heb. 2. 16. For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of</hi> Abraham; and his being Conceiv'd and Born of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> clearly proves that it was not a ſhadow, or likeneſs of Man that he took, but real Man; and in regard it is ſaid, that he took on him the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> And in the aforeſaid <hi>Hebrews 2. ver.</hi> 14. it is ſaid, <hi>As the children are made partakers of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the the ſame:</hi> Which clearly ſhews him to be God; for who elſe muſt this he be, who took on him the Seed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> and took on himſelf part of Fleſh and Blood? It muſt be ſome Being ſuperiour to the Angels themſelves; for the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it, as an Act of Soveraignty and Good Pleaſure in this Mighty He; in this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44508:20"/>
Almighty Being; who did not take the Nature of Angels, but did take the Seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> So my Accountant and I are agreed in this: That God the Son did take our Nature upon him: And in this Senſe. God was made Man; <hi>The Word was made fleſh.</hi> I ſuppoſe my Accountant will diſcover ſo much Reaſon, as to own that this He; the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of was not Man nor Angel: For then he had ſpoken Nonſence, and his Words would have run thus, verily an Angel or a Man, took not on him the Nature of Angels; but the Seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> So that it is Evident, this He, was neither Angel nor Man; but a being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſuperiour to both. But,</p>
            <p>My Author goes on to his <hi>7th.</hi> Reaſon, and ſaith, <hi>That there can be no Eſſential or Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and a Creature; Finite and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Infinite; For the being of God doth not require the being of a Creature to his being.</hi> A very unreaſonable aſſertion, and therefore muſt have ſome thing reaſonable joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it; to gull the ſimple and unwary Reader: <hi>There can be no Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion between God and a Creature</hi> he ſaith; and pray why ſo? why, becauſe <hi>the being of God, doth not require the being of a Creature to his being; or any thing but himſelf, to make up his Perſon or Self.</hi> This is a ſort of Logick, that the Gentleman may think, may down well enough with Mechanicks; and ſuch like ordinary Fellows: But it is ſtrange, the Doctors of Reaſon ſhould ſend ſuch ſtuff as this is abroad for ſound Reaſon; but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my Accountant, and his Brother the Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Author are Doctors of Reaſon; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44508:21"/>
perhaps they think, they have ingroſt all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into their own Hands; and if ſo, we muſt take what they will let us have, and at their own price too; or elſe one would think, they could not be ſo vain and Fooliſh as to tell us, there can be no Perſonal Union between God and a Creature. Surely, Almighty Power is able to take a Creature into Perſonal Union with himſelf, and as for that Nonſenſical pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reaſon, that the being of God does not require the being of a Creature to his being: What Senſe or Reaſon is there in it? If it had been neceſſary to his being, it muſt have been Eternal as God himſelf is; and then it could not be a Creature, for no Creature is Eternal; and then all the Condeſcention, Grace, and Love, that the Scripture ſpeaks of; in Gods taking our Nature upon him; muſt vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into Idle Tales, or be led Captive at the Heels of our Accountants fooliſh Reaſon: Pray try a little, how this Argument will look in other Caſes, the being of God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the being of any Creatures to make up his being, happineſs and bleſſedneſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot, or will not deſcend to the Work of Creation; and when they are all made, they cannot all of them add one Tittle to his Eſſential Glory: Therefore they were not made <hi>for, nor are</hi> to his Glory now made. Where is the wiſe Man? where is the Scribe? 1 <hi>Cor. 1 19, 20. God will deſtroy the wiſdom of the Wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtanding of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;</hi> according to that old threatning againſt the Wiſe Men of this World: <hi>Iſa. 29. 14. That wiſdom ſhould periſh from the wiſe, and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44508:21"/>
underſtanding of prudent Men ſhall be hid.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>I paſs on to his <hi>Eighth Reaſon,</hi> where I find our Accountant having paſt all bounds of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight Reaſon, will needs break thorow all bounds of Truth and Modeſty too; and therefore tells us, <hi>Whatever is ſaid of Chriſt in Scripture, is ſaid of him as Man.</hi> But, he preſently adds to cover this Story, <hi>That the ſhift ſo many uſe, of Chriſt ſpeaking ſo and ſo as God, and ſo and ſo as Man, is unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Fooliſh; and ſounds no better then this, that</hi> Peter <hi>as</hi> Peter <hi>denyed his Maſter; but</hi> Peter <hi>as</hi> John <hi>did not deny his Maſter.</hi> We look upon it as a prudential peice of Juſtice, to ſuſpect Common Lyars when they ſpeak Truth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope, our Accountant will not think it any diſhonour to him; If I do by him, as the Noble <hi>Bereans</hi> did by <hi>Paul;</hi> ſearch the Scriptures before I receive this aſſertion for Truth or ſound Reaſon: But upon a Second view of this <hi>Eighth Reaſon,</hi> I find there is not one Scripture mentioned, and therefore I may very honeſtly; retort his aſſertion back upon him again; and tell him, this aſſertion is very Fooliſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural: But if I can give no other Anſwer than this, I know my Accountant will out Reckon me by abundance; for he is a Man of Reaſon, and perhaps may be as ready to ſay to me concerning Reaſon, as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> did to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi> concerning the Spirit; and ask which way went Reaſon from him to me? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 23. But what faith the Scriptures in this Caſe? for by them my Author thinks to diſhonour our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with no leſs then Robbing him of his Divine Nature; <hi>Iſaiah 9. 9.

Now Sir, will you have the impudence, to give the Spirit of God the Lye in theſe two Scriptures; or will you ſuffer your Reaſon, to poſſeſs you with ſo much Madneſs and Folly; as to charge the Spirit of God with Folly, and ſay he ſpeaks Nonſence; chuſe you whither? But,</p>
            <p>Our Accountant goes on, and I am willing to follow him; being willing to find <hi>out the reaſon of a thing;</hi> and he tells us which he calls his <hi>Ninth Reaſon,</hi> Page <hi>4th. That tho' Chriſt be truly ſaid to be the Son of God, yet he is never in Scripture caelled God the Son.</hi> Now would I give you a Scripture, to prove that he is called God the Son; but you have told me already ſuch Scriptures are dark, but I cannot help that; they are Scriptures notwithſtanding, and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you ſpeak of, lyes in the weakneſs of your underſtanding; and the Folly of your pretended Reaſon. Beſides, the Scriptures were Written for this very purpoſe, to give Wiſdom to the ſimple; but thoſe that are Wiſe in their own conceit, may be ſent away as they came: For you know God himſelf tells us, <hi>that he ſends the rich empty away.</hi> Pray, Sir Read <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8. but unto the Son he ſaith, <hi>Thy Throne O God is for Ever,</hi> &amp;c. I think this is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44508:22"/>
not ſo dark a ſaying, but you may underſtand him to be called God the Son in thoſe Words; and admitting it were dark or hard, as thoſe ſaid, who told our Lord his ſayings were hard; when he ſpoke of giving them his Fleſh to eat: And no doubt, but they were as much above their underſtandings, and as contrary to their Reaſon; as the Doctrine of the Bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is above or againſt yours; yet were they the Words of Truth it ſelf for all that. And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, Prov. 1. 5, 6. <hi>A wiſe Man will hear and increaſe Learning:</hi> And for this Reaſon among others, <hi>to underſtand the Words of the Wiſe and their dark ſayings.</hi> But our Accountant, and his Brother the Nameleſs Author are Wiſe Men; whether it be in their own eyes or others, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that. Their Reaſon is the Touch-ſtone of Gods Truth, and therefore whatever God reveals, muſt Firſt come and make its acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to Mr. Licenſer General: our Authors Reaſon; and if it paſs Muſter in his Fooliſh Noddle, it may go for Truth; but if not, (as what reaſonable Man can think, that the Myſteries of God ſhould be comprehended by the Fooliſh, corrupted, unreaſonable, though pretended Reaſon of Man: Eſpecially, ſeeing the Carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God and the Scripture; yea, Reaſon it ſelf may inform us, that none knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God and he to whom he reveals him.) Why then it muſt paſs through the ſtrict In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the Doctor of Reaſons Queries? as, Firſt, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> Secondly, <hi>How can this Man give us his Fleſh to eat? Joh. 6. 52. Theſe are hard ſayings who can hear them;</hi> ver. 60.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44508:23"/>
               <hi>Or,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Thou art not yet fifty Years old, and haſt thou ſeen our Father</hi> Abraham? And if our Lord ſtand to it, and aſſert his Divine Nature by ſaying, <hi>before</hi> Abraham <hi>was I am;</hi> they will will be ready to Stone him for a Blaſphemer; becauſe they knew his Mother, and his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Father according to the Fleſh; therefore he cannot ſpeak the Truth, it will not paſs with Doctor <hi>Reaſon:</hi> Therefore, Gods Truth muſt be condemned for Folly and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe: But woe unto thoſe Men that will call evil good, or good evil; or truth error, or error truth; when God riſeth up to contend with thoſe Men, he will make them know, he is not ſuch a one as themſelves.</p>
            <p>But our Accountant after all his Pains to build a <hi>Babel's</hi> Tower, undermines it all at once in the winding up of his Reaſons: For he ſaith in his <hi>Tenth Reaſon,</hi> and his laſt but one; <hi>That the aſcribing the Divine Natures incommunicable Perfections, and worſhip to one and another; or a third Perſon or ſelf, neceſſarily infers a Plurality of Gods; and is a breach of the Firſt Commandment; hath many evil tendencies, and is the Ground of all the Idolatry,</hi> Antichriſtianiſm <hi>and</hi> Paganiſm.</p>
            <p>This is a high kick indeed, for here our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countant charges the Angels with Folly; and not only ſo, but all the bleſſed Company in Heaven; Nay, that is not all, but rather then not do his own buſineſs effectually, he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Judgment with God himſelf. Well, however <hi>B. R. S.</hi> or any under his care may ſlight him or his Book, as thinking neither worth Anſwering; yet I muſt needs ſay he is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44508:23"/>
a ſtout bold Fellow, for he dares to charge God himſelf with contradiction; and with being acceſſary to the Breach of his own firſt Command: For according to our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countants Reaſon, he ſuffers the Worſhip and Worſhippers in Heaven, to infer a Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods; and to lay a Foundation for all Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> and <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> For in <hi>Revelations</hi> 5. we have an Account of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Heaven; and in the 11, 12, 13. <hi>Verſes,</hi> we have an Account of the Angels, and the Beaſts and Elders giving <hi>Bleſſing, Honour, Glory and Power to him; that ſitteth upon the Throne and untothe Lamb for ever and ever,</hi> ver. 14. and the 4 beaſts ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to all this, and the 24 <hi>Elders fall down and Worſhip him that liveth for ever and ever:</hi> Here is Divine honour and Worſhip, Given to him that ſitteth on the Throne; and the ſame in the ſame breath, given unto another; to uſe my Authors own Words, <hi>Even to the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> And yet God doth not charge them with Idolatry, nor making to themſelves another God: No, this is the Worſhip of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and muſt continue ſo for ever and ever. Sure, if our Accountant had any good hope of Worſhipping with this bleſſed Company in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; he would endeavour to imitate them while here on Earth: A Man had need have a good Stock of Patience, as alſo of Faith and every Grace of the Holy Spirit; to live in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dependancy on him, that gives Wiſdom to ſuch ſimple Ones as he pleaſeth; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to as many of them as have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as ſeemeth good to Soveraign pleaſure; as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44508:24"/>
alſo humbly to remember, that the <hi>Oſtrich</hi> hideth her Eggs in the Sand, and forgetteth that the Wild Beaſt may cruſh them; becauſe God hath deprived her of Wiſdom: Or elſe a Man indu'd but with an Ordinary meaſure of Reaſon, and not Balaſt'd with the aforeſaid Graces of Gods Holy Spirit; could not forbear the reſenting this unreaſonable aſſertion, ſo as to give my Accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Character, much below that of Maſter of Reaſon: But I may not give ill Language, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſo Learned Chriſt. Neither is it fit for a Man of a mean capacity, to ſay to ſuch a Learned Gentleman thou <hi>art a blockhead;</hi> nor ſhall I ſay any thing of the Impudency that there is, in bringing in an Impeachment and Charge of the higheſt Treaſon and Idolatry; that Can be againſt the whole Court of Heaven, the Bleſſed Him that ſitteth upon the Throne and the Lamb (who is worthy of all bleſſing, Honour, Power and Glory;) not being exempted: This is ſuch a peice of Fool hardineſs, as none but thoſe that dare Run, upon the thick boſſes of Gods Buckler can be guilty of. I hope, our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countant will not diſcover ſo much Folly; as to attempt to excuſe himſelf of an error in this, by Quoting 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 20. Where it is ſaid, <hi>All the Congregation bleſſed the Lord God of their Fathers, and bowing their heads Worſhipped the Lord and the King.</hi> That being but an External or Civil Worſhip, which the People paid to the King; or that is due from Inferiours to Superiours: And our Accountant himſelf tells me, he could not bear the aſcribing the ſame Glory to Chriſt in Prayer, which is due to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44508:24"/>
Father; whereby he publickly enters his diſſent and proteſt againſt the Worſhip and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, and Worſhipped alſo in Heaven: For the Truth is, what ever Worſhip Kings and ſuch may receive from their Subjects in this World; yet there never was, nor ſhall be any King, Lord, or Potentate; that ſhall receive Honour, Glory Bleſſing and Praiſe from all the Worſhippers both Angels and Men, that are in Heaven for ever and ever; but he who is the only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, Jeſus Chriſt who is the true God and Eternal Life; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. It is ſtrange, that there ſhould not be one Doctor of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among all this Bleſſed Company; to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Athaliah</hi> in crying out, Treaſon, Treaſon, Idolatry, Idolatry, contradiction, Nonſence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the right Heir is Crowned, and receives the Glory of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But upon Second thoughts, it will not appear ſo ſtrange as true; for God hath not choſen many wiſe Men of this world, and thoſe few that are choſen from among them, muſt firſt become Fools that they may be truly Wiſe; For God hath choſen the Fooliſh things of this World to confound the wiſe; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 20, 27, to the end. Thus we ſee the Scriptures made good, <hi>The wiſdom of this World is Fooliſhneſs with God:</hi> For it is Written he taketh the Wiſe in their own Craftineſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>There is yet another thing, which our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countant will needs call his Eleventh <hi>Reaſon;</hi> or Stone in this <hi>Babel</hi> Building and his laſt: But whether it may be called his Top Stone
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44508:25"/>
or Bottom? no matter for that, ſuch as it is take it word for word, Page <hi>5th. that it is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Great folly and boldneſs, to affirm any thing Concerning God; which is unreaſonable or abſurd, yea, which we do not underſtand to be true:</hi> Surely, what ever miſtakes and Errors the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> may be guilty of, yet it is certain they cannot be guilty of greater; not indeed, ſo great Boldneſs and Folly as our Accountant is; as we have ſeen but now in his laſt Argument. For I do not find that they enter into Judgment with God, nor charge the moſt high fooliſhly, nor with folly; and I pray <hi>Sir,</hi> upon ſecond thoughts tell me, which is the greateſt Folly and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to believe what God declares of himſelf, to be reaſonable and true, though we do not underſtand it; or to give God the Lye, and and tell him that what he declares of himſelf is falſe, unreaſonable, and abſurd; becauſe we do not underſtand it; Such an Anſwer as this from a Servant to a Maſter, would be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Impudent boldneſs, and we ſee there is nothing more common among Men, whoſe Underſtandings and Reaſon differ greatly yet, far enough are they from differing infinitely; yet among Men, it is no new thing for the Wiſe and Learned, to underſtand and know that to be true and Reaſonable; which the more Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant are rather more ready to wonder at, than they are able to give a Demonſtration of; Yet are theſe Gentlemen ſo confident in their own Reaſon, that they will give the Lye to God himſelf; if he tell them the Father, the Word, and Holy Ghoſt are One: So care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44508:25"/>
are theſe Gentlemen, that their Faith may not ſtand in the Power of God but in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Men. But whether it be right in the ſight of God, to believe or obey Men rather than God? judge ye; <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 19. I have now done with my ſhort Accountant, the reſt of his Book being meerly Hiſtorical, of what did paſs between him and <hi>B. R. S.</hi> and the Church of which he was a Member; but I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with that, my Buſineſs being only to contend for that Faith; which was once delivered to the Saints, and to believe the Truth as it is in Jeſus: I ſhall therefore now, take a view of our Nameleſs Author again; and ſee if he can produce any ſound Reaſon, to perſwade us to deny our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For I take it for granted, that it is as great a denial of him to deny him to be as he is, <hi>God over all bleſſed for ever more;</hi> as it is to deny him to be our redemer: For indeed the Holy One of <hi>Iſarel</hi> is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer thereof.</p>
            <p>But on a Second view of our Author in his <hi>Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity aſſerted;</hi> I do not find any other Reaſons, than what I have already conſidered, and find in my Accountant, ſave only he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what larger; and in his <hi>10th. page Colume</hi> 1. he would deny the Divinity of our Lord, and prove it too if he didbut know how; from this Argument, that Man is made after God's own Image. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>If God be a Trinity and Man be his Image, we may find an Image of that Trinity in our ſelves:</hi> But he excludes the Body from any part of this Image, which may look tolerable enough at firſt view becauſe God is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44508:26"/>
a Spirit; and if he had ſtopt here, he might have carried his Sophiſtry off pretty fair; but the Wits of our day muſt over ſhoot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: He tells you the Reaſon why the Body is excluded, becauſe ſaith he, <hi>It is imperfect; and there is no Imperfection with God:</hi> Good Sir, did you expect to find the Soul of Man a perfect Image of God, when you firſt entred on this Argument; really you might well have ſpared your Pains here, and have given the Spirit of God the Lye once more; and you ſhould have as good Reaſon ſo to do, as you have to give our Lord himſelf the Lye, as you do in your <hi>15th. page colume</hi> 2. where you ſay, <hi>The ſame worſhip which is due to the Father, is not to be given to Chriſt; but that which may be given to a Creature for God's ſake.</hi> Wherein you do in plain Engliſh give Truth it ſelf the Lye; for he hth told us, that all <hi>Men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father;</hi> as hath been already proved by Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 5. 23. and by the Example of the Worſhippers in Heaven: But if you had been ſincerely looking, for a faint Reſemblance of the Image of God in Man as a Trinity; to ſay nothing of that Moral Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that God at firſt ſtampt on Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of himſelf, which conſiſted in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true Holineſs; which indeed was the greateſt Reſemblance in Man to God; And yet we have reaſon to believe, that the Angels were every whit as much like God, as in this ſenſe Man was. Therefore it muſt be ſomething elſe in the make of Man, that did bear ſome Image of God; for which cauſe it is ſaid, he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44508:26"/>
made Man in his own Image; and if you had not wilfully ſhut your Eyes you could not but ſee, that the Scripture ſpeaks of Body, Soul, and Spirit in Man; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> prays for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 23. that <hi>They might be ſanctified throughout in Body, Soul and Spirit.</hi> And if there be ſuch a thing as Body, Soul and Spirit in Man, then here is ſome faint Reſemblance in Man of a Trinity in God. I ſay a faint Reſemblance, for I am not ſo void of Reaſon; as to think that a finite weak Man can be a perfect Image of God. Yet our Author, to ſhew what a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Wit he hath; ſpends all his <hi>10th.</hi> page both <hi>columes,</hi> and part of <hi>11th.</hi> to prove that which no Body denies; or that which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the purpoſe: But in his <hi>11th.</hi> page his Wit runs over, and his Invention will run too faſt for his Reaſon do what he can; for he ſaith, <hi>That cannot be called Generation or Origination, which never began to be generated or originated;</hi> and if he had ſtopp'd here, he might have danc'd in the Dark; and they that have no Eyes could never have ſeen him: But the Gentleman's Invention hangs in the Light of his Reaſon. He tells us the Reaſon is, <hi>That which never began to be a doing was never done; and therefore</hi> ETERNAL GENERATION <hi>muſt be</hi> ETERNAL NONSENCE. Well argued moſt Learned Doctor, a Man would be ready to think you were a Penſioner to <hi>Hobbs,</hi> to make way for, and gain Proſelytes to his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan:</hi> For by this Argument, that which never began to be cannot have a Being; and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44508:27"/>
then the Fool may ask us, <hi>Where is your God?</hi> and the Truth is, the Attribute of God's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is as much above, and out of your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the Doctrine of the Trinity; and if you tell me there is a difference between a Being and an Act.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, that an Eternal Act is as much without a Beginning, as an Eternal Being; and it is equally as great a piece of Nonſence, and as derogatory to the Glory of God, to ſay God was before he acted; as to ſay he acted before he was. Really Gentlemen, but only for the great Names and Titles, by which you are pleaſed to dignifie, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh your ſelves from the common People; ſuch as Maſters of Reaſon, Learning, Scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the like; or elſe a Man may find more ſound Reaſon, among a few Men of the meaneſt Employments and meaneſt Capacities; than in an whole Conclave of ſuch Doctors as you are. For I pray you Sir, tell me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Heat and Prejudice; and with ſolid ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reaſon, what a kind of ſenſeleſs, lifeleſs ſomething worſe than nothing, muſt you ſnp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God to be; if you could ſuppoſe him to be without, or before he acted: Hath your great Learning ſpoiled your Memory ſo much, as to make you forget that common Maxim, that where there is Life there is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sure, that Cauſe muſt be very deſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately defective and unreaſonably bad, that neceſſarily runs Men upon Atheiſm or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe; and ſo much the worſe, becauſe they pretend to plead for Reaſon all that while.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44508:27"/>
Nay, the Conſiderator in his Letter to <hi>H. H.</hi> is ſo confident, but fooliſh enough (God knows) as to tell the World; they were always too hard for the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> at theſe two Weapons <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture.</hi> But hitherto we have found them too ſhort in their ſound Reaſoning, we ſhall try what ſtrength they have by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in due place.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it may not be an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Work, to enquire what true Reaſon is; that we may not be as Men beating the Air, crying out great is Humane Reaſon; and at the ſame time ſcarce know what true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is. And if the Doctors of Reaſon would not be offended, I would tell them what I take it to be. It is a good Gift of God, which he is pleaſed to beſtow in ſome meaſure on moſt of the Children of Men; whereby we are enabled to diſcern the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion or Dependancy, that one thing hath upon another.</p>
            <p>Hence it follows, that Knowledge is not Reaſon, neither can Reaſon work without knowledge; any more than a Man can walk in the Air, or a Carpenter can build a Houſe without a Foundation. Hence it follows, that the greateſt Scholars are not always the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Men; as one of their own hath lately told us, as good, and as great a one perhaps as any this day living: Saith he, <q>There are a great many Scholars, who are carried only by their Books.</q> They know much and therefore can tell a great deal; as you know every Fool can tell as he is told: But for matter of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44508:28"/>
ſound Reaſon, whereby they are inabled to draw, juſt and Reaſonable concluſions from known and certain Premiſes; If it be never ſo little out of their Book Road; and for which they have not as yet, conſulted an Author. Truly, a Man may let a great many of theſe Gentlemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; hence it comes to paſs, for we are now diſcourſing about Reaſon; it is a power of drawing juſt and right concluſions from known and certain Premiſes: Hence it is that though Learning is in it ſelf, a very great, and very good Gift of God, and a great accompliſhment to a Man; and therefore to be highly prized by them that have it, and to be honoured by them that have it not: Yet great Scholarſhip, cannot deliver ſome Men from being great Blockheads; for Soveraign Pleaſure will beſtow his Gifts to whom, and how he pleaſeth; to one a Word of Wiſdom, to another the Word of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by the ſame Spirit; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. How prepoſteriouſly then do thoſe Gentlemen go to Work, that would Meaſure the being and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the infinite God, by their weak and imperfect Reaſon; of which there are as many degrees it may be, as there are Men in the World; and which can no more Work of it ſelf, without ſome Knowledge to Work upon; then an Artiſt can Work without Tools, or Matter to Work upon. And it is impoſſible for Man to have any ſaving Knowledge of God, but by Revelation; and there are but three Ways, that ever God revealed himſelf by to Men; they are his Works, his Word, and by his Holy Spirit; and it is not our Reaſon, as it is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44508:28"/>
a Faculty or Power in us now corrupted; that can gather any true or ſaving Knowledge of God, as he is in himſelf or will be to us, from his Works of Creation and Providence: No, nor from his Word neither, without the Aid of his Holy Spirit; and that in an eſpecial manner: We ſee this by the Heathen, who were as great Maſters of Reaſon, as any of our preſent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders; and yet were far enough from a true Knowledge of God; and how could they, for who knows the Mind of God, much leſs the Nature, but the Spirit of God; and he to whom he reveals him: But let us conſider, the Knowledge that God gives us of himſelf by Creation, and ſee what improvements Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can make of it; we ſee a viſible World, and therefore by the Apoſtles Argument in <hi>Romans</hi> 1. 19. 20. we may conclude, that there was ſome being, that gave being to thoſe Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Changeable things; and that this being muſt be, before all thoſe things that do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; elſe he could not give them being: Thus arguing by Reaſon, from the Effects to the Cauſe; we riſe from the Men now in being, to the firſt Man that was Made; and ſo likewiſe of all other Created beings, to the firſt of them: And ſo likewiſe of the Heavens and the Earth, and all that therein is; whoſe very being declare they had a Maker, who is God; for he that Maketh all things is God.</p>
            <p>Hence we may Reaſonably conclude, that this God is an Almighty Infinitely Wiſe God; yea, that he is a Merciful God, for his Mercy is Written in viſible Characters over all his viſible
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44508:29"/>
Works; and yet it muſt be acknowledged, that all the Reaſon that the greateſt Doctors of it ever had; could never gather any Reaſonable hope of the Pardon of their Sin, or of Eternal Life; by the Revelation that God hath made of himſelf by the Works of Creation and Providence. If you tell me, you may hope for Mercy, becauſe you are the Works of his hands; his Mercy being over all his Works. I Anſwer, the Devils may as Reaſonably hope for Mercy as you, or I, upon this Account; for they are Creatures, and ſo are we; and they are Sinners and ſo are we. So that there is a neceſſity for God, to reveal himſelf to us by ſome more Clearer Light, then that of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if you and I, ever come to a true and ſaving Knowledge of him; this neceſſarily leads us to conſider, what Revelation God makes of himſelf in his Word. But,</p>
            <p>Before I come to Conſider that I would a little inquire, what further improvements Reaſon can make of the Work of Creation to find out God; and Counting things One by One, to find out the Account as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; we may come to know that God is an Eternal being, without beginning of days, or end of time; and it is neceſſary he ſhould be ſo, elſe he could not give being to all other beings; neither could ſuch an Infinite being ariſe, or ſpring out of nothing; but he is a Self Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient All-ſufficient being without beginning. Now though Reaſon, rightly Arguing from the Effects to the Cauſe; may find out the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power and God-head (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44508:29"/>
that is know; that God is an Eternal being: Yet all the Doctors of Reaſon, can never ſhew how it can be ſo; any more than they can ſhew how the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt can be One God: And I do hereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, (not to trouble the Learned about ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſiblities as either of theſe are;) that on the ſame Day in the Morning, of which our Doctors of Reaſon, ſhall give me a reaſonable Demonſtration; how a being can be without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beginning: I will, in the Afternoon of that ſame day before the Sun goes down, give them as Reaſonable a Demonſtration; how the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt are one God. For when you have Magnified your Reaſon, as far as you will or can, you have but two ways to Work it by; either you muſt argue from the Cauſe to the Effect, or from the Effect to the Cauſe; Not from the Cauſe to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for the very Suppoſition of a Cauſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Nature of a Being without a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; nor can you find it out, by arguing from the Effect to the Cauſe; for where there is no Cauſe all Effects muſt ceaſe. So that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very Rational, both againſt you that will not believe God to be as he is; becauſe your Reaſon cannot comprehend him: Whereas if you could, he muſt ceaſe to be God; for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and Eternal Being, cannot be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by a Finite, Fooliſh Man; As alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the greater Atheiſt, who deny the being of God; becauſe they ſay, there can be no being without a Beginning; but that God is, all his wondrous Works decl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re; for there
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44508:30"/>
could be no Effects, If there were not a firſt Cauſe to Produce thoſe Effects; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt be without a Cauſe, or elſe he muſt be but an Effect of ſome other Cauſe; and that deſtroys his Eternal Power and Godhead. So that as the Works of God do clearly ſhew that he is, and that he is and Eternal Being; yet all the Reaſon in Man by the utmoſt ſearching, can never find out the Almighty ſo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; as to give a Demonſtration how he can be ſo. So that, however theſe Gentlemen of Reaſon cry out againſt Miſteries; yet this one Attribute of Gods Eternity is ſuch a Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as all the Worſhippers in Heaven both Angels and Men, ſhall adore and admire God for; as well as for his other excellencies and perfections, even to Eternity. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that in <hi>Rev. 4. ver.</hi> 8. There the four Beaſts that ſtood round about the Throne adore God for his Eternity; <hi>and they reſt not day and night, ſaing, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty; which was, and is, and is to come,</hi> thoſe Bleſſed Creatures adore and believe, what they could not give a Reaſon for; and for that very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they admire, and adore God ſo much the more: Whereas if they could have told how God was, they would have declared it; and not <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> like, have kept back any part of their knowledge. For we find in all their Thankſgivings, they go as far as they can; in <hi>Rev. 5. ver.</hi> 9. in their new Song which they Sing, they ſay; the Lamb is worthy to take the Book, and open the Seals thereof; and when they Praiſe him for Redeeming them, and making them Kings and Prieſts; they reſt not there,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44508:30"/>
but go as far as they can, even to the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all; ſaying, who hath Loved us and waſhed us in his blood; and thereby made us Kings, and Prieſts unto our God: Where by the way we may obſerve, that all Gods Kings and Prieſts are made ſo, by being waſhed in Chriſt Blood; and not by their imperfect following Chriſt Example, of which more in due place.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, let our Men of Reaſon make never ſo much Noiſe and Clamor, againſt the Doctrine of the Trinity, as being contrary to Reaſon and after they have darkned Counſel; by Multitudes of Words without Knowledge, yet it is evident, that all their Reaſons, may be reduced to one which lyes with equal force againſt the very being of God; that is, their Reaſon cannot comprehend how three can be One: And I will for once venture to aſſert, not knowing any Law nor Reaſon againſt it; that their Reaſon can as little comprehend and their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is as much at a Loſs, to know how a being can be without a beginning: So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their pretentions to Chriſtianity, they are but Factors to Atheiſm; for if the Atheiſt can but prove, that every Mans Reaſon is his ſufficient Rule for what he ought to believe; and Practice, he will gain a great Point; and the greateſt Fools will never want Arguments, to juſtifie their Fooliſh Notions and Practices. For if the worſt of Fools, (an Atheiſt) come and ſay, there is no God; he will pretend Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it: Though it be the moſt irrational thing, that a Reaſonable being can be guilty of; For there can be no beings that we ſee, but either made themſelves or were produced by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44508:31"/>
ſome other Cauſe or ſprang out of nothing; or elſe it is Eternal without beginning or Cauſe: Surely, we our Selves did not make our Selves, nor could ſomething of it ſelf, ſpring out of nothing; much leſs could nothing, produce ſomthing: Therefore the Heavens and the Earth, could not make themſelves; neither could ſuch a Fabrick of it ſelf, ariſe out of nothing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt have a Creator, that by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, could ſpeak things into being; without matter to Work upon: Or elſe the Heavens and the Earth muſt be Eternal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Beginning or Cauſe; and then they yield their Argument, and contradict themſelves. If they ſay, the Heavens and the Earth, did by Chance jumble into the order in which they now are, out of a confus'd Chaos of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pre exiſtant to the Heavens and the Earth; (to ſay nothing of the ſtrangeneſs that it ſhould not jumble back again, into the ſame Confus'd Chaos; by the ſame Chance before this time of day.) I Demand, how this confus'd Chaos, or diſorderly matter came into being; out of which this Heaven and Earth, Chopt into into ſuch an orderly Frame? If they tell me that this confus'd matter was Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That this is ſo ſottiſh and blockiſh, that none but Madmen or Fools can be guilty of it; for who but thoſe that have no reaſon, or having had it have now loſt it, will deny an Infinite, Eternal Being; and yet attribute theſe Perfections to nothing, or confuſed Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44508:31"/>
which is worſe than nothing. But theſe are not the Fools I am concerned with, I am treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Gentlemen; a Title too good, and too great for the greateſt Atheiſt in the World, however they may aſſume it to themſelves; or their flattering Trencher dependants may as treacherouſly, as well as cowardly give it unto them. But the Gentlemen I am concerned with, are Men of Reaſon; only their great Learning hath ſo ſtuft their Heads and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, that they have almoſt forgot what ſound Reaſon is; as hath been already ſeen, in examining the Stuff they call Reaſon. It is to be lamented, that one good Gift of God ſhould fall upon ſuch bad Ground, as to drive out another; but ſo it is, what elſe is the meaning of that Word, <hi>Let not the Wiſe Man glory in his Wiſdom, nor the Rich Man glory in his Riches,</hi> &amp;c. But to ſhew, that as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in theſe things, robs the Giver of his Due, ſo it makes the Receiver become a poor, weak Fool, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 23. And indeed, it is very unreaſonable to think it can be otherwiſe, for if every good and perfect Gift comes down from the Father of Lights; and is diſpenſed to us through the Son, by the Holy Spirit; what can thoſe Gentlemen do otherwiſe, but diſcover themſelves to be as they are; who ſhall deny our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be as he is; over all, God bleſſed for evermore; and thereby deny to live by Faith upon him, and as much as in them lies, cut themſelves off from him, in whom dwelleth the Fulneſs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44508:32"/>
of the Godhead. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. But if Reaſon fail, theſe Gentlemen ſay they will remove the Cauſe to the Scriptures of Truth; moſt gladly therefore with them to the Scriptures I will go, and guide and ſubject my Reaſon thereunto: And indeed, it is impoſſible for us to have a true Knowledge of God; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Revelation that he gives of himſelf, by his Word and Spirit.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take Notice, of the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh as well as ſlanderous Report; that my name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Author (in his <hi>Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity aſſerted,</hi> pag. 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. as well as the Conſiderator in his <hi>19th.</hi> and <hi>20th.</hi> pages of his Anſwer to the Biſhop of <hi>Sarum)</hi> gives to the Chriſtian Divines; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That were it not for Church Awes, and for fear of loſing their Stipends; they would deny the Doctrine of the Trinity themſelves.</hi> I thank God, I lye under no Temptation of being byaſs'd by the Churches Smiles or Frowns; I being no Clergy-Man, nor the Son of a Clergy-Man; and therefore my Judgment cannot be bribed with the hope oſ getting, or fear of loſing any Benefice. But God having given me an Immortal Soul, it becomes me, and it is but my reaſonable Duty as well as Intereſt, to be as much concerned about the Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof; as any of thoſe whoſe Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is, being called of God as <hi>Aaron</hi> to ſerve at the Altar; by preaching the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Riches of Chriſt, and the great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel and Godlineſs, <hi>God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh;</hi> Eph. 3. 8. 1 Tim. 3. 16. And here I muſt take leave to tell our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44508:32"/>
of Reaſon, that if the Scriptures tell me, that Jeſus Chriſt is the true God and Eternal Life as I find it doth; 1 <hi>John 5. 20. Tit.</hi> 2. 13. I muſt therefore believe this Truth, becauſe I find it Teſtified in the Scriptures of Truth; although thereby I ſhould practically give thoſe Gentlemen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Lye, who ſay he is but a Man; and although to prove their Sayings they tell me, their great Reaſon and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath taught them ſo to ſay and believe; therefore to do them right, I do freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they have a juſt right, to lay claim to the Title that the Apoſtle gives to thoſe ſimple Gentlemen; ſpoken of in the 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 7. Who were ever learning, and never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> And yet it is evident, that theſe were no ſmall Fools in their own Conceit; for in the next Verſe, the Apoſtle compares them to <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres;</hi> whoſe Ignorance and Folly was over-laid with ſuch a ſtock of Impudence, that they had Confidence enough to reſiſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> though he was one of the greateſt Men that ever lived upon the Earth. And there were ſuch pretended Wits in the Apoſtles days, Men of corrupt Minds reſiſting the Truth, concerning the Faith reprobate: But their Folly was made manifeſt, as the Unreaſonableneſs of our pretended Men of Reaſon at this day is. But let us ſee, how theſe Men reconcile Scripture to their Reaſon, or rather pervert it; for my Author in his <hi>16th.</hi> page, <hi>colume</hi> 1. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues; that becauſe we are to love God with all our Hearts, therefore the Son is not God;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44508:33"/>
for then our Love would be divided. Which argues ſtrongly that he is God, becauſe we are commanded to love and honour him as the Father; as hath been proved by Scripture Command, and the Example of the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in Heaven: And alſo is an undeniable Argument, that the Father and the Son are one; whether my Author will receive it, or can underſtand it or no.</p>
            <p>The next Scripture that I find Our Author mentions in particular, after he had mentioned ſeveral to prove God is one; which ſignifies no more to his Cauſe, then if a Man pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove, there is no Night in our Climate; ſhould tell us when we ſee the Sun ſhine we may be ſure it is day: For all true Chriſtians believe God is one, and that the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, is this One God. But the Text which he mentions and recites at Large, is in his <hi>18th. Page.</hi> 1 Colume; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>who being in the Form of God, thought it not Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God; but made himſelf of no Reputation, and took one him the Form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:</hi> My Author ſaith, (the reconciling Senſe is, that is, to there Fooliſh Reaſon) that he thought of no ſuch Robbery, as being equal with God: It is very ſtrange, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould ſo much excel the Maſter; when the Devil himſelf, transformed himſelf into an Angel of Light; he did not Quote Scripture ſo Falſly, nor pervert it ſo palpably as this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to; when he Brought Scripture to Tempt our Lord, to caſt himſelf down from the Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44508:33"/>
of the Temple; as any Chriſtian may, ſee by comparing the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>6th.</hi> with the <hi>91ſt. Pſal. ver.</hi> 11. But Let us Conſider, what the Holy Ghoſt was preſſing on Chriſtians in the Context; that we may not Charge him with Contradiction and Nonſence, how bold ſo ever we may be with his Diſciples; and here we find he ſpeaks of ſome Perſon or being, that was in the Form of God; and therefore the other aſſertion, that he thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, was a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſequence of the Former; and to take it as my Author doth, is but to give the Lye to the Holy Ghoſt, or to Charge him with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; let him chooſe whether: Beſides, the <hi>7th.</hi> and <hi>8th.</hi> verſes make it clear, that the Apoſtle was ſpeaking of ſome Perſon or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſtinct and infinitely ſuperiour to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; and therefore ſpeaks of his Condeſcenſion, in taking on him the Form of a Servant, and being found in the Faſhion of a Man. Whereas were this this He the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of, no other but a Man; the Apoſtle had contradicted himſelf, and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument would have been meer Nonſence, and would have run thus; a Man humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and took on him the form and faſhion of a Man. Beſides, it is a Contradiction in the Nature of the thing it ſelf; and is no better Sence than to ſay, a Man made himſelf a Man: It may ſeem ſtrange, that Men ſhould be ſo blind; but how can it be otherwiſe, when they will needs war againſt him who is the Light and Life of Men. I always thought
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44508:34"/>
that my Author was endu'd with a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtock of Learning; only it look'd like a Jewel ſet in Lead, for want of ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to manage it; until I met with his reconciling Faculty, in his aforeſaid <hi>18th.</hi> page; and that brought to my Mind what the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15, 16. where ſpeaking of ſome of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles, of which this to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> and that to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are ſome: He ſaith, <hi>There are ſome things hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which the unlearned and unſtable wreſt, as they do alſo other Scriptures to their own Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> And when I read theſe things, I cannot for my Life, forbear thinking on my Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Author: For, beſides the flat Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he gives the Holy Ghoſt, it is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scope of the Apoſtle; which was to move them to Humility, and Condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion one to another from Chriſt's Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: But if he were a Man only, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Nonſence that there is, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man humbled himſelf to become a Man; the Man Jeſus, conſidered as a Man only; was highly honoured in his being conceived, and brought forth of a Virgin in ſuch a Miracn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Manner. So that conſider the Text which way you will, either with reſpect to the Words themſelves, or with reſpect to the Context; we are bound to believe the Truth as it is revealed; that <hi>He thought it no Robbery to be equal with God.</hi> There is nothing more material in my Author, which I have not taken Notice of, and ſhewed how unreaſonable it is; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44508:34"/>
where he pretends Scripture for his cunningly deviſed Fables. And the Truth is, thoſe Gentlemen would make much ſurer Work in their <hi>Babel</hi> Building; if they could but race out the Scriptures from among us; than ever they will be able to do by wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them one by one, to ſpeak according to their fooliſh Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>Conſiderator,</hi> in his Anſwer to his Grace the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> bids fair for it; for though he had tryed in vain by falſe and abſurd Gloſſes, to make the firſt Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> and many other Texts mentioned by his Lordſhip; to ſpeak according to his own, and his Maſter <hi>Socinus</hi> his fooliſh Reaſon; or rather corrupt Mind: Yet he flies at firſt to his beſt ſhift, though for Subtilty ſake ſomewhat indirectly; to except againſt the Goſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> the three Epiſtles and the <hi>Revelations;</hi> and would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon us, that they were counterfeited by one <hi>Cerinthus</hi> in <hi>John</hi>'s Name: And therein he hath not only ſecur'd his own Cauſe, but greatly oblig'd the Papiſts; a piece of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they never had the Impudence to attempt, though they kept them lock'd up in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue. Yes, but the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> tells us, that the Revelations of St. <hi>John</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and writ againſt by ſome of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> as being no part of Divine Writ. Well, be it ſo, every Body knows for what Cauſe, we have it recorded in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 10. becauſe they were not able to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt that ſpeaks therein; and at the ſame time others
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44508:35"/>
of them, are ſtriving with all the might they have, to ward off the Blow that the Spirit gives to that Intereſt; in wreſting it to any ſence, that may ſecure their Popiſh and Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Cauſe.</p>
            <p>In like manner doth the <hi>Conſiderator,</hi> not only with the <hi>Revelations,</hi> but with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of St. <hi>John</hi> and his three Epiſtles, and ſcarce any Text that is urg'd againſt them; but they ſay either it is not right tranſlated, or it is no Scripture; or elſe they manifeſtly wreſt it from the plain Sence and Meaning of the Holy Ghoſt. There in one Inſtance among many we have in the Goſpel of <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 8. v. 58. where our Lord ſaith, <hi>Before Abraham was I am;</hi> Conſiderator, <hi>pag. 57. co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume</hi> 1. that is ſaith he, <hi>In the Decree and Counſel of God:</hi> Why, good Mr. <hi>Conſiderator,</hi> what a great Secret have you found out now; are not all God's Works known to him from Eternity, were not you and I, and all the Men that ſhall be in the World to the end thereof, in the Counſel and Decree of God from Eternity? Surely, God is not like Man; to determine and purpoſe one thing yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and another to day.</p>
            <p>But pray Sir, be pleaſed to take a View of your own Learned Countenance; in your <hi>6th.</hi> page <hi>colume 1ſt.</hi> and <hi>2d.</hi> There you give ſeveral Arguments, to prove a thing cannot be poſſeſs'd before it is in being; and in particular you inſtance the Day of Judgment, which is not yet come; and therefore not poſſeſs'd. I hope you will not ſay it is not, or that it was not in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44508:35"/>
Decree of God; when and before he made the World: Therefore your Saying after <hi>Grotius,</hi> that a Man deſcending from <hi>Abraham;</hi> could not be any otherwiſe before <hi>Abraham,</hi> than in Divine Purpoſe and Decree; is very true and turns the Argument againſt you: Beſides, <hi>Abraham</hi> was in the Decree of God as ſoon as any Man. Therefore you muſt own, that our Lord did exiſt before he was born of the Virgin, or that he ſpoke Nonſence; for they themſelves knew, that the Decrees of God were Eternal; and our Lord had not given them an Anſwer to their Queſtion, which was whether he had ſeen <hi>Abraham,</hi> he being not fifty years old? Beſides, our Lord had told a plain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Lye; if he had ſaid he was in the Decree of God before <hi>Abraham:</hi> For <hi>Abraham</hi> was in God's Decree as ſoon as <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore no Man deſcending from <hi>Abraham,</hi> could be in God's Decree before him.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> goes a little further, and ſaith, our Lord did exiſt in the Promiſe of God before <hi>Abraham;</hi> which is very true alſo, for he was promiſed the ſame day of the Fall; but neither will this do the Buſineſs, nor diſcharge our <hi>Conſiderator</hi> from charging our Lord with Folly or Nonſence, or both: For it was promiſed preſently after the Flood, long before <hi>Abraham;</hi> that God ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>Japhet</hi> to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem,</hi> and yet the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the Seed of <hi>Japhet</hi> did not receive the Goſpel, till ſince our Lord's coming in the Fleſh. So likewiſe was it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of <hi>Joſiah</hi> an hundred years before he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44508:36"/>
was born; could he therefore ſay before I was born I am? Nay, is not Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> himſelf, and the reſt of his Learned Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren propheſied of by Name? in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. where the Holy Ghoſt tells us, there ſhall be falſe Teachers among Chriſtians; who privily ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies, denying the Lord that bought them; and bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſwift Deſtruction. Will you add ſo much Pride to your Folly, as to ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf as our Lord did? that becauſe I was in the Decree of God and propheſied of, therefore 1600 Years before born I am: Beſides, <hi>I Am,</hi> is a peculiar Title to God, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying his Self-exiſtence and Self-ſufficiency; which no created Being can take to himſelf without Blaſphemy. Well, but after all, the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> is reſolved to be a good Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for a bad Cauſe; who will looſe his Ground Inch by Inch: And therefore, he ſaith in his <hi>57th.</hi> page; <hi>firſt</hi> colume, <hi>That notwithſtanding all this, we muſt be Socinians or Arrians; for Chriſtians we may not be.</hi> No, by no means! if the Conſiderator can but jump in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the infallible Chair, and preſcribe a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for us. Thus it is, and thus it will be; as the truly Rational and Learned, as well as Pious Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> hath obſerved; <q>Truth will not pleaſe, the Devil will ſubſcribe to any Creed, but that which God gives of himſelf in his Word.</q> But, good Sir, why muſt we be <hi>Arrians?</hi> Why, becauſe Chriſt though he did exiſt before the World was made, yet he was but a Creature for all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44508:36"/>
that; but the firſt that ever God made: But neither will this ſhift, enable you to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Chriſtian Religion; nor ſhall you thereby, rob the Author of it of his Divine Nature; who is the great God and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us: <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 13, 14. For hereby you do but tread in your old Steps; by reſiſting and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the Holy Ghoſt as your Predeceſſors did in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. For in <hi>Revelation</hi> 1. the <hi>8th.</hi> and <hi>11th.</hi> Verſes our Lord ſaith, he is the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt:</hi> And to put the Matter out of Doubt, that it is Jeſus Chriſt there ſpeaks; the <hi>12th.</hi> Verſe to the End of the Chapter makes it evident, he being in the Likeneſs of the Son of Man. And in the <hi>17th.</hi> Verſe, he ſaith again, <hi>I am the firſt and the laſt:</hi> And in the <hi>18th. I am he that was dead and am alive:</hi> All which ſhews that this was Jeſus Chriſt, and that this Jeſus Chriſt is Godman; for he being the firſt, God the Father was not before him, then he could not be firſt; and he being the laſt End of all things; all things muſt end and terminate in his Glory: For God's Glory is the higheſt and chiefeſt Good, and therefore muſt be the ultimate and laſt End of all things; and that this was no other than Jeſus Chriſt, is evident in that he ſaith, <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead.</hi> Surely, God cannot dye, therefore this muſt be that mighty Child that was given to us, who alſo was the everlaſting Father; ſpoken of in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44; 6. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. Godman, God with us in our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44508:37"/>
Nature. And therefore he may well be called wonderful, becauſe he is Godman in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; God he muſt be, elſe he could not be the firſt nor laſt neither; for God only is the laſt End, as well as the firſt Cauſe of all things. Man he muſt be, elſe he could not dye; and God he muſt be, elſe he could not have power to raiſe himſelf again, as he tells you he had; <hi>John 10. 18. No man taketh it from me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but I lay it down of my ſelf; and I have power to take it up again:</hi> And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the next Verſe, together with <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 24. proves the Father and him to be one; as he ſaith of himſelf, in <hi>ver.</hi> 30. of this <hi>10th.</hi> Chapter; <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> Beſides, in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Goneſis</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.</hi> Why then will you impoſe <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> upon us, and contradict the Spirit of God; by telling us that God created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Beginning, or before he created the Heavens and the Earth?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſiderator</hi> therefore, ſhall never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his School-Divinity upon me, of one <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> and two <hi>Junior</hi> Gods; for unto me and unto us Chriſtians, there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things and we by him; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, here lies theſe Gentlemens Miſtake, they find the Scriptures in many places ſpeak of Jeſus Chriſt as Man: Therefore ſay they, he cannot be God, as my Accountant <hi>pag.</hi> 4. but as hath been obſerved, we do not ſay that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44508:37"/>
Man is God, or that the Humane Nature is the Divine; or that thoſe two Natures are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, but we believe according to the Scriptures of Truth, that God took upon him our Nature; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. and united that Holy Thing, that by the over-ſhaddow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt was conceived, and born of the Virgin: So that it did not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, nor was it a diſtinct being of it ſelf, but was united into a perſonal Union with God the Son; and thus he continues to be two Natures in one Perſon for ever. If you ask me how theſe things can be.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, ſuch Knowledge is as much too wonderful for the Angels (for ought I know) as to know how God was; and therefore neither you nor I muſt pretend to it: It is enough theſe are the true Sayings of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to the Peril of thoſe that will not believe it: If you ſay it is impoſſible, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with Men it may appear ſo and really be ſo; but with God all things are poſſible. If you ſay it is Nonſence and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer it is the higheſt impiety and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt impudence, that a Man profeſſing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a God can be guilty of; to ſay, that any thing that God reveals concerning himſelf or us; is impoſſible or contradictory to it ſelf: And therefore, after all the <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators</hi> glorying of his own, and the reſt of his Brethrens Honour and Dignity; as being Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Common-wealth of Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Page</hi> 44. both Collums. And after he hath
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44508:38"/>
ſpoken very Contumeliouſly of the Dignities of the Church, and given himſelf a good Word as a Perſon fit for Preferment: If the Honours and Profits of the Church, were beſtowed as they were at firſt deſigned, upon Perſons of Wit, Learning and Merrit; no doubt, but he might come in for an Arch-Biſhop: And yet in all this glorying, I do not find him men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one thing, that <hi>Paul</hi> a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt made any reckoning of; his Study and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying being to know Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified. No, the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> doth not ſpeak one Word of this, in all his own Letter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation; though both Colums, <hi>Pag.</hi> 44. be taken up about it; yet there is not one word of Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſpoken of, as being of any Concernment in a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore, ſeeing he hath ſuch a conceit of his own Merits, without thoſe (accounted) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary things; I would adviſe him to ſtep Over to <hi>Rome,</hi> for if he make good Friends, thoſe things are not much minded there; If he tell me there is no hope of getting a Cardinals Cap, becauſe the Doctrine of the Trinity is maintained by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the Being of God is an Article of their <hi>Creed</hi> too; and yet I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators</hi> great Learning, hath delivered him from ſo much ignorance in Church Hiſtory; That he well knows ſome Atheiſts, or Atheiſtical Fellows have by more Wit and Learning, then by ſound Reaſon, Honeſty and true God lineſs ſtept into the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

before now. And this may ſerve for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to Our Nameleſs Authors argument in his <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. where he would deny the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> becauſe tis maintained by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> An Argument ſo Weak and Fooliſh, that I did not think it worth my while, to take any other Notice of it, than occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally by the way: for ſure we ſhall never be able to maintain the Proteſtant <hi>Doctrine;</hi> If this be any Argument with us, That we are right becauſe we diſſent from them, or becauſe in many or moſt things they are wrong; but a fooliſh Cauſe muſt have fooliſh Arguments or none at all. And indeed notwithſtanding the <hi>Conſiderators</hi> vain glorious boaſting of his great Learning; I look upon him to be as great a diſhonour to the Schools, for want of Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meaſures of ſound Reaſon; as it muſt be an affliction to our Clergy, to find ſuch Hereticks harboured in the Boſom of our Church: For although he boaſt ſo much of the <hi>Mighty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,</hi> that, greater liberty in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would make, from Chriſtianity to <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm</hi> or <hi>Deiſm;</hi> yet if he had ſonnd Reaſon, and integrity anſwerable to his great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the knowledge that he muſt needs have there by in Church Hiſtory: The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Perſecution, muſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him from that fooliſh Dream; nor could he were his attainments in Divinity, and ſound Reaſon, proportionable to his great Learning; deny our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be the true God, and Eternal Life according to the Scriptures; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. when he himſelf aſſerts That in

his <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. Colum 2. and <hi>Page</hi> 26. Colum 2. which by ſound Reaſon, and by Juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequence proves him to be ſo, for he ſaith, <hi>God neither hath, nor can give him the incommunicable properties of the Deity;</hi> ſuch as Ominpotency, Omnipreſence, Omniſcience, and the; like ſo then it is but for me or any private Chriſtian, to prove that Chriſt hath thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable properties of the Divine being; and the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> himſelf will maintain that he is God. Now <hi>Sir,</hi> if you had not excepted againſt the Revelation of St. <hi>John,</hi> as being no part of Divine Writ; you know I could preſently have proved that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is Omniſcient, <hi>Rev. 2. 23.

But ſeeing the Seducers, and Cunningly deviſing fable Men of our day, under the Specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Learning and Reaſon, would fain gather up us Lay-men as Branches cut off from the true Vine; (and may ſucceed therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the withered Branches, according to what our Lord hath foretold and threatned; concerning ſuch in the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Joh.</hi> and the <hi>6th.)</hi> Yet our Lord hath given his word for it, that they ſhall not deceive the Elect, though they may and ſhall deceive many; <hi>Mat. 24. 4, 5. and</hi> 22, 23, 25. And that thoſe pretenders to Reaſon, are thoſe very deceivers among others there ſpoken of is evident; not only from our Lords words in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. calling them Falſe Prophets, and deceiving many; which they could never be able to do, if they did not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44508:39"/>
pretend Reaſon for there Cnnningly deviſed Fables; but alſo their own Practices ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray them to be Wolves in Sheeps Clothing, in treading in the very ſteps of the Grand <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dneers</hi> in our Lords-day; who that they might carry on that Fundamental Heriſie of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſurrection the more ſucceſsfully, they denyed the greateſt part of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and would own nothing for Divine Writ, but the 5 Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſticking there, they thought to confound our Lord himſelf, by their Rational and Learned Argument; that there muſt be Confuſion, Contradiction, Abſurdity and Nonſence if the dead Riſe: And you know <hi>Sir,</hi> they grounded their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument upon Scripture, and made their fooliſh Reaſon, and ignorance of the Power of God, Judge of the Cauſe. Seeing therefore, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderator</hi> is not aſhamed to tread in the <hi>Sadduces</hi> Steps, but will imitate them in denying part of the Word of God; and yet at the ſame time (as they did) pretend Reaſon and Scripture for what they held: And to give them their due, there are as many contradictions, and ſeeming impoſſibilities to Reaſon againſt the Reſurrection, as there are againſt the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Trinity; and our Faith therein, muſt be intirely reſigned up unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will and Almighty Power of God. But I ſay, ſeeing the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> will imitate the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> in denying part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; I ſhall endeavour to follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and prove from ſuch part of the Scriptures as they will own,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44508:40"/>
that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is Omniciſent and and Omnipreſent; (but at the ſame time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt their unreaſonable partiality, in chooſing and refuſing what they pleaſe for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Writ; and ſaving to the Service of the Truth all thoſe arguments that are or may be drawn from any part of the Goſpel of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Three Epiſtles</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> for deſtruction from God is a terror to me, and becauſe of his greatneſs I cannot indure to add to thoſe things, nor take away from the words of the Book of this Propheſie; leaſt God ſhould take away my part out of the Book of Life; <hi>Job 31. 22. Revelation</hi> 18. 19.) Now <hi>Sir,</hi> I think you do not except againſt the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mat.</hi> and there we read <hi>Chap. 28. ver.</hi> 20. Chriſt Promiſed his Diſciples to be with them alway, to the end of the World. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> let me freely Diſcourſe with you, concenring this Promiſe, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is gone to Heaven, and his Humane nature is to continue there till the Reſtitution of all things; neither can a Man be at two Places at one time. Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what will you do, will you give our Lord the Lye in this Promiſe; or will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a Man, or the Humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt is not only in the Sacrament of the Alter, and ſo in Thouſands of Places at the ſame time with the Papiſt; but alſo every where, in all places of the World, where ever there is a Believer: Or will you believe the Truth as it is in Jeſus, that he is the Omnipreſent God, and ſo is with his People in all places, and in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44508:40"/>
according to his gracious Promiſe; <hi>Joh. 14. 18. I will not leave you comfortleſs, I will come to you:</hi> Perhaps you will tell me, that this is no more then <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3, 4. where he tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that though he is abſent in Body, yet he as preſent in Spirit, had Judged already as though he were preſent, concerning him that hath ſo done this Deed: And in the next <hi>verſe</hi> tells them what they ſhould do, wehen they wre gathered together; and my Spirit, with the Power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Colo.</hi> 2 5. to the ſame purpoſe; but were not Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> one of the beſt, or rather the worſt at perverting of Scripture, and one of the greateſt reproachers of ſound Reaſon, under the greateſt pretentions to it; I ſhould not have mentioned theſe Scriptures, as having the leaſt ſhew of Reaſon in them, to invalidate the Truth of our Lords Promiſe; or that he will not be with his People, and that really preſent with them to the end of the World, in all Places, and in all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to that gracious Promiſe, in <hi>Iſa. 43. 2. When thou paſſeſt through the fire I will be with thee, and the waters ſhall not overflow thee.</hi> If you tell me this Promiſe in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of God the Father. I anſwer, if it be ſo, it doth but confirm our Lords Deity; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being no more then what he Promiſeth his Diſciples, which clearly proves our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be the Omnipreſent God, that fills Heaven and Earth with his preſence; for what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> is no more then what we may all ſay to one another,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44508:41"/>
when we are deſirous to have a good Work carried on by the Church, or any other Civil Society, at which we have a right to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as Member; tho' we are elſe where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, yet approving the Work we ſay, our Heart is with them, our Mind and Spirit is in the Work: But will Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> ſay, this is all the comfort our Lord promiſes his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. Truly if ſo, they might ſay of him, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of his Friends; <hi>miſerable comforters have ye been;</hi> but our Lord cannot deceive, any more then he can be deceived; and therefore he will come unto his People, and will take up his abode with them; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his gracious Promiſe in <hi>Joh. 14. 23. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid if a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him:</hi> Here the Son is to come, and be as much preſent with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as the Father: And in <hi>ver.</hi> 16. of the ſame Chapter our Lord ſaith, <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall ſend you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which, with many other Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not only prove the Son to be Omnipreſent; but alſo the Unity of the Divine being, and the Trinity of that Unity; and doth undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably prove to all ſincere, unbyaſt Chriſtians; the Divine authority and Truth of that Word in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. which Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> and the reſt of his Tribe do ſo much Bark at, but they ſhall never be able to Bite it out of Gods Bible, as long as the Sun and Moon indure; nor can they, though in Conjunction with the Gates
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44508:41"/>
of Hell; be able to Rob the People of God, of the comfort and Conſolation, that they enjoy by Communion with the real, (though Spiritual) and Divine preſence of Jeſus Chriſt. For when the Atheiſt and Deiſt, and Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have Mock'd and Scoff'd at Communion with God, as much as their Elder Brother <hi>Iſhmael</hi> himſelf did at the Son of the Promiſe; yet know ye there are that know, <hi>their Fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt; Joh.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>And yet, Mr. <hi>Conſiderator,</hi> to ſhew what a Doctor in <hi>Capernaum</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s Divinity he is, proves himſelf as good an Advocate for the abomination of Tranſubſtantion as <hi>Belarmine</hi> himſelf; or any Cardinal of them all could do: Yet is he no Papiſt but any thing; ſo he can but do ſome thing againſt the Truth; for in <hi>Page</hi> 21. Colum 2. and 22. He labours all be can, to make the abomination of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation to be a ſmall ſin, if any; which he calls a folly or a miſtake; it is not an impiety he ſaith, but a Philoſophical Error; Colum 2. <hi>Page</hi> 21. and hath miſ-repreſented that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, that he might redicule the Truth; For he ſaith, <hi>it is not pretended by the Papiſt, that the bread and Wine have received any, the leaſt change:</hi> Where as this is the very thing they have burn'd many a Chriſtian for, becauſe they would not believe that the Bread and Wine were changed; or Tranſubſtanſtiated into the very Body and blood of Chriſt: And as for his Body being preſent in a Spiritual manner, it was the Doctrine of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and not of the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:44508:42"/>
And in his <hi>20th. Page,</hi> Colum he ſaith himſelf, the Papiſts ſay, <hi>the words of our Lord import, that the Bread of the Sacrament is really, and verily made to be the Subſtance of Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>body, in which he was Crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in his <hi>Page</hi> 21. Colum 2. He tells us, they are of another Mind, and that they do not <hi>pretend that the bread and Wine, have received the leaſt change in what is an Object of Senſe:</hi> Why good <hi>Sir,</hi> is not the very Subſtance of Bread an Object of Senſe? Perhaps this Gentleman, may pretend a Licenſe to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf; but the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> muſt have a care, of ſaying any thing contrary to the dictates of Mr. <hi>Conſiderators</hi> fooliſh Reaſon; for fear of being Guilty of the unpardonable ſin of Contradicton. But the Gentleman was labouring to Contradict Chriſt, and to Charge him with Folly and Falſhood; therefore no wonder if he Contradict himſelf, for our Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be with his People, to be really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them in this World. This Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderator</hi> ſee would prove him to be God, the only true God; therefore he will Give our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour the Lye, and ſay he neither is nor can be Omnipreſent: <hi>Page</hi> 11. Colum 2. But our Lord ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. that <hi>where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them:</hi> And that <hi>the will be with his People to the end of the World,</hi> Mat. 28. 20. Yet Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> is pleaſed to ſay, the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt real preſence, is worſe then the abomination of Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> But that his Fables may paſs with ſome Colour he thinks it meet to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44508:42"/>
colour his Charge with Falſhood; and tells us of ſome, whom he ſaith, <hi>ought not to call themſelves the Reformed, who believe the real Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Sacrament,</hi> pag. 20. colume 2. But I know none of that Belief except the Papiſt, nor the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> neither I believe; but the Gentleman's Deſign was, to deny the Real Divine Preſence of Chriſt: But that being too great a Truth, to be beat out of the Scripture of Truth; he contents himſelf in that place, in denying his bodily Preſence. I have inſiſted the more on the Omnipreſence of Chriſt; becauſe Mr. <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi> in his <hi>11th. page,</hi> not only denies it; but alſo acknowledges if he be ſo, he muſt be the Living and True God; becauſe it is an incommunicable Attribute of God.</p>
            <p>Now, we have our Lor'ds Words for it over and over again; that he will be with his People in all places in the World: Now whether Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> will believe our Lord's Words, or give him the Lye; or whether his Reaſon hath taught him that the Humane Nature of Jeſus Chriſt is bodily preſent with his People; in all places and at all times; and if ſo, he gives himſelf the Lye: Or whether he will believe that he is the Living and True God, and fills Heaven and Earth with his Preſence? Let him chooſe; I am not to be accountable for his Faith.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> goes on in his <hi>11th.</hi> page, and tells us, ſome of their Number think <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be invocated in Prayer, not becauſe he is omnipreſent or omniſcient, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>

And yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Cloſe View, I do not find his Reaſons are any other, that what are contained, or may be reduc'd, to what I find in my ſhort Accountant; ſave only that his great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath puft him up with ſo much Vanity, that he is not aſhamed to ſpeak evil of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> goes on in his <hi>11th. page,</hi> from denying the Omnipreſence of Chriſt, to deny the Satisfaction of Chriſt's Death: And in <hi>page 12. colum</hi> 1. he ſaith, <hi>The end of Chriſt's Death. was to recommend Mankind to the Mercy, Forgiveneſs, and Favour of God:</hi> And again <hi>Col.</hi> 2. he ſaith, <hi>He ſuffered to recommend us unto the Mercy of God:</hi> And in <hi>page 32. colum</hi> 1. he ſaith, Though he would willingly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44508:48"/>
give it us in the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Sarum</hi>'s Words, and doth indeed no leſs than charge his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with a Diſſent from the Catholick Church, in his <hi>1ſt. colum,</hi> page 31. But in <hi>page 32. colum</hi> 1. he ſaith, <hi>The Sacrifice of Chriſt was not tendered to the Juſtice of God, as an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Amends or Reparation; but to his mercy as a Supplication, and as ſuch accepted.</hi> And this he ſaith, the <hi>Socinians</hi> contend for; but pray Sir, let us reaſon the Caſe a little, about this Account that you give of the End of Chriſt's Death: But firſt let it be remembred, that you grant, that Chriſt died to expiate the Sins of Mankind; <hi>page 31. col.</hi> 2. This expiation was not offered to the Juſtice of God you ſay, but to his Mercy; and to his Mercy, not as an Expiation of Guilt; but as a Supplication for Mercy: This is a double Contradiction, I ſee the Gentleman will not prove himſelf a ſmall Fool; for firſt, you ſet the Cauſe in the place of the Effect; and the Effect in the place of the Cauſe: And in the ſecond place, you deſtroy the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mercy, and make it no other than Juſtice it ſelf; in that an expiatory and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of Mankind, muſt be offered up thereunto: <hi>Firſt,</hi> You make the Effect to be the Cauſe of that, which it is but the Effect of: For the Mercy and Love of God was the firſt, and only moving Cauſe of God's ſending his Son into the World; and therefore all that he did in the World could not be the Cauſe, nor ſo much as a Means ro procure his Mercy; conſider'd
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44508:49"/>
without reſpect to Juſtice: <hi>John 3. 16. For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> 
               <q>Mercy and Love in God, (as the truly Rational and Heavenly Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath obſerved) being no leſs than God's willing good to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and whoever God wills Good to, they muſt have that Good willed to them:</q>  For God's Will in this Sence, muſt infallibly be done both in Heaven and in Earth. But God will not convey Good to any Creature, in a way that ſhall deſtroy a greater Good; then the Salvation of all the Men and Angels in Heaven and Earth will amount unto. But ſuch is the Manifeſtation of the Glory of God's Juſtice, therefore though God's loving Kindneſs and Mercy was from everlaſting, and therefore needed not a Sacrifice in time to procure it; much leſs a propitiatory one to appeaſe it which is a Contradiction with a Witneſs; but this is not to be taken Notice of in Men, that have ingroſs'd all contradiction to themſelves, under the ſpecious pretence of Reaſon; for 'tis below the pretended Wits of our Day, the Great, Vain glorious Freemen of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth of Wit and Learning, to prove themſelves little Fools.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, Mercy will never be extended in a way, that in the leaſt derogates from the Juſtice and Truth of God: No, Juſtice and Truth muſt be equally exalted with Mercy, where-ever it is extended: Therefore when
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44508:49"/>
God proclaims his Name in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. he proclaims himſelf to be a God that will ſhew Mercy, and yet will by no means clear the guilty. This you Men of Reaſon are pleaſed to contradict, and do in ſo many words tell us; that a Debt fully paid, and yet freely for given is a contradiction; Nameleſs Author <hi>page 6. col.</hi> 1. And Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> calls it a Mock Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>pag. 13. col.</hi> 1. But we know the things of God, uſeth to be accounted Fooliſhneſs with Men; but Thanks be to God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we do as well know that God hath made fooliſh the Wiſdom of this World; and that the fooliſhneſs of God is Wiſer then Men; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20, 21,—25, 26, 27. But in the aforeſaid <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. The Lord proclaims himſelf to be <hi>the Lord God, merciful and Gracious, long ſuffering, and abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth.</hi> Pray obſerve, goodneſs and Truth muſt go together, and without Truth Goodneſs would ceaſe to be ſo. And in <hi>verſe</hi> 7. He ſaith, <hi>Keeping Mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and ſin;</hi> and that will by no means clear theguilty. Now Gentlemen are you not aſhamed, if you are not you may be; to ſay a Debt fully paid, and yet Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgiven is a Contradiction; for do you not thereby Contradict God himſelf and Charge him with Folly and Falſhood; who ſaith, he will <hi>pardon iniquity and forgive ſin; and yet will by no means clear the guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely God is true, and can no more Lye then he can dye or deny himſelf; therefore his infinite
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44508:50"/>
wiſdom hath contrived that which his Almighty Power hath effected, a way to pardon ſin; and yet by no means clear the guilty. This could not be done by offering up a Sacrifice to the Mercy of God, nor was there any need of ſuch a thing: Mercy being the firſt moving Cauſe of ſetting infinite Wiſdom to Work, to find out a way to ſave the ſinner, and yet not clear the guilty; and at the ſame time to ſave the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Gods Law, and to vindicate the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of his Truth, to ſhew Mercy to the ſinner; and yet at the ſame time to magnifie his Law, and make it Honourable; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 21. to magnifie his Mercy, and yet at the ſame time, and by the ſame way and means, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the very ſame Perſons; to exalt his Juſtice. This was a Work becoming God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Created being had Wiſdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do ſo; and as it is wonderful in its own Nature, ſo likewiſe ſhould it be to us; and Humbly and thankfully cloſed up with. It is not to be quarrelled with, but if you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Counſel of God againſt your ſelves, becauſe it is Fooliſhneſs with you; yet know you that to them that believe, Chriſt is the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God; and they do receive this Truth with all manner of Acceptation. And although it may ſeem to be fooliſhneſs to you wiſe <hi>Grecians,</hi> yet to them that believe both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> Chriſt is the Wiſdom of God and the Power of God; hence it comes to paſs, that the Lord is well pleaſed for his Righteouſneſs ſake, he thereby magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Law, and making it Honorable; this anſwers the end of God, both in Creation and

A wiſe Man will not do great, and Noble things for a baſe and low End; how much leſs will God ſave ſinners in a way, that advances the Glory of one attribute to the abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in the leaſt Ecclipſiing the Glory of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: This would reflect on his Wiſdom and Power, but God will not, God cannot extend Mercy in a way, that may reflect on his Juſtice and Truth: If the King pardon a Convicted Traytor, he thereby extends his Mercy, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44508:51"/>
ſhews a great deal of Pitty, and Compaſſion, and good Will to the Perſon of the Traytor: But he cannot with reſpect to that Perſon, but ſtop the Execution of Juſtice, and the Law in that particular Falls to the Ground; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is Man, and not God; but not one jot, nor Title of Gods Law ſhall Fall to the Ground; neither ſhall Juſtice be in the leaſt ſtopt or Suſpended, by Gods extending Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Sinner; becauſe the Lord is God and not Man: Therefore we Read, that <hi>Mercy and Truth are met together, Righteouſneſs and Peace have kiſſed each other. Pſal.</hi> 85. 10. God is as Juſt in Juſtifiing him that Believeth in Jeſus, as he is in Condemning the Unbeliever; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. So that it as clear as the Sun ſhining at Noon day; that as Mercy was the firſt and only moving Cauſe, of Gods ſending his Son into the World to ſave Sinners; and therefore there was no need of his coming to procure Mercy, his coming being the greateſt Demonſtration of Mercy and Love; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. So likewiſe is it a Demonſtration that all he did, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially what he Suffered; was with reſpect to Juſtice. The determinate Counſels of the Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, the one Eternal God; had firſt, if we may to help the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our underſtanding uſe ſuch an expreſſion; as Firſt or Second, concerning the decrees of God. I ſay, the Firſt thing God had in his Eye in ſaving Sinners, by ſending his Son into the World; was the Manifeſtation of his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: This being the beſt good muſt be the Firſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44508:51"/>
Cauſe, and Laſt End of all Gods Works; and in Subordination thereunto, Gods Mercy and great Love wherewith he Loved us, was the moving Cauſe of ſending his Son into the World, with reſpect to God himſelf; the Manifeſtation of his own Glory was the Cauſe, and muſt be the Effect and laſt End thereof with reſpect to us; Love, Pity, and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Mercy, was the Firſt moving Cauſe, and our Eternal Salvation the laſt End; ſo then if Chriſt came to Expiate ſin, or to take away ſin; it muſt be to bear the puniſhment due to ſin, or to the Sinner for ſin; to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the guilt of ſin; which cannot be done but by bearing the puniſhment due for ſin; the guilt muſt be taken away. For God will by no means, therefore not by Mercy it ſelf, clear the guilty: Therefore the guilt muſt be taken away, that Mercy may flow in with all its Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed effects upon the Sinner; therefore the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſending his Son, was the Higheſt Act of Mercy in the Father; and the Sons coming and dying in our Nature, was the higheſt Act of Love in the Son: The thing it Self was all Mercy with reſpect to us, and the doing of it was with reſpect to the Honour of Gods Law, and and the Manifeſtation of his Juſtice and Truth: Therefore Chriſt did not offer himſelf up as a Supplication to the Mercy of God, but as an expiatory Sacrifice to his Juſtice; and not as a partial expiating of ſin, for that would but in part take away guilt; but all guilt muſt be taken away, or elſe the ſinner will remain guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and God will by no means clear the guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:44508:52"/>
Hence we read of Gods forgiving for Chriſts ſake, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 32. and of Redemption through his Blood the forgiveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of his Grace. Here is Redemption, but at no leſs Price than the Blood of Ghriſt; here is the forgiveneſs of ſins, but it is through the Blood of Chriſt; for we are not Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Corruptible things, but by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of Chriſt; <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>All which ſhews that we are freely Forgiven, and yet Juſtice is fully ſatisfied; God having no Motive, nor was it poſſible he ſhould, to concern himſelf about our Salvation; but his own Soveraign good Will and good Pleaſure, he will have Mercy, becauſe he will have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: This makes the difference between Man and Man, and this makes the difference between Man and Devil; he took not upon him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And what ever Reaſons may be given for this, by thoſe wiſe Criticks that will vainly intrude into thoſe things that they have not ſeen; yet they muſt at laſt all Center in this; <hi>Even ſo O Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſeth thee.</hi> It was the good pleaſure of God to ſave his Elect, therefore Chriſt did not come to purchaſe this good pleaſure; but to Execute it by taking away ſin, both in its guilt and filth, and to bring in an Everlaſting Righteouſneſs: Therefore we read, <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand;</hi> Iſa. 53. 10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. And our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord doth ſo often declare, <hi>that he came not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him;</hi> that is needleſs to mention particular Scriptures to prove it: All which ſhows that Chriſt offering himſelf
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44508:52"/>
up by the Eternal Spirit as a Sacrifice to God; was to take away ſin, both in the guilt and filth of it; and had reſpect to the Juſtice and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God to Vindicate his Truth, and the Honour of his Law, in ſhewing Mercy to the Sinner: Therefore it is ſaid, he was made ſin for us, that we might be made the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in him; and in reſpect to Mercy and Love, our Lord tells us, <hi>At that day ye ſhall ask in my name: and I ſay not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: For the Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf loveth you,</hi> Joh. 16. 26. Yet if any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> of <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. And he tells us again, <hi>At that day ye ſhall ask in my name; and I ſay unto you, that I will pray the Father for you;</hi> and in <hi>Joh. 16. ver. 23. Verily verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you:</hi> Which compared with <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. 14. ſhews that the Father and the Son are One, for ſaith he, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</hi> And again, in the next <hi>Verſe, If ye ſhall ask anything in my name, I will do it.</hi> All which ſhews that Chriſt did not purchaſe, nor doth he interceed for the Fathers Love and Mercy, but interceeds as an Advocate pleading his own merrit in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away ſin, and bringing in an Everlaſting Righteouſneſs; ſo that is for Gods glory, the Honour of his Law, the ſtrickneſs of his Juſtice, to ſhew Mercy to the Sinner: Therefore he ſaith, <hi>I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son:</hi> And indeed, it is little leſs then the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44508:53"/>
Blaſphemy to ſay, that the Fathers Love and Mercy is not ſo great, or was not ſo early as the Sons; for God is of one Mind, and who can turn him. Having thus proved that Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf up as a Sacrifice to the Juſtice of God to make an Attouement for Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>It will be neceſſary to enquire, what kind of Prieſt and Sacrifice this muſt be, what mighty Mediator this muſt be that interpoſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Juſtice of God and the guilty Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Aand as the Doctrine of Satisfaction, ought to be received with all Humility and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, with all Care and Watchfulneſs, to prove our ſelves to be of the number of thoſe, that are Redeemed from a vain Converſation; and to have a Witneſs within us, even the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to bear Witneſs with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God;</hi> and ſhew out of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation the Virtues of him, <hi>that hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi> Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Grace of God that hath appeared to us, hath Effectually <hi>Taught us to deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, and Worldly Luſt, and to live Godlily, and Righteouſly, and ſoberly in this preſent evil World:</hi> And that we do not only look to the Blood of Chriſt, to deliver us from the guilt of ſin; but we do alſo Live by Faith on him, and do find his Blood Effectual to Cleanſe us from the Filth of Sin; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. ſo ſhould we in our inquiry after this Mighty Saviour, be Serious and Humble; Reſolving to guide our Reaſon by the Word of God, Subjecting all the Powers and Faculties of our Souls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; Humbly imploring the Spirits aid and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44508:53"/>
ſpecial aſſiſtance, without which we cannot diſcern the things of God, becauſe they are Spiritually diſcerned. And ſurely, this mighty Salvation can be wrought out, by no other then an Almighty Saviour; whom we Read of in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 1. One that ſpeaks in Righteouſneſs, that hath dyed Garments; and therefore Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vielleth in the greatneſs of his ſtrength, and is mighty to ſave; and therefore this mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer muſt be no other then God's fellow, which no Created being can be ſpoken of; <hi>Zacha.</hi> 13. 7. And this is evident from the Nature of the Work, which hath been already proved he was to do; which was to bring in an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Righteouſneſs, and to make an Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin; <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. Which no Created Being could do, for no Man nor Angel, nor any Created Being whatſoever can be Profitable to God, as he that is wiſe can be Profitable to himſelf, <hi>Job.</hi> 22. 2. And not only are Chriſt's Diſciples, but all Created beings are unprofitable Servants; <hi>Job 4. 18. Behold he puteth no truſt in his ſervants; and he chargeth his Angels with folly:</hi> None can do any more then their duty, therefore none can come in as Mediators between God and ſinful Creatures; none have any Excellency but what they have received from God: Therefore it is but their duty, to return all back again to him, from whom they received their Beings, and all the Excellency thereof; and the more any Creature receives, the more is he in Debt to the Giver. So that it is utterly impoſſible, for a Creature to interpoſe, between the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Juſtice of God and a guilty Sinner; the Nature of a Created being will not, cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44508:54"/>
of ſuch a thing: Therefore, ſeeing our Lord Jeſus Chriſt did interpoſe between God and Sinners; he muſt be ſuch a days Man, as could lay his hand both on God and Man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be that Child given to us, whoſe name is called <hi>Wonderful Counſellor, the mighty God, the Everlaſting Father;</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. And indeed were he not ſo, we could have no Comfort here, nor happineſs hereafter by all that he did or Suffered.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> What comfort could we have here, or Expectation of happineſs hereafter; from what he did if he were but a Man, or any Created being only; If he were but a Creature, though ſuch an imaginary One as Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> ſpeaks of, in <hi>Page.</hi> 57. 1. and Colum 1. 2. Created before God Created the Heavens and the Earth yet he being but a Creature, could merit nothing for us, that Command to Love the Lord with all the heart, and all the might, and all the ſtrength, makes it the indiſpenſable duty of every Created Being; to do all that they are Capable of doing in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God: And in ſo doing, they do but their own duty, which is but their Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Service. The Nature of a Created Being, if we could ſuppoſe ſuch a One; as might be Ten Thouſand times more Glorious and Excellent, then the moſt Glorious Angel in Heaven; yet being but a Creature, it ows its being, and all that it is Capable of doing to its Creator; It can pay no more then its own Juſt Debt: And the more Excellent it is, the more it is obliged to God to pay the ſame.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44508:54"/>
So that it is utterly impoſſible, to find Works of Superrogation in any Created being; ſo then if Chriſt were not the true God, he could Merit nothing for us by all that he did, for If you tell me there have been ſome Men, ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the like; for whoſe ſake God ſaith, he will do good to their Poſterity: I Anſwer, ſuch Expreſſions are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be taken Figuratively as they were Types of Chriſt; or as Declarations of Gods Faithfulneſs, in keeping Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed for ever: But all thoſe Men had a Mediator, to take away there own Guilt, for it is Written, <hi>there is none good, no, not one.</hi> Therefore they being ſaved by the Mercy of God, conveyed to them through the Merrits of Chriſt; it is impoſſible that they could do any thing, for the ſake of which, God ſhould ſhew. Mercy to their Poſterity. For if an ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Creature can do but its duty, how much leſs can a ſinful Man, though renewed by Grace; do any thing to Merit for another.</p>
            <p>And here both Mr. <hi>Conſiderator,</hi> and our Nameleſs Author, may take an Anſwer to their <hi>Babels-Tower;</hi> that they have thought to build ſo High as to reach Heaven, by their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chriſt Example; concerning which, I ſhall only ask theſe Gentlemen, Two or Three Queries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether they think the Law of God was not a perfect Rule of Righteouſneſs, though our Lord had never come into the World?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:44508:55"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If it was neceſſary, that our Lord ſhould come into the World to give us an Example only or chiefly; what ſhould be the Reaſon, why he was not ſent as ſoon, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sin entered into the World?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we are ſaved by following Chriſt's Example, what is become of <hi>Abraham, David;</hi> and all the Old Teſtament Saints that lived and dyed before he gave this Example?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I would ask Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and my Nameleſs Author; whether they do not think in their Conſciences, if God ſhould enter into Judgment with them, and deal with them according to their following, or not following Chriſt's Example; they muſt not unavoidably periſh without any hope of Mercy. Perhaps theſe Gentlemens Ignorance, both of God, the Law, and of Sin, which is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the ſame; may furniſh them with a ready Anſwer to the laſt Query, the ſame that one of their Tribe gave me, above twenty years agoe to a Queſtion of the like Nature; namely, that he did not know, whether a vain Thought were a Sin or no? But whatever their Anſwer may be to the aforeſaid Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I am taught by the Word of God, and ſound Reaſon drawn from the ſame; to believe that it is theſe Gentlemens Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, of his Law, and of themſelves; that firſt laid the Foundation of this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Fabrick in their Hearts; and is ſtill the Principal Matter and Stuff, by which this <hi>Babel</hi> Tower is carried on and ſupported.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:44508:55"/>
But let us next conſider, what Comfort here or Happineſs hereafter, we could expect from our Redeemers Suffering; if he were but a Man, or any Created Being whatſoever: And here it may be remembred, that it hath been already proved, that no Creature can merit any thing from God by doing; but may not an innocent Creature's Suffering, merit ſomething at the Hands of God for others?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, there are but three Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts or Reaſons, for which we can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God ſhould afflict or puniſh his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His own abſolute Sovereignty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Dominion that God hath over all his Creatures; and whatever he doth on this Account. We all know he can do no Injuſtice. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. God puniſhes the Creature for its own Sin or Guilt. Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the Guilt of ſome other.</p>
            <p>But our Lord Jeſus Chriſt did not ſuffer for himſelf, for though the Meſſiah was cut off, it was not for himſelf but for his People; <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 16. For <hi>He had no Sin nor was guile found in his Mouth.</hi> And it hath been proved by Gods own Proclamation, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. that Guilt muſt be taken away, or elſe the guilty Sinner cannot be cleared; and ſo will remain under the Law and under the Curſe. Now Guilt cannot be taken away, without ſuffering the Puniſhment that Guilt bound the Sinner over to; this could not be done by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44508:56"/>
a Man only, or any limited Power whatſoever. This Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> not only owns in <hi>pag.</hi> 31 and 32. but alſo denies that the Acts of Chriſt, though they were of an infinite Value, which yet he will not own they were; but if they were, he argues againſt the Satisfaction of Juſtice thereby; becauſe he ſaith, <hi>One infinlte Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is not equivalent to all thoſe Guilts and Puniſhments, each of which is infinite:</hi> And this he calls a Reaſoning or Computation, which is ſelf-evident; but why doth not Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderator</hi> ſee, that his Arguing is ſelf-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, one while he will not own our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be God, becauſe he ſaith, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies more infinites than one: Which he ſaith, is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Now, to render him an inſufficient Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he tells us of a great many, infinite Guilts, which one infinite Saviour is not able to grapple with. What Pains doth this Gentleman take to prove, that he is not of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Mind and Faith; who ſaith, <hi>Chriſt loved him and gave hsmſelf for him.</hi> And that he is not concern'd to be one of that Number ſpoken of, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3, 4, 5. where 'tis ſaid he bare our Iniquities, Griefs, Sorrows, Chaſtiſements; and by his Stripes we are healed. And if he bare our Sins or Puniſhments, as the Scripture doth ſo often declare; he either bare all that was due from Divine Juſtice, or he bare but a part: If he bare but a part, we are but partly cleared, he is but a part Saviour; Guilt is but in part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and finally we can be but partly ſaved,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44508:56"/>
which is to be fully condemned; for God will by no means clear the guilty.</p>
            <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> ſpeaks of a great many infinite Sins and Guilts; yet it is certain that Sin neither is, nor can in its own Nature be infinite; though as it is committed againſt Infinite Juſtice and Goodneſs, it hath a kind of infinite Evil in it; but properly it is not, nor can be infinite: For as there is but one Good that is God, ſo there is but one Infinite, that is, God. And indeed Mr. <hi>Conſiderator,</hi> ſhould have conſidered, that as he argues in his <hi>33d.</hi> page; he makes it as poſſible for Sin to deſtroy the very being of God, as to overthrow the Satisfaction of Chriſt. For Sin is Enmity againſt God, and if it had power it would deſtroy God; but as great, and as exceeding ſinful as ſin is, yet the Power of God is able to ſubdue it, and the Goodneſs of God is able to overcome it, and the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt are able to take away the Guilt of it.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith, that one (ſuppoſed) infinite Satisfaction, is not equivalent to a great many infinite guilts, I have already prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our Lords Satisfaction was not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but really ſuch as Anſwred Divine Juſtice, by taking away all guilt from all his Elect, elſe they could not be cleared, and conſequently not ſaved. And as for his ſetting many infinites of guilt and ſin, againſt one infinite ſatisfaction; if it had pleaſed God, to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44508:57"/>
endue him but with half ſo much ſound Reaſon, as he hath beſtowed on many of the Common People; of whom Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> hath Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in his <hi>Pag. 30. Colum</hi> 1. That they ſhall turn Divines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and raze the very Foundation of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> I ſay, had Mr. <hi>Conſiderator</hi> been a Legal Freeman of the Common-wealth of ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as he Boaſts <hi>Pag. 44. Colum</hi> 1. he would have eaſily ſeen, that his Argument, is every Whit as ſtrong for the deſtroying of God himſelf, and Cauſing him to ceaſe to be; as againſt the ſatisfaction of Chriſt. For if there be a great many infinite ſins and guilts, and therefore one infinite ſatisfaction cannot Anſwer them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many to one is odds: By the ſame Reaſon, there being a great many infinite Evils, and but one infinite good; many to one being odds, the many infinite Evils muſt deſtroy the one infinite good: Thus we ſee God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and makes their Knowledge fooliſhneſs; and it is a thing to be much obſerved, that there is ſcarce any one Argument, that our pretenders to Reaſon make uſe of againſt our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: But when it is lookt into, a Man may ſee that an Atheiſt may with as much Reaſon, urge the ſame againſt the very being of God. The Wiſdom, and Juſtice, and Soveraginty of God herein is to be humbly and thankfully adored, in that <hi>he is pleaſed to hide thoſe things from the wiſe and prudent; and to reveal them to Babes, even ſo O Father becauſe it pleaſeth thee,</hi> This ſhould teach all, both learned and unlearned, to believe God to be, as he himſelf reveals himſelf in his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44508:57"/>
Word to be; leaſt while we proudly go about to make God like our Selves, we provoke him to Leave us to our Selves; and then Wiſdom muſt periſh from the Wiſe, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the prudent; and in denying God to be as he is; we ſhall proceed to deny him to be. And indeed, as great <hi>Charnock</hi> hath well obſerved, of the two; it is a greater evil to deny him to be as he is, then to deny him to be.</p>
            <p>Let every ſincere Chriſtian therefore, make it his dayly Prayer to Almighty God, to give him an underſtanding, that he may know him that is true; and alſo know, that he is in him, that is true; even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>This is the true God and eternal Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 20. and let us, one and all with Heart and Voice, yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the will and Command of God; <hi>Joh. 5. in honouring the Son, even as we honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Joyning with thoſe Bleſſed Ones we Read of <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Singing Songs of Praiſe and Thankſgiving to the Lamb, <hi>who hath redeemed us by his blood, and made us Kings, and Prieſts unto our God:</hi> Saying, <hi>Bleſſing and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Glory and Power, be unto him that ſitteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne; and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> And let all that Love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in Sincerity, ſay, A men, and Amen.</p>
