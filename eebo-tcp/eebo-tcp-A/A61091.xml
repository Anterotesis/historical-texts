            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE needs no more to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
this Tract to every good <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Christian, than the Nature
of the <hi>Subject,</hi> and the Name of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</hi>
A <hi>Subject</hi> of the greatest Importance
to the Honour of God, and the decent Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Religion. An <hi>Author</hi> of profound
Learning and true Integrity, who devoted his
Studies to the more particular Service of this
Church and Nation.</p>
            <p>But for the Character of this honour'd
Writer, and the full Account of his excellent
Works, I refer to the <hi>Life</hi> of Sir <hi>Henry Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
lately prefix'd to the elegant Edition of
his <hi>Posthumous Works,</hi> by the well known
and well deserving Mr. <hi>Gibson;</hi> who has
Candor enough to think it a pardonable Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
if I transcribe from Him, only so much
as relates to this particular Treatise.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Another Work (<hi>saith he</hi>) in Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Rights of the Church, is
still in Manuscript, with this Title; <hi>The
History and Fate of Sacrilege, discover'd
<pb facs="tcp:48454:3"/>
by Examples of Scripture, of Heathens,
and of Christians; from the beginning
of the World continually to this Day, by
Sir</hi> Henry Spelman, <hi>Kt.</hi> Anno Dom. 1632.</q>
The Account which the <hi>Oxford</hi> Antiquary
gives of it is this: </p>
            <q>
               <p>In the Year 1663.
Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> began to print the <hi>History
of Sacrilege,</hi> designed and began by
Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> and left to Mr. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi>
to perfect and publish. But that
Work sticking long in the Press, both the
Copy and Sheets printed off, perisht in the
grand Conflagration of <hi>London</hi> 1666. I have been told by a learned Divine (since
a Prelate of our Church) that Mr. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi>
was forbidden to proceed in an Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Work, lest the Publication of
it should give Offence to the <hi>Nobility</hi> and
<hi>Gentry.</hi> But, whatever was the occasion
of its continuing in the Press till the <hi>Fire</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> it has been taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the whole Book was irrecoverably
lost; and I was satisfied of the same, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Mr. <hi>Wood</hi>'s Relation of the matter;
till examining some Manuscripts, which
were given to the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library, by the
late Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> I met with a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
of some part of it. Vpon further
inquiry, I found other parts in other places;
so that now the Work seems to be pretty
entire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48454:4"/>
He begins with a general definition
of <hi>Sacrilege;</hi> then reckons up various
kinds of it, as to <hi>Places, Persons,</hi> and
<hi>Things;</hi> after which, he enumerates (at
large) the many signal Punishments of it
among <hi>Heathens, Jews</hi> and <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
describing more particularly the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of that kind, which have formerly
happen'd in our Nation. Then, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to give an Account of the attempt
upon the Lands of the Clergy in <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>IV</hi>'s time, and how it was disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
afterwards he descends to the Suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>Priories Alien</hi> in the Reign of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, and so on to the General
Dissolution under <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.
Here he shews us the several steps of
the <hi>Dissolution;</hi> the King's express Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to employ the Lands to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning, Religion, and Relief
of the Poor; with the remarkable Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
that ensued, upon the <hi>King,</hi> his
<hi>Posterity,</hi> his principal <hi>Agents</hi> in that
Affair, the new <hi>Owners</hi> of the Lands, and
the <hi>Lords</hi> who promoted, and Pass'd the
Dissolution Act; concluding with a
Chapter, which contains <hi>The particulars
of divers Monasteries in</hi> Norfolk, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the late Owners since the Dissolution,
are extinct, or decay'd, or overthrown
<pb facs="tcp:48454:4"/>
by Misfortunes and grievous Accidents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This (<hi>continues he,</hi>) is a short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of a large Work, wherein the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Author is far from affirming, that
<hi>their</hi> being concern'd in this Affair, (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as Promoters of the Alienation,
or Possessors of the Lands) was directly the
occasion of the Calamities that ensued. On
the contrary, he declares more than once,
that he will not presume to judge of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
methods of God's Providence; but
only relates plain Matters of Fact, and
leaves every Man to make his own Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
tho' it must be granted, that many
of the Instances, (and those well asserted)
are so terrible in the <hi>Event,</hi> and in the
<hi>Circumstances</hi> so surprising, that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
Man can well pass them over, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a serious Reflection. This <hi>Discourse</hi>
might have appear'd among his other <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous
Works,</hi> but that some Persons in
the present Age, would be apt to interpret
the mention of their Predecessors, (in such
a manner, and upon such an occasion) as
an unpardonable Reflection upon their
<hi>Families.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>To this fair account of the late Editor
I have nothing more to add, but This, that
in <hi>him</hi> there might be prudential Reasons to
exclude this Treatise from the Volume of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquiae
<pb facs="tcp:48454:5"/>
Spelmannianae.</hi> But it has happen'd,
that a true Copy of the Manuscript is now
fall'n into the Hands of (it seems) a less
discreet Person, who will e'en let the World
make what Vse of it they please. But, to
prevent all suspicion of any indirect dealings
in Mr. <hi>G—,</hi> I do him this Justice, to
averr, That he is no way, either by Advice,
or Consent, or so much as Connivence, privy
to the Publication of it.</p>
            <p>There is one other Office of Respect due to
the Ashes of the Venerable Author, which is
to observe, that his accuteness of Thought,
and propriety of Style, and other unaffected
Talents of his Mind, and Pen, are not to be
measured only by this <hi>one</hi> Performance; for
indeed, this <hi>History of Sacrilege,</hi> seems the
most Abortive of all his other <hi>Posthumous
Works.</hi> At least, as we now find it, we
have but the rough Draught of some Noble
Structure which he had wisely projected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himself, to be improv'd and compleated at
his own leisure; and therefore the Abruptness
here, and the Prolixness there, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
little defaults of Language and Connexion,
wou'd derogate from so great a Hand; but
that the ruder Stroaks of some few Artists
will be ever more admir'd, than the finisht
Pieces of several Others.</p>

God, as <hi>Alexander, Caius Caligula, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
Nero,</hi> and others. In this high Sin
are Blasphemers, Sorcerers, Witches and
Inchanters: And as it maketh the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48454:7"/>
Irruption into the glorious Majesty of
Almighty God, so it maketh also the
greatest Divorce betwixt God and Man.</p>
               <p>In this Sin above all others, was <hi>Satan</hi>
most desirous to plunge our first Parents
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> that as himself by it had
fallen from all Felicity, so he might draw
them likewise into the same Perdition:
<hi>You shall be,</hi> saith he, <hi>like God, knowing
good and evil.</hi> That Divine Faculty of
<hi>knowing good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> tickled the itching
Humour of a weak Woman, and to be
<hi>like God,</hi> fired her wholly with Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and carried her and <hi>Adam</hi> into the
highest Kind of <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> committing
thereby Robbery upon the Deity it self:
for so it is censur'd, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 6. where
it is declared, that to be <hi>equal with God
was no robbery in the Second Adam,</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by an <hi>Antithesis,</hi> that it was a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
(and so a Sacrilege) in the First
<hi>Adam;</hi> who is also guilty in the other
Kind of Sacrilege, by taking the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Fruit reserv'd from him, as the
Priest's Portion; for Knowledge belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Priest.</p>
               <p>Thus the first Man that was created
fell into Sacrilege several ways, and so
did also the first Man that was born of
a Woman. <hi>Cain</hi> bringeth an Oblation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48454:8"/>
to God, but sacrilegiously either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the best of his Fruits, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the worst, as some conceiv'd, <hi>rectè
offert, sed non rectè dividit,</hi> or doing it
hypocritically, as the later expoundeth
it; which soever it was (and like enough
to be both ways) he robb'd God of his
Honour and Divine Faculty of knowing
all things: he granted him to be Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
but not Omniscient; he did not
think him to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to know
the secret Thoughts of a Man's Heart:
upon which reason St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> chargeth
him also with another Sacrilege (<hi>de Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diso,</hi>
cap. 24.) in answering God, that
he could not tell what was become of his
Brother, when himself had murthered
him; <hi>crimine Sacrilegii</hi> (saith <hi>Ambrose)
quod Deo credidit mentiendum,</hi> with the
Crime of Sacrilege, in that he durst lye
to God's own Face: A Pattern to the
Sacrilege of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> in the
<hi>Acts of the Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To my Understanding <hi>Cain</hi> is yet
chargeable with another grievous Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
even the Murther of his Brother;
for in it he destroy'd the Temple of God,
and in that Temple the very Sacred Image
of God: <hi>Do ye not know,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,
2 Cor. 3. 16. that you are the temple of God,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48454:8"/>
and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi>
and again positively, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 16. Ye are
the temple of the living God.</hi> This Temple
did <hi>Cain</hi> sacrilegiously destroy, and the
Spirit of God which dwelled in it, did he
also sacrilegiously deface and expell; even
that holy Spirit was the very Image of
God, for <hi>in the image of God created he him,</hi>
Gen. 1. 27.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeareth, that <hi>Sacrilege</hi> was
the first Sin, the Master-Sin, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sin at the beginning of the World,
committed in Earth by Man in Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
commited in Paradise by Man in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
committed in Heaven it self by
the Angels in Glory; against God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by arrogating his Power, against
God the Son by contemning his Word,
against God the Holy Ghost by propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
things Sanctified, and against all of
them in general by invading and viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Deity. Let us now see how God
revenged himself upon Sinners, in this
kind, and by way of Collation apply it to
our selves: for his Wisdom and Power
and Justice are the same perpetually.</p>

                  <p>The Punishment of Sacrilege in Lucifer
and the Angels, upon Adam, Eve, and
Cain, and upon the old World, by the
Flood, and upon them that built the
Tower of Babel, Nimrod, and others.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIrst, He punished them by disinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
and casting them out of their
Original Possession. <hi>Lucifer</hi> is cast out of
Heaven; <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> out of Paradise;
<hi>Cain</hi> (whose Name signifies a Possession)
out of his Native Possession, to be a
Runnagate upon Earth: All of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of the Favour of God, and all
of them subject to a perpetual Curse.
<hi>Lucifer</hi> to perpetual Darkness, <hi>Adam</hi> to
perpetual Labour, and <hi>Cain</hi> to perpetual
Fear and Instability: By perpetual, I
mean, during their Lives; for at their
Death they all meet in Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Life of Satan is till the Day
of Judgment; so, though he liveth so
long, he reigneth in Labour and Travel
to work Wickedness: there is his End,
and then is the time of his further and
Eternal Punishment; then shall he and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48454:9"/>
all his Angels be cast into <hi>everlasting fire,
Matt.</hi> 25. 41. 46. there I leave both him
and them hopeless of Mercy, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
is graciously extended to
<hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity repenting, by the
meritorious Passion of our Saviour, who
to expiate the Sacrilege committed by
Man, in aspiring to be like God, deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself, being God, to become a
Man: And as Man would have left the
Earth, and have scaled the Heaven, so He
left the Heaven, and came down into
the Earth, living here in Subjection to
Man, when Man himself would not be
subject to God: Therefore (<hi>ut contraria
contrariis curantur</hi>) as the Sacrilege was
a Capital Sin, that contained in it many
other specifical Sins, Pride, Ambition,
Rebellion, Hypocrisie, Malice, Robbery,
and many other hellish Impieties; so for
a punctual Satisfaction he made himself
a Capital Sacrifice, that contained innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Graces, Humility, Contempt of
the World, and of himself, Obedience,
Sincerity, Love, Bounty, and all other
Celestial Virtues.</p>
               <p>The Contemplation of this exorbitant
Mercy, which I leave to be sounded forth
by the Golden Trumpets of the Church,
hath led me a little forth of my Course.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48454:10"/>
I return to <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity, and
will go on with them safely, as I find them
left in the hands of Justice, and the dint
of the Curse. <hi>Adam</hi> in his Children, and
they in him are all unhappy: His good Son
<hi>Abel</hi> is cruelly murthered and by whom?
but (to encrease his Grief) by his other
Son <hi>Cain,</hi> who according to the Law of
Nature ought to dy for it, as himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 14. and then was <hi>Adam</hi>
destitute of them both. Yet so is he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding;
for his Son <hi>Cain,</hi> the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
is a condemned Person, a banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man, and a continual Fugitive to
save his Life; which nevertheless was
at length casually taken from him by the
hand of <hi>Lamech;</hi> as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> (out of
an Author (reporteth ad <hi>Damasum,</hi> p...
Tom... Thus two of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sons

<hi>Seth,</hi> living wickedly, are not therefore
mentioned in Holy Scriptures. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their worldly Affairs, all was evil,
and out of course; Labour, and Sweat,
and Sorrow vex their Persons; the Beasts
of the Earth, and the Fowls of the Air,
that formerly were subject to <hi>Adam,</hi> will
rebell and become his Enemies; the
Earth, that formerly gave him Sustenance
of her own accord, will now yield no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48454:10"/>
but by compulsion; and is besides
unto him both false and refractory: He
commits his Corn unto it, and it renders
him <hi>Thistles</hi> and <hi>Weeds;</hi> he planteth
his Vineyard in it, and it bringeth him
<hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Briars:</hi> All the Works of
Man are now in the <hi>sorrow of his hands,
Gen. 3. 17, 18, 19. The thoughts of his heart
are only evil continually, Gen.</hi> 6. 5. and
<hi>the earth is corrupt before God, and full of
cruelty,</hi> ver. 11.</p>
               <p>Thus the Soul, the Body, the Mind,
and the Manners of Men, the Nature of
Beasts and Fowls, and the Condition of
the Earth it self being wholly altered
from the Original Constitution, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the Contagion of Sacrilege, it
pleas'd the Justice of God to bring the
Flood upon the Earth, to sweep away all
the Posterity of wicked <hi>Cain,</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Generation; and not to spare any
either of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Line, or of Righteous
<hi>Seth</hi>'s Generation, and his Family, as a
Type of the Sacred Portion appropriated
to his Worship, which those Sinners of
the old World had so much corrupted.
Thus for <hi>Sacrilege</hi> was the whole World
destroy'd; in that Universal Destruction
was nothing saved, but the Tenth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
that out of it, as from a better
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48454:11"/>
Root, the New World might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and replenished.</p>
               <p>But the Coals of that old Ambition
(which before the Flood, being once fir'd
by Satan in the Hearts of our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
pricked them on in a Desire to be
like Gods) came by propagation of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Sin, to be kindled again after the
Flood, in the proud Builders of the Tower
of <hi>Babel,</hi> who by their miraculous Work
would also be like Gods; and by giving
themselves a Name upon Earth, live (as
it were) eternally; and withal, provide
so against the Hand of God, as they
would be no more in danger of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Go to,</hi> (say they) <hi>let us build us
a city and a towre, whose top may reach up
unto heaven, Gen.</hi> 11. 4. that we may
get <hi>us a name, lest we be scattered upon the
whole earth.</hi> These were the Giants spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

own immediate Hand, their Language
confounded, their Society broken; they
are cast out of their ancient Habitation,
and that which they most feared falleth
upon them; to be scattered over all the
face of the Earth, and to be bereaved of
their Friends and Kindred. For it is said,
they understood not <hi>labium proximi sui,</hi>
the Language of their Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and were thereby compelled to
leave them, as if they had been dead, and
their Familie extinct, and to associate
with those whom they did understand.</p>
               <p>Besides this, as there fell a grievous
Curse upon the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Cain</hi> for their Sacrilege, so (the <hi>Divines</hi>
observe) did there also upon the whole
Posterity of their Children, that is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole World. <hi>Hodiè mundus hanc
calamitatem sustinet,</hi> saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> The
whole World at this day, feeleth the
Evil of this Curse of the Confusion of
Languages; for by it the strongest Bond
of Humane Society and Concord is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the Hearts of Men alienated one
from another, their Means of Commerce
taken away, their Manners changed, and
their Minds, Thoughts, Studies, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spositions
contrary for the most part, and
repugnant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48454:12"/>
Sacrilege, being thus got up again,
bringeth forth immediately the other
Branches of Impiety: for <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the
proud Hunter, and chief Builder of the
Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> is not satisfied with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like a God, but is adored of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as a God indeed, and at length so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> under the Name
of <hi>Saturn,</hi> or <hi>Saturnus Babylonicus.</hi> So,
after him, is his Son, <hi>Jupiter Belus,</hi>
whom the Scripture calleth <hi>Bel, Baal,</hi>
and likewise many other of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Posterity, by whom the World
in a short time becometh full of Gods:
And though they daily saw these their
Gods to grow old and feeble, and to die
like Men, and to rot and putrifie like
the basest Creatures; yet such was their
Stupidity, that out of Wood and Metal
they framed their Images, and styling
those blockish Lumps by the Names of
Gods, erected Altars and Temples to
them; and honouring them with the
Rites of Sacrifices and Divine Worship,
belonging only to the True Living God,
did thus bring the Abomination of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
over all the World.</p>
               <p>How fearfully God punished this high
Kind of Sacrilege, appears abundantly in
the Book of <hi>Josuah</hi> and other Scriptures:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48454:12"/>
all the Kingdoms of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where it first
began to spread it self, were so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally

never any under the Sun were like unto

Gods in the House of <hi>Jacob,</hi> both against
his Will, and perhaps without his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
yet the Hand of God was so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his House, as that his Daughter <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>

are thus neglected? It is to be noted, That
as <hi>Micah</hi> expected a Blessing from God,
for entertaining an Idolatrous Levite into
his House; so <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Piety towards
his Priests, wanted not a Blessing from
God upon his House, though God hated
both the Idolaters and Idolatry it self.</p>
               <p>Let us see how <hi>Sacrilege</hi> in this Kind
hath been punished. The <hi>Benjamites</hi> of
<hi>Gibeah</hi> wronging a Levite villainously, in
abusing his Wife, <hi>Judg. 19. 25. Gibeah</hi>
is therefore destroyed with Fire and
Sword, above 26000 valiant Men of the
<hi>Benjamites</hi> slain, and the whole Tribe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

their Cities and Castles, <hi>Ch.</hi> 20.</p>

and makes himself other Priests, not of
the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> for this he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
by <hi>Abiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and
500000 of his Men slain, his Son taken
from him, and his Posterity threatned to

<hi>Jeroboam</hi> also stretched but out his hand

                  <p>Sacrilege of Function, by usurping the

               <p>
                  <hi>SAcrilege of Function</hi> is, when those
that are not called to the Office of
<hi>Priesthood</hi> or <hi>Ministry,</hi> do usurp upon it.
So <hi>Gideon</hi> made an <hi>Ephod,</hi> (that is a Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
Ornament of the Tabernacle) not
at <hi>Shilo,</hi> but in his own City <hi>Ophra,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>Israelites</hi> fell to worship it: or, as
others think, that he made all the things
of the Tabernacle, whereby the People
were drawn to worship there, and not
to go to <hi>Shilo,</hi> where the Tabernacle was.
This (saith the Text) was the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Gideon</hi> and his House; for his Son
<hi>Abimelech,</hi> rising against his Brethren,
slew 70 of them upon a Stone, and
then with a Stone cast upon him by a
Woman, himself was first brained, and
after by his own Commandment, thrust
through by his Page, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 27. and
9. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> takes upon him to offer a burnt

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48454:16"/>
The Kingdom therefore is cut from his
Family, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 9. and nothing after
prospers with him, but he runneth into
other Sins, as that of sparing <hi>Agag</hi> and
the Cattle. He is overthrown by the
<hi>Philistines,</hi> himself and three of his Sons
are slain by them, 1 <hi>Sam. 3. 6. Ishbosheth,</hi> a

               <p>
                  <hi>Vzzah</hi> being no <hi>Levite,</hi> stretched forth
his hand and stayeth the Ark from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
It seemed a pious Act, yet God
presently struck him dead for it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
6. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King, in spight of the
<hi>Priests,</hi> goeth into the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and
would burn Incense, which belonged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>Priest's Office.</hi> This (saith the
Text) was his Destruction, for he <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
against the Lord,</hi> therefore whilst
he was yet but about it, having the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
in his hand to burn it, <hi>the leprosie
presently rose in his forhead;</hi> so that he was
not only constrained to haste himself pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
out of the Temple, but to live all
his Life after sequestred from the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Men; and, being dead, was not

               <p>Let those that have <hi>Impropriations</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
whether these Cases concern not
them; for, like <hi>Vzzah,</hi> they stretch out
their hands to Holy Things, (but would
God it were to no worse intent) like
<hi>Gideon,</hi> they bring them into their own
Inheritance, and like <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Vzziah</hi>
they take upon them the <hi>Priest's

               <argument>
                  <p>Sacrilege of Holy Places, Churches, and
Oratories consecrated to the Honour and
Service of God: And the fearful Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
thereof shewed by many Examples.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>SAcrilege of the Place,</hi> is, when the
Temple or the House of God, or
the Soil that is consecrated to his Honour
is either violated or profaned. When
God was in the fiery Bush at <hi>Horeb,</hi> the
place about it was presently sanctified, so
that <hi>Moses</hi> himself might neither come
near the Bush, nor stand a-loof upon the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48454:17"/>
holy Ground with his Shooes on, but in
Reverence of the Place must be bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 5. So when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> his Presence
made the Place round about it Holy. He
commanded therefore that <hi>Marks</hi> should
be set upon the <hi>Border,</hi> to distinguish it
from the other Ground; and that if <hi>Man</hi>
or <hi>Beast</hi> did but <hi>touch</hi> it, they should be
either <hi>stoned,</hi> or <hi>thrust through with a dart,</hi>
Exod. 19. 21.</p>
               <p>Thus afore the Law; when the Law
was given, first the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and then
the <hi>Temple</hi> were full of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> both
by the <hi>Presence of God,</hi> and by the <hi>Decree
of his Mouth,</hi> as appeareth abundantly in
Scripture, <hi>Ex. 40. 34, 35. 1 King.</hi> 8. 10, 11.
Therefore grievous Punishments were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
inflicted upon such as did violate
them in any thing. <hi>If any man</hi> (saith the
<hi>Geneva</hi> Translation) <hi>destroy the temple of
God, him shall God destroy; for the temple
of God is holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 17. The <hi>Greek</hi> is
much more copious, and doth not restrain
it to them only that <hi>destroy</hi> the Temple,
but extendeth it to all that either <hi>destroy</hi>
or <hi>abuse</hi> it in any sort; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
The
vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> doth well express it; <hi>Si
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48454:18"/>
quis templum Dei violaverit, disperdet eum
Deus,</hi> &amp;c. for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpo,

well the lesser Injuries done to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as that great and Capital Crime of
destroying it: but because the Apostle
useth one word in both Places, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they likewise in the ...
would have one word in both places ...
Upon the word <hi>destroy,</hi> which to my
understanding is too particular, and might
have been better expressed by a word of
more general Signification; as to say, If
any Man spoil the Temple of God, God
shall spoil him; that is to say, If he spoil
the Temple, either by destroying it, or
defacing it, or violating it in any Course,
as by robbing, stealing, or taking from
it any Ornaments, ... Goods, Rights,
... Means of Maintenance, or by abusing
it in any manner whatsoever, God shall
spoil him in one sort or other, as of his
Patrimony, Lands, Goods, Liberty, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
Health, and Life it self; Children,
Family, and Posterity; and not so only,
but by casting also upon him divers fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Visitations and Misfortunes, more or
less, as in his Wisdom shall soon...
The word <hi>destroy</hi> is not properly said of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48454:18"/>
any Punishment that tendeth only to
work Amendment: and God doubtless
often spoileth a Man of the things he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
in, not to his whole Destruction,
but to awaken him to Amendment.</p>
               <p>Let us see in what manner God hath
punished this kind of <hi>Sacrilege</hi> among the
<hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the time of the Law, though fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Examples are not to be expected,
for that there was but one Temple of
God in both the Kingdoms of <hi>Judah</hi> and
... namely, that of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> built
by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and for the most part, p...
preserved in after Ages. Another there
was at <hi>Samaria</hi> which...builded
upon <hi>Mount Gerizim,</hi> like to that of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
by Licence of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,
and being afterward destroy'd by <hi>Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
King of <hi>Judah,</hi> gave occasion to the
<hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman to say unto Christ,
John 4. 20. <hi>Our Fathers worshiped in this
Mountain—.</hi> A third also for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
Jews in <hi>Aegypt</hi> built by <hi>Onias</hi> Son
of <hi>Onias</hi> the High-Priest, in the time of
<hi>Antiochus Epiphanes, Joseph. Antiq.</hi> l. 12.
c. 14. &amp; <hi>de Bello Judaico,</hi> c. 7. But
these two being against the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God (who would have no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
but at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) I meddle not with,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48454:19"/>
nor with the Synagogues of the <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many in every City, 480. in <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
instituted for Strangers, as the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was for the Citizens, and erected of
later time without any mention of them
in the Old Testament or Books Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal:
Let us see, I say, Examples of this
kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
the Tabernacle, by neglecting the
sanctified Fire of the Altar, and offering
Incense by strange and common Fire;
they were therefore devoured by strange
Fire sent upon them by the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi>
made a Sacrilegious Rapine upon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of the Lord, upon the Fat, and
upon the Flesh, and upon the Holy Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
polluting also the Sanctified Place,
with sacrilegious Adultery, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12.
God termeth this a dishonouring himself,
and saith (<hi>ver. 30.) Them that honour me, I
will honour; and they that despise me, shall
be despised.</hi> Hereupon, he threatneth,
<hi>First, To cut off the arm of Eli's Father's
house, (i. e.</hi> the Authority and Honour
of the Priesthood;) which was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when <hi>Solomon</hi> cast out <hi>Abiathar</hi> ...
of <hi>Eli,</hi> out of the Priest's Office,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48454:19"/>
and bestowed it on <hi>Zadock,</hi> being of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Family, 1 <hi>King. 2. 26. Secondly,
That all of his Family should die before they
came to be old;</hi> which himself did partly
see in his own Sons. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>his
sons</hi> Hophni <hi>and</hi> Phinehas <hi>should die both in
one day. Fourthly,</hi> That <hi>he should see his
enemy possess his office,</hi> and that <hi>the remnant
of his family should crouch, and be sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to him for relief and favour.</hi> All
which undoubtedly came to pass: And
yet with all this was not the Wrath
of God appeased; but spreading it self
into a further Agony of Indignation, fell
not only upon the whole People of <hi>Israel,</hi>
but also upon the holiest Monuments of
the Glory of God. The Word of the
Lord became rare and precious: There
was no manifest Vision: The Army of
<hi>Israel</hi> is beaten by the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and
about 4000 of them slain in one Battle,
and 30000 in another: The Ark of God
taken Prisoner, and carried Captive into
the House of <hi>Dagon,</hi> the <hi>Philistines</hi> Idol:
<hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> died: <hi>Eli</hi> falleth
backward and breaketh his Neck: The
Wife of <hi>Phinehas</hi> falleth untimely into
Travail, and dieth with Grief, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
chap. 2. 3, 4.) Fourscore and five Priests
of <hi>Eli</hi>'s House are, at <hi>Saul</hi>'s Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48454:20"/>
tyrannously slain all in one Day.
<hi>Nob</hi> the City of the Priests, with the
Men, Women, Children, Sucklings, Oxen,
Sheep, and Asses all destroyed (22. 18.)
And finally, to cut the Priesthood for
ever from the House of <hi>Eli, Solomon</hi> cast
<hi>Abiathar</hi> out of it (being the fourth in
Succession after <hi>Eli</hi>), and brought in <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock</hi>
of another Family, (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 8.)
Oh the dreadful Justice of Almighty
God! But such of old was the Fruit of
Sacrilege; and such Effects it still produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joash</hi> stoned <hi>Zachariah</hi> in the Court of
the Temple. This double Sacrilege of
Person and Place, was punished by the
Slaughter of his People, Loss of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Diseases of his Body, and Murther
of his Person, as we have already clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Sacrilege of the Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Vzziah</hi> entering the Sanctuary by

took away also much Spoil, which they
brought to <hi>Samaria.</hi> The <hi>Edomites</hi> also
beat him, and captivated his People; and
the <hi>Philistines</hi> took and inhabited many

of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> not belonging to the

Provision of the Sacrifices, but deposited
there in safety, for Widows and Orphans.
The high Priest <hi>Onias</hi> declareth to him,
that there was not above 400 Talents of
Silver, and 200 of Gold: and both he
and the rest of the Priests, and the rest
of the City, prayed instantly to God to
preserve the Treasury; notwithstanding
<hi>Heliodorus</hi> and his Souldiers approach
unto it, and presently there appeared a
terrible Man on Horse-back, richly barb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
between two young Men of notable
strength, and the Horse running fiercely
upon him, struck him on the Breast with
his Fore-foot, and the young Men scourged
him continually with many sore stripes: so
that <hi>Heliodorus</hi> falling to the Ground, and
covered with great Darkness, was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away in a Horse-Litter, desperate of

to give <hi>Onias</hi> thanks, because God for his

this, would have sent another, but <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus</hi>
advising him to send his Enemy
he gave it over, 2 <hi>Macc. 3. 38, 39. If thou

himself, whose Head, and the Hand with

Thus touching <hi>Local Sacrilege,</hi> I have
gone through the <hi>Canonical</hi> and <hi>Apochry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal</hi>
Books of the Old Testament; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I enter into the New, (which will
be very short) I desire to remember one
that happen'd in the mean time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great (whose Glory and
Conquest some in <hi>Plutarch</hi> compare with
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great) by help of <hi>Hyrcanus</hi>
taketh <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and battering down a
wall of the Temple, maketh there a great
slaughter, not only of the Jews, but of the
Priests themselves, that even then were at
the Sacrifices; and chused rather to die,
than to intermit the same; and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
with his Soldiers into the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
did behold those Sacred things, which
a profane eye never saw before, the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Table, the Candlestick, the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
Instruments, and what might
tempt a wastful General, 2000 Talents
of holy Treasure, which <hi>Pompey</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
to the Glory of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then-piety
would never touch, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that the Ministers should cleanse
the Temple presently, and continue their
daily Sacrifices, making <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> now
High-Priest. <hi>Josep. Antiqu. lib. 14. §.</hi> 8.
Hitherto all Glory and Fortune attended
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48454:24"/>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> his Servants, three times he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth,
and is as well Conqueror of the
Hearts of his Nation, as of their Persons
whom he subdued. Some in <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
where his Conquests are recited, compare
them with <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this <hi>Sacrilege</hi> (to my knowledge ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it) nothing doth prosper with him,
but as conducing to his hurt: <hi>Oh,</hi> (said
<hi>Plutarch, p. 70.) would God he had dyed
while his fortune was yet like</hi> Alexander's:
<hi>for in the rest of his Life his prosperities
were hateful, and his miseries bitter.</hi> He
hasteth home into <hi>Italy</hi> to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of his family and country, where
he findeth that his wise <hi>Mutia</hi> had played
the harlot, and therefore divorceth her;
that the Senate one while slight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
him, another while magnify him and
use him for necessity, but always suspect
him, in great opposition with the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Men; and when he had Married <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
the Daughter of <hi>Caesar</hi> to be reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him, she became abortive of her
first Child, and dyed of her second, and
the Child also, all in a short space. Then
runneth the dissension between <hi>Caesar</hi> and
him, which groweth to Arms on both
sides, and when <hi>Caesar</hi> at first had
the advantage, yet he offereth <hi>Pompey</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48454:24"/>
Conclusions of Peace; which <hi>Pompey</hi>
(ordained to destruction) refuseth, and
having at last by the confluence of Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and active Men unto him more than
double the Army of <hi>Caesar,</hi> besides an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Navy to secure him, he joyneth
Battle with great hope and probability of
Victory near <hi>Pharsalia</hi> in <hi>Thessaly,</hi> but is
overthrown, and flying to his great
Friend <hi>Ptolemy</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is there Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
murthered at his landing, in the
sight of his Wife and Son his Head
struck off, and his Body cast upon the
shore. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life admiring
whence this change of fortune should
come, supposes it to be for mis-governing
the Common-wealth; I by the precedent
Examples impute to his <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> which
after that manner wrought still upon his
posterity to the extirpation of his Family.
For his Son <hi>Cneus Pompeius</hi> overcome in
<hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Caesar,</hi> is slain also in fight, <hi>App.
lib.</hi> 2. And his other Son <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi>
driven out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> is there
slain by the commandment of <hi>Antonius.
App. lib.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Thus when <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great entred
into the Temple, and saw the great Riches
thereof, he did forbear to spoil or pillage
any part thereof, which makes for the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48454:25"/>
commendation of his heathenish piety.

               <p>But when <hi>Crassus</hi> the Roman General
entered <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Temple, he
did not forbear, but took away Eight

                  <hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> being the second time

with a mighty Army against the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
he came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and seeing
the Treasure of the Temple (which
<hi>Pompey</hi> forbare to meddle with) he took
away Two Thousand Talents of Money,
and all the Gold, amounting to Eight
Thousand and besides this, the Golden
Beam weighing 750 <hi>l.</hi> whereon the
Veils did hang. To say truth, the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Beam was deliver'd to him by <hi>Eleazar</hi>
the Priest, as a ransom for all the rest,
<hi>Crassus</hi> swearing to take nothing else. But
having the one, he would not leave the
other. The Beam he broke, and coin'd
it into Money for payment of the Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The success was this. Many grievous

and divers other such Prodigious
events are noted by <hi>Plutarch.</hi> Joining
Battle with his Enemy, his dear Son was
first slain in his own sight, with the
Flower of his Cavalry, and then all the
<hi>Roman</hi> Army slaughter'd or discomfited.
Himself, though <hi>Surenas</hi> the General
would have sav'd him, was also slain.
Being dead, his Head and his Hand,
(that committed the <hi>Sacrilege</hi>) like <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canor</hi>'s
in the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> were stricken off,
and with other Monuments of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Glory, most contemptuously abused
and derided, in Triumphs, Plays, and
Publick Meetings. It is noted to be one
of the greatest Overthrows that ever the

               <p>Some report, that the <hi>Parthians,</hi> in
derision of his Avarice, poured molten
Gold into his Mouth; and say also, that
he slew himself, by thrusting his riding-Wand
into his own Brains through his
Eye. But, I take it, he that thus killed
himself, was <hi>Pub. Crassus Nucianus,</hi>
Brother to the Grand-Father of this

Wars by <hi>Aristonicus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is much to be admired, that none
of the Heathen-Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Titus,</hi> (many of them being notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
wicked and prodigal) nor <hi>Gense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi>
and his <hi>Vandals,</hi> did not convert
such goodly rich Vessels of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as those of the Temple were, into
Ready Money, for the Maintenance of
their great Armies, and other publick
Necessities of State; but that they should
suffer them to be preserv'd without any
Loss or Imbezelling, for the Space of
500 Years together. But the Providence
of God is very remarkable in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, until they came to the great
Christian Emperour <hi>Justinian,</hi> who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
them to Christian Churches, as is
shewed.</p>
               <p>The Learned Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his <hi>Pis...
lib. 3. pag.</hi> 438. thinks that it is unknown
what became of these Vessels, after <hi>Titus</hi>
carried them to <hi>Rome.</hi> But it appeareth
he is mistaken in this; though not in his
Opinion, That the <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest</hi>
remain'd entire and untortur'd, till
all was destroy'd at the Captivity of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi>
though the outward Courts and
Chambers had been often plunder'd.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48454:26"/>
And if this be true, as it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
hence may we well consider, and
admire the wonderful Providence of God,
in defending the Temple in the principal
Parts of it, for the Benefit of his own
Worship and Glory, though he suffered
the outward to be plunder'd oftentimes,
for the Sins and Wickedness of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Though at last, when God resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to put an end to the Jews State and
Religion, then he suffer'd the Temple to
be burnt and destroyed utterly; never
suffering it to be built again, though it
were attempted divers times.</p>
               <p>But yet the gold and silver Vessels of the
Temple, (which were moveable things,
that might be carried away to another
Country, and at one time or other might
serve for some good Use and Purpose)
God preserv'd in all the Changes and
Transmigrations that hapned, till he
brought them at length to the Hands of
a Religious and Pious Emperour, who
bestow'd them upon Christian Churches,
even at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> from whence they
came.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi>
cometh into the World; and though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
it of all Kinds of Sins, he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48454:27"/>
not one, save only <hi>Sacrilege.</hi> He
refuseth to be Judge in parting the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
between the two Brethren, and
he would give no Sentence against the
Woman taken in Adultery; but in case
of <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> himself makes the Whip,
himself punisheth the Offenders, himself
overthrows the Money-Tables, and drives
out the Prophaners of the Temple, with
their Sheep, and their Oxen; not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the innocent Doves to remain, tho'
all these were for Sacrifices, and put in
the Court-Yard, <hi>John</hi> 2. 14. Such was
his Zeal in this Kind of Sacrilege, that he
refus'd not to be the Accuser, the Judge,

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48454:28"/>
his Head and his Hands were stricken off,
and such a Destruction and Death was
upon the People, that the very Cry of
the City went up to Heaven, and those
that were not slain were smitten with
Emrods, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 4. besides a Plague of
Mice that was upon them; consulting
therefore with their Priests, they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>The <hi>Bethshemites</hi> (whilst the Ark was

               <head>SOME ADDITIONS
UPON THE
Former Discourse:
BY
JEREMY STEPHENS.</head>
               <head>SECT. VIII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Some Annotations touching the Omissions of
the Presbyterians, in their late Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon the Bible; with some other
Passages.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE pious Author of this Discourse
intended to have added something
concerning the <hi>Sacrilege</hi> of <hi>Ananias</hi> and
<hi>Sapphira,</hi> and other places of the New
Testament; but since he did not finish
his Purpose, here shall follow, to supply
that Defect, some <hi>Annotations,</hi> that may,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48454:30"/>
in part, make some Recompence of that
Omission.</p>
               <p>And first the late Annotations upon
the Bible published <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1646. by
some Divines called <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> deserve
to be censured for their Omissions, and
dangerous insinuations: for in their expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of some remarkable Texts and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
concerning <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> they do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unworthily discharge their parts; in
that they never mention the principal
offence and Sin of <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
charged in the Text, and by all
Expositors both Ancient and Modern so
approved. As touching the <hi>Sacrilege</hi> of
<hi>Achan</hi> in the 6. and 7. Chapters of <hi>Josua,</hi>
which is so fully and remarkably set forth
by the Holy Ghost, and <hi>Achan</hi> so fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Punished and Condemned for it, as
might well strike a Terrour, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the People of that time, but of all Men
in succeeding Ages: for as the Apostle
saith, 1. <hi>Cor. 10. These things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for our Admonition, upon whom the
ends of the World are come.</hi> Yet these
Divines pass all over in general Terms,
not mentioning <hi>Sacrilege</hi> to be the great
Sin for which <hi>Achan</hi> and his family, and
also the People were so severely Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48454:31"/>
as is manifestly to be observ'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
these two Chapters.</p>
               <p>Next for the <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> offence of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar</hi>
in taking the Holy Vessels of the
Temple to drink wine in them at his
great feast, they so blanch it over in their
Notes <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 2. as if the principal Sin
had been drinking excessively; not profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the holy Vessels, whereas the Text
doth not charge him or his Nobles for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
drinking (though at so great a
feast some might perhaps offend therein)
but for the abuse of the Vessels, which
were not to be employed to any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or Prophane use, as they were not
all the time since <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> his
Grand-Father took them from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and put them into the
House of his Gods at <hi>Babylon—Cum
antehac in Beli Templo aliquam adhuc sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniam
retinuissent (ut not at Hieronymus in
Dan. 5.) Quod tunc piaculum fuit Sacra
profanare, nunc &amp; principum &amp; profanorum
lusus est, &amp; adhuc quaerimus, cur bellis tam
atrocibus vastitas passim fiat? melius cavit
sibi</hi> Justinianus <hi>qui vasa Templi secundi, à
Vespasiano Romam portata, à Genserico
Romae expilatore Carthaginem, cum per
victoriam nactus esset, non in suos vertit usus,
sed in sacram basilicam misit, quae erat</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48454:31"/>
Hierosolymis, <hi>narrante Procopio.</hi> Thus
the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> doth observe in his
Annotations upon this Text; and so
<hi>Calvin</hi> formerly, who saith expresly in
his Commentary, <hi>Profectò ista profanatio
indignissimum fuit Sacrilegium.</hi> So also
<hi>Rolloc</hi> and <hi>Willet</hi> in their Commentaries
upon <hi>Daniel,</hi> are very clear to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
all which might have directed them
who collected the Notes.</p>
               <p>It is not impertinent to note further
what became of these Vessels afterwards,
because some do think it is unknown;
for in regard they were Consecrated to
the Service of God, it appears that they
were preserved wonderfully by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Providence of God, both in the first
spoil of the Temple by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
and also in the final destruction by <hi>Titus:</hi>
For <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> having taken them,
did not put them into his Treasury, nor
convert them to private Uses, but placed
them in the House of his Gods at <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi>
and at the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> from
the Captivity, all the Vessels were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to the Temple, as appears in <hi>Ezra</hi>
and <hi>Daniel.</hi> So <hi>Titus</hi> also did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them to any private Use, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
many Years in the Capitol, until
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48454:32"/>
                  <hi>Gensericus</hi> the <hi>Vandal</hi> Sacked <hi>Rome,</hi> and
from thence among other Treasures car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and there also they
were preserved till <hi>Bel,</hi> the great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
under <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<hi>Carthage;</hi> and among the Riches
and Plunder that they won there, when
<hi>Gelimer</hi> the Fourth King, a Successor after
<hi>Gensericus,</hi> was taken, and other Riches
and great Spoils, he took and recovered
the Holy Vessels of the Temple, and
brought them to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to the
Emperor <hi>Justinian.</hi> When <hi>Justinian</hi> had
them he was informed by a <hi>Jew</hi> and
some others, that they were the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
Vessels of the Temple, and that
they would not prosper in any Man's
custody; and that for detaining of them
formerly <hi>Rome</hi> was conquered by <hi>Gense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus;</hi>
and note again <hi>Carthage</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
for the same Offence, as <hi>Procopius</hi>

               <p>When thus the Vessels were brought
to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and presented to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi>
the Emperor, he greatly feared,
and was very unwilling to convert them
to any private Use, or to his own Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury;
but upon advice sent them to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself of them, and would not be
guilty of any suspicion of Sacrilege.
Thus we may see in those Days there
was some Piety in the Hearts of Men
more than ... They took Example by
the Calamities of others, not to be too
bold with things Consecrated to God:
In a doubtful matter <hi>Justinian</hi> resolved
rather to imploy to some pious Uses, than
to enrich his own Coffers with them;
but had they come into the Hands of
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> in these times, and had any
such Men been in those Days, they
would have melted them into Money to
pay Souldiers.</p>
               <p>Likewise upon <hi>Acts</hi> 5. the Sacrilege
of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> in defrauding
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48454:33"/>
God of a part of that which they had
Consecrated to him, the Divines in
their Annotations omit the main Sin, and
dwell upon the Circumstances only, as
Hypocrisie, Vain-glory, Lying, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
and the like. But we must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between <hi>Ananias</hi> his Fact, and
the Manner and Circumstance thereof.
The Fact was Sacrilege in the manner
of doing, other Crimes attended as
Handmaids: It will be plain if we ask but
these two Questions; First what <hi>Ananias</hi>
did? The Text will make Answer, he
purloined of the holy Money; this was
his Fact. Ask Secondly, How and in
what manner he purloined? The Story
will tell us, dissembling and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
making an appearance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
This then was but the Manner
and Circumstance of his Fact, and so the
Species of the Fact was to be placed
therein, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> doth fully shew in
his Discourse upon this Text, and doth
further instance the Particulars accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to whom therefore I refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These two terrible Examples of God's
Judgments and Severities against Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege:
The first of</hi> Achan, <hi>in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Church of</hi> Israel, <hi>at their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48454:33"/>
first entrance into the Land of</hi> Canaan:
<hi>The other of</hi> Ananias, <hi>in the beginning
of the Christian Church, are so remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and so punctually urged by the
Holy Ghost, that they may well affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
all Men in succeeding Ages from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away, or seizing upon any part, or
parcel of that which is given and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated

               <p>
                  <hi>Leviticus</hi> 23. 33, 34. God commands
that the Fields of the Suburbs of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
Cities should not be sold, for it is
their perpetual Possession. The Fields
belonging to their Forty eight Cities,
were the Glebe-lands belonging to them
to keep their Cattle, therefore God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that these Fields should not be
sold upon any terms; which <hi>Calvin</hi> doth
truly expound in his Commentary, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q>
                     <hi>Hoc non modo in eorum gratiam sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitur,
sed quia totius populi interfuit,
dispositos esse quasi in excubiis, ubi locum

vetat Deus alienari, quia hoc
modo relictâ propriâ statione subinde aliò
migrâssent, hanc verò disceptationem non
accidere totius populi interfuit.</hi>
                  </q> The
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48454:34"/>
same Reason is good at this Day; for
the Ministers of the Gospel must have
Houses to live in, and some Glebe-lands
for the maintenance of their Cattle, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they cannot subsist and attend
their Duties. But our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
do say in their Notes, there was
something in practice contrary to this; as
if a bad practice, contrary to the express
Commandment, were sufficient to excuse
the Fault: The thing that they mean,
and mention is the particular Example of
<hi>Barnabas</hi> the <hi>Levite</hi> of the Countrey of
<hi>Cyprus</hi> (Acts 4. 37.) <hi>Having Land sold
it, and laid the Money at the Apostles feet.</hi>
But it is easily answered, that <hi>Barnabas</hi>
had that Land in the Countrey of <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
as <hi>Tyrannus</hi> saith, of which Countrey he
was: For many Jews that were dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and dwelt in other Countries, and
had Estates there, and yet came over at
the solemn Feast at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as now <hi>Barnabas</hi> did: And if the
Lands which he sold were in <hi>Judaea,</hi> yet
then it might be sold, because the Jews
Polity was at an end, and the old Law
of <hi>Moses</hi> did not bind any longer; <hi>Lex
quae Hebraeos certis finibus continebat, jam
soluta erat,</hi> as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
say upon <hi>x.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48454:35"/>
In the Four last Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 45. 1.</note>
the Prophet doth there publish a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Prophecy concerning the Christian
Church and State (it being never to be
fulfilled in the State and Church of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>)
There is appointed by God a
Division to be made of Land into three
Parts, whereof the first is an <hi>Holy Portion
of the Land as an Oblation to the Lord,</hi>
which should be imployed for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Temple, and for the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Priests and Levites: <hi>The
length whereof shall be 25000 Yards, and
the breadth shall be 10000. This shall be
Holy at the Borders thereof round about.</hi> A
second Part for the City and People;
and a third for the Prince. But for the
Holy Portion for the Temple and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
God commandeth expresly, <hi>That it
should not be alienated, exchanged, or sold
upon any pretence,</hi> Chap. 48. 14. These
Four Chapters of great concernment to
the Christian Church are passed over in
silence, and the principal Scope of them
altogether neglected: No marvel
they pass over the Apocryphal Books,
wherein are remarkable Examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sacrilege, as is already set forth in
this Discourse out of them. And tho'
the Books themselves are not accounted
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48454:35"/>
Canonical equal to the rest, yet for the
Historical Truths, concerning the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
and Sufferings of the Jews, there
is no question made of their Credit.</p>
               <p>The Authors therefore of the Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though in their Preface they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
all Sincerity and Fidelity, yet have
they failed in both very grosly; <q>They
solemnly attest the Divine Omniscience,
and profess with the blessed Apostle
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that they are <hi>not of those that
corrupt the word of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 17.
<hi>or who handle it deceitfully,</hi> Chap. 4. 2.
nor who wrest any part of it to the
Patronage of any Error of what deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
soever; nor have we added
to it (say they) any of our own precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Opinions to imprint a partiality
in our Expositions, nor taken from it,
or smothered the least tittle of sacred
Truth contained in it, nor yet have we
subtilly passed over any difficult place
with silence, as if it had no need of an
Annotation to clear it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But let the Reader judge whether it
appears not by these few Observations
touching Sacrilege (which is the crying
Sin of this Age) that they have dealt
very slightly and subtilly in passing over
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48454:36"/>
such remarkable Places with silence, and
smothering the Truth, which might
have been confirmed and inforced from
these pregnant Texts. They have plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovered their Double-dealing, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
and Forbearance to denounce
the Judgments of God against such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Sin, so raging and predominant
at this time. They have done like the
false Prophets of old that did sow Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and flatter the People in their evil
Courses; whereas Sacrilege is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one of the most hainous Sins of these
Days by the best Divines, and other
learned Men that have written thereof.</p>
               <p>The Apostle saith, Rom. 2. 22. <hi>Thou
that abhorrest Idols, dost thou commit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege?</hi>
The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
against all sorts of Idols, Images,
Pictures, and Crosses; but for Sacrilege
(unless it be for that of the Sabbath)
they are very sparing and silent. But
for the Apostles words; 'tis true (as one
doth well infer upon them) these words
are spoken as to the Person of an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Jew, and may be therefore
thought to aim only at those Sins, which
were described in the Law of <hi>Moses:</hi>
But do but view St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48454:36"/>
and you will quickly find they
come home to us Christians. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tells the Jew, that he taught others
those things which he would not do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and he strives to make this good by
three several Instances. First, <hi>Thou that
preachest a Man should not steal, dost thou
steal?</hi> Secondly, <hi>Thou that sayest a Man should
not commit Adultery, dost thou commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery?</hi>
In both these it is plain, that
the Jew he dealt with did the same
things he reprehended: And streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the third comes, <hi>Thou that abhorrest
Idols, dost thou commit Sacrilege?</hi> So that
hence it will follow (if St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words
have any Logick in them) that these
two Sins are of the self same Nature too;
and that to commit a Sacrilege is a breach
of the same Law, as to commit an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
so that the Crime will appear,
without all doubt, a plain Robbery of
God: For he that steals from Men, yea
though a whole Community of Men,
though <hi>bona universitatis,</hi> yet he sins but
against his Neighbour, 'tis but an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against the Second Table of the
Law, in these words, <hi>Thou shalt not

brought a just Punishment upon

rise amongst his Soldiers in the Night

this, a grievous Plague at last ...
in his Army, accompany'd with many
fierce Diseases that drave his Men into
Frenzies and Forgetfulness; so that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up and down the Army, they flew
upon every Man they met with. And
no Physick could help them; for they
were taken so suddenly, and with such
Violence, as they dy'd within five or

for fear of the Infection. Hereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued

assail them both by Sea and Land; they
invade their Forts and their Trenches,
fire their Navy, and (to be short) make
a general Confusion of the whole Army.

by Night back into <hi>Carthage,</hi> and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Oblations to his prophane Expences, is
thus driven to an ignominious Flight,
chusing rather to live basely, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd

wicked <hi>Sacrilege</hi> by a deserved Death.
But he came to such Misery, that he
went up and down the City in a most

and imploring at length some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital

still forc'd them to go on, and to make

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48454:42"/>
is most remarkable, both for the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Sacrilege and Punishment. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Relation perhaps shall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing,
I will presume to be a little the
longer in it. The General Senate (of
the chiefest part of <hi>Greece</hi>) called the
<hi>Amphictyon,</hi> imposed a grievous Fine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Phoceans;</hi> for that they had taken
a piece of the Ground <hi>Cirrhaea,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and had profaned it to
works of Husbandry; adding further,
that if the Fine were not paid to the use
of <hi>Apollo,</hi> their Territories should be
consecrate unto him. The <hi>Phoceans</hi>
nettled with this Decree, as not able to
pay the Fine, and chusing rather to die
than to have their Countrey proscribed;
by the Counsel of <hi>Philomelus,</hi> they protest
against the Decree of the <hi>Amphictyones,</hi> as
most Unjust, that for so small a piece of
Ground so excessive a Fine should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
and pretend that the Patronage
of the Temple of <hi>Delphos</hi> it self (where
the famous Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> was) did of
Antiquity and Right belong unto them;
and <hi>Philomelus</hi> undertaketh to recover it.
Hereupon the <hi>Phoceans</hi> make him their
General; he presently draweth into his
Confederation the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> (whom
the <hi>Amphictyones</hi> had bitten with the like
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48454:42"/>
Decree) and with an Army on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
invadeth and possesseth the Temple of
<hi>Delphos,</hi> slaying such of the City as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
him. The same hereof flew far
and wide; and upon it divers Cities of
<hi>Greece</hi> undertake in their Devotion a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
way against the <hi>Phoceans</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, They of <hi>Locris</hi> give them Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and are overcome. Then the <hi>Boeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
prepare an Army for their Aid;
but in the mean time <hi>Philomelus,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to defend his Possession of the Temple,
encloseth it with a Wall: And though he
had formerly publish'd through <hi>Greece,</hi>
that he sought nothing but the Patronage;
yet seeing many Cities to joyn in force
against him, he now falleth apparently
upon spoiling of the Temple for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
of his War, taking from it an
infinite Wealth in precious Vessels and
Oblations. Nor did the progress of his
Fortune suddenly teach him to repent
it; for he prevail'd still against the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crians,
Boeotians, Thessalians,</hi> and other
their Confederates, till the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> at
last, overthrew his sacriligeous Army,
and slaying a great part thereof, drove
himself to that necessity, that to avoid
the Tortures incident to his Impiety, he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48454:43"/>
threw himself headlong down a Rock,
and so miserably ended his wicked Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onomarchus</hi> (his Partner in the Sacrilege)
succeedeth in his room of Command and
Impiety; and after variety of Fortune,
his sacrilegious Army is overthrown by
King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon;</hi> and by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Soldiers, that were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
were drown'd, and <hi>Onomarchus</hi>
himself, as a Sacrifice to his Sacrilege,
hang'd.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Phayllus,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Ono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchus,</hi>
is chosen General; who rotting
by little and little whilst he lived, died
at length in most grievous Torture for
his Sacrilege, <hi>pag.</hi> 437.</p>
               <p>After him succeeded <hi>Phaloecus,</hi> Son of
<hi>Onomarchus,</hi> who beyond all the former
Sacrilege (wherein some accounted
that as much was taken, as the whole
Treasure was worth that <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great brought out of <hi>Persia</hi>) added
this, That hearing there was an infinite
Mass of Gold and Silver buried under
the Pavement of the Temple, he with
<hi>Philon,</hi> and other of his Captains began
to break up the Pavement near the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos;</hi>
but frighted suddenly with an
Earthquake, durst proceed no further,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48454:43"/>
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 453. Shortly after, <hi>Philo</hi> is accused
for purloining much of the Sacred Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
committed to his Dispensation; and
being Tortur'd nameth many of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts,
who with him are by the <hi>Phoceans</hi>
themselves all put to terrible Death,
(<hi>pag.</hi> 452.) And the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> by the
aid of king <hi>Philip,</hi> put to flight divers
Troops of the <hi>Phoceans,</hi> whereof 500
fled for Sanctuary into a Chapel of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>'s,
seeking Protection under him, whose
Temple they had so violated. But the
Fire they left in their own Tents fired
their Cabbins; and then taking hold of
Straw that lay near the Chapel, burnt
it also, and in it them that were fled into
it. For the God (saith <hi>Diodorus</hi>) would
give them no Protection, though they
begged it upon their Knees, <hi>p.</hi> 45, 3.</p>
               <p>Now after ten Years this sacred War
came to an end. <hi>Phaloecus,</hi> not able to
subsist against <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Boeotians,</hi>
compoundeth with him for Licence to
depart, and to carry the Soldiers he had
about him with him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phoceans,</hi> without all means to
resist, are by a New Decree of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phictyons,</hi>
or Grand Council, adjudged to
have the Walls of three of their Cities
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48454:44"/>
beaten to the Ground; to be excluded
from the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the
Court of the <hi>Amphictyons</hi> (that is, to
be Excommunicate and Out-lawed;) to
keep no Horses nor Armour, till they
had satisfied the Money, sacrilegiously
taken, back to the God; that all the
<hi>Phoceans</hi> that were fled, and all others
that had their Hands in the Sacrilege,
should be duly punish'd, and that every
Man might therefore pull them out of
any place; that the <hi>Graecians</hi> might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all the Cities of the <hi>Phoceans</hi> to the
Ground, leaving them only as Villages
of fifty Houses a-piece, distant a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the one from the other to inhabit;
that the <hi>Phoceans</hi> should retain their
Ground, but should pay a yearly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of Sixty thousand Talents to the
God, till the Sum mentioned in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters
of the Temple, at the beginning
of the Sacrilege were fully satisfied,
<hi>pag.</hi> 455.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> also and <hi>Athenians,</hi>
who aided the <hi>Phoceans,</hi> had their part
(and justly) in the Punishment. For
all the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Soldiers that were
at the spoil of the Oracle, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
slain by the <hi>Lucans, (pag. 458.)</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48454:44"/>
and all others universally (saith <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>)
not only the principal Agents in the
Sacrilege, but even they that had no
more than their Finger in it, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
by the God with inexpiable Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<hi>pag.</hi> 456.</p>
               <p>Nor did <hi>Phaloecus</hi> escape it, though he
compounded with <hi>Philip,</hi> and lived long
after. For his long Life was no Happiness
unto him, but an extension of his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
living perpetually in Wandring up
and down, perplexed with restless Fears,
and variety of Dangers; till at last, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging
<hi>Cydonia,</hi> and applying Engines to
batter it, Lightning falling upon them
consum'd both them and him, and a
great part of his Army: Yet others say,
that he was slain by one of his Soldiers,
<hi>pag. 485. Diodor.</hi> lib. 16.</p>
               <p>The residue of his Army, that esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

hired to serve against their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Elis;</hi> but the <hi>Arcadians</hi> joyning
with the <hi>Eleans</hi> overthrew their Exiles,
and this their Army of sacrilegious Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
and having slain many of them,
divided the rest (being about 4000)
between them. Which done, the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
sold their part to be Bond-men;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48454:45"/>
but the <hi>Eleans,</hi> to expiate the spoil of
<hi>Delphos,</hi> put all their part to the Sword.
Many also of the noblest Cities of <hi>Greece</hi>
(that had aided the <hi>Phoceans</hi>) being
afterwards overcome by <hi>Antipater,</hi> lost
both their Authority and Liberty. And
besides all this, the Wives of the prime
Men of <hi>Phocis,</hi> that had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Jewels of the Gold of <hi>Delphos,</hi>
were also punished by an immortal
Hand: For she that had got the Chain,
offer'd by <hi>Helenes,</hi> became a common
Strumpet; and she that adorn'd her self
with the Attire of <hi>Eriphyle</hi> (taken
thence) was burnt in her House by her
eldest Son, stricken Mad, and firing
the same.</p>
               <p>These fearful Punishments fell on
them that were guilty of misusing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Things: Whereas on the other
part, <hi>Philip</hi> the King (that at this
time had nothing but <hi>Macedon</hi>) by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the Cause of the Temple and
Oracle, came after to be King of all
<hi>Greece,</hi> and the greatest King of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>

of <hi>Gauls,</hi> invaded <hi>Greece,</hi> and prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there victoriously, came at length
to <hi>Delphos,</hi> with an Hundred and fifty
thousand Foot, and Fifty thousand Horse;
where his Army endeavouring to spoil
the Temple standing upon the Hill <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassus,</hi>
was in scaling of it valiantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by Four thousand Citizens. But
suddenly an Earthquake tearing off a
great part of the Hill, threw it vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
upon the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who being so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed,
a Tempest of Hail and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
followed, that consumed them.
<hi>Brennus,</hi> astonished at the Miracle, and
tormented at the Wounds he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
slew himself with his Dagger,
<hi>Just. l. 24. p.</hi> 233.</p>
               <p>Another of the Captains, with Ten
thousand of the Soldiers that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
made all the haste they could out
of <hi>Greece:</hi> but their Flight was little
Benefit unto them. For in the Night
they durst come in no Houses, and in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48454:46"/>
the Day they wanted neither Labour,
nor Dangers. Abundance of Rain, and
Frost, and Snow, and Hunger, and
Weariness, and the extreme Want of
Sleep, consumed daily this miserable
Remnant: and the Nations they pass'd
through, pursu'd them as Vagabonds
to prey upon them. So that of that
numerous Army, which of late in the
Pride of their Strength despised and
spoiled the Gods, none was left to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their Destruction.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Justin</hi> affirmeth: but <hi>Strabo</hi>
saith, That divers of them returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Country (being <hi>Tolouse</hi> in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi>)
and that the Plague there falling
amongst them, the Sooth-sayers told
them, they could not be deliver'd from
it, till they cast the Gold and Silver
they had gotten by their Sacrilege, into
the Lake of <hi>Tolouse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About Two hundred and forty Years
after, <hi>Q. Servilius Cepio,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
taking the City of <hi>Tolouse,</hi> took also
this Treasure, (then being in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as seemeth by <hi>Aul. Gellius,</hi> lib. 3.
cap. 9.) and much encreas'd by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
out of their private Wealth, to
make the Gods more propitious unto
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48454:46"/>
them. The Gold (saith <hi>Strabo</hi>) amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a Hundred and ten <hi>Minas,</hi> and
the Silver to One thousand Pound in
Weight. In truth (saith <hi>Strabo</hi>) this
Sacrilege was the Destruction both of
<hi>Cepio</hi> himself and of his Army; and
<hi>Gellius</hi> addeth, That whosoever touch'd
any of that Gold, perished by a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and torturing Death. Hereupon
came the Proverb, which this Day is so
usual among Scholars, <hi>Aurum habet To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losanum;</hi>

him that is afflicted with great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

Fatalities it brought upon the Offenders

with an Hatchet. <hi>Ceres</hi> striketh him
with an unsatiable and perpetual Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
nothing doth satisfie him, nothing
fills him, nothing thrives with him;
all his Wealth is consumed on his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
And when all is gone, then he is
driven to dishonest Shifts, and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

own Daughter to one for an Horse, to
another for a Bird, to a third for an

this is also devoured, his Hunger, at
last, compelleth him to tear his own
Flesh with his Teeth, and by consuming
himself in this horrible manner to finish
his Days most miserably.</p>

King of <hi>Mees,</hi> or <hi>Austrasia,</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
wrongfully a Town from <hi>Franco</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Aquis</hi> pretending that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the publick Revenue, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially,
before the King and other
Judges, doth recover it with Three
hundred Crowns (<hi>aureos</hi>) Damages.
The Bishop, in great anguish of Mind,
goeth to the Church, and falling down
at the Tomb of St. <hi>Metrias,</hi> Patron of
the Church, prayeth for Vengeance, and
threatneth the Saint, that there should
be neither Lights nor Singing in that
Church, until he were revenged of his
Enemy, and the Things restored that
were taken away from it so wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And laying Thorns upon the Tomb,
he shut the Church Door, laying others
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48454:52"/>
there also (for that was a Type that the
place was forsaken.) Presently here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Chilperic,</hi> that had done this wrong
to the Church, falleth sick of a Fever,
and continueth so for a whole Year,
eating little and drinking little, save
Water in the heat of his Fit; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
in his Mind, and Sighing much,
yet Relented not in that he had done.
In the mean time all the Hair, both of
his Beard and Head, came wholly off,
and all his Head became bare and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
Then he bethinks him of the
wrong he had done to the Church, and
restoreth the Town with Six hundred
Crowns, for the Three hundred he had
received; hoping so to recover his
Health, by the means of the Saint, but
dy'd notwithstanding. <hi>Greg. Turon. De

the third King of <hi>Kent</hi> after
<hi>Ethelbert,</hi> had done great Injury to a
Noble Woman, called <hi>Domneva</hi> (the
Mother of St. <hi>Mildred</hi>); in Recompence
whereof the King promised, upon his
Honour, to give her whatsoever she
would ask of him. She begged upon
this so much Ground of him to build
an Abbey on, as a tame Deer (that she
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48454:53"/>
had nourished) would run over at a
Breath. The King had presently granted
it, but that one of his Council, named
<hi>Timor,</hi> standing by blamed his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that would upon the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Course of a Deer depart with any

(saith the Author, <hi>William Thorne,</hi> a
Monk of St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s) the Earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
and swallowed him up alive; in
Memory whereof the place till this time
was call'd <hi>Timor</hi>'s Lease. It may be
the Monk hath aggravated the matter,

it Fabulous; but it seems some notable
Misfortune followed upon <hi>Timor,</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,

of Religion in the beginning of our

doubteth but that in the first Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Heathen People, God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to shew some Miracles upon sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious
Impediments. The Story goes
on, that the King moved with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
granted <hi>Domneva</hi>'s Petition; and
that the Hind being put forth, run the
space of Forty eight Plough-lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, in making the
Forest of <hi>Ytene,</hi> commonly called the
<hi>New-Forest,</hi> is reported to have destroy'd
twenty six Towns, with as many Parish-Churches,
and to have banished both
Men and Religion for thirty Miles in
length, to make room for his Deer. He
had ruined also some other Churches in
<hi>France</hi> upon occasion of War; and in
Lent-time, in the fourth Year of his
Reign, he rifled all the Monasteries of
<hi>England</hi> of the Gold and Silver, which
was laid up there by the richer of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48454:63"/>
People to be protected by the Sanctity
of the Places, from Spoil and Rapine;
and of that also which belonged to the
Monasteries themselves, not sparing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Chalices or Shrines. But he, that
in the like Attempt met with <hi>Heliodorus,</hi>
in the second of <hi>Machab.</hi> 3. met with him
also grievously, both in his Person and
Posterity.</p>
                  <p>Touching his Person, as God raised
<hi>Absalom</hi> against <hi>David,</hi> so raised he <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> against his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Conqueror, and fought a Battle
with him by the Castle of <hi>Gerborie</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> where the Conqueror himself was
unhorst, his Son <hi>William</hi> wounded, and
many of their Family slain. Hereupon
the Conqueror (as casting Oyl into the
Fire of God's Wrath that was kindled to
consume his own Family) cursed his
Son <hi>Robert,</hi> which to his dying Day
wrought fearfully upon him, as shall by
and by appear. But to proceed with the
Conqueror himself, it is very Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that being so great and renowned a
King, he was no sooner Dead, but his
Corps was forsaken of his Children, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
Friends, Servants and Followers,
and wickedly left (saith <hi>Jo. Stow</hi>) as a
barbarous Person, not one of his Knights
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48454:64"/>
being found to take care of his Exequies:
So that a Countrey Knight, out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
was moved to take care thereof,
and conveying the Corps to <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
the Abbots and Monks of St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens,</hi>
there with the rest of the Clergy
and Laity of the Town, met it reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but in conducting it to the Church,
a terrible Fire broke out of an House,
and spreading suddenly over a great part
of the Town, the whole Company was
disperst, and only the Monks left to end
the Office begun. The Funeral notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
proceeded afterwards in great
Solemnity; the Bishops and Abbots of
<hi>Normandy</hi> attending it: But when the
Mass was done, and that the Bishop of
<hi>Ebroscen,</hi> at the end of his Sermon, had
desired all that were present to pray for
the dead Prince, and charitably to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
him, if he had offended any of
them; one <hi>Anselm Fitz-Arthur,</hi> rising up,
said aloud, <hi>The Ground whereon ye stand
was the floor of my Father's House, and the
Man for whom ye make Intercession took it
violently from him while he was Duke of</hi>
Normandy, <hi>and founded this House upon
it: I now therefore claim my own, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid

my Inheritance.</hi> The Bishops and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
hearing this, and understanding it
to be true by the Testimony of others,
presently compounded with the Party in
fair manner, giving him 60 <hi>s.</hi> in Hand
for the place of Burial, and promising a
just Satisfaction for the rest; for which
he received afterwards a 100 <hi>l.</hi> in Silver
by consent of <hi>Henry</hi> the Conqueror's Son.
This Blur being thus wiped away, they
proceeded to put the Corps into the
Tomb or Coffin, prepared by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whereupon another followed very
loathsome; for it being too short and
strait, as they strove violently to thrust
the Corps into it, the fat Belly, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Boweled, burst in pieces, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poured
forth so horrible a savour, as the
smoak of Frankincense, and other Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
ascending plentifully from the
Censers, prevail'd not to suppress it, but
both Priest and Company were driven
tumultuously to dispatch the Business,
and get them gone. Thus much of the
Disasters touching the Person of the
Conqueror. To which may be added,
that his very Death proceeded from a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
Accident happening unto him in
the Sacking of <hi>Medant,</hi> where the heat
and heaviness of his Armour, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48454:65"/>
clamor upon his Soldiers, wrought,
as was reported, a Dissolution of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails
(<hi>à ruina intestinorum ejus liquefacta,</hi>
saith <hi>Gemeticensis</hi>) for tho' he liv'd a while
after, yet he languish'd till his Death.
But note, by the way, that he who had
in his Life-time destroy'd so many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Burying-places, being dead, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he were so great a King, yet he
wanted the Office of his Children, Friends
and Servants, to carry him to Church, or
to take care of his Burial; that being
carried thither by others, the very Fire
wherewith he had devoured certain
Churches, interrupted his Passage; that
being come to the Church, he that had
put so many by their places of Burial,
was now put by his own: And lastly,
that when the place of his Burial was
obtain'd for Money, it happened (fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally)
that it was too strait to receive
him, as tho' the Earth of the Church
(which he had so grievously injured)
were unwilling to open her Mouth to
entertain him. But after all difficulties,
Did he not rest quiet at last? Reason
would he should; for the Grave is <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Requiei,</hi> the Sanctuary of Rest, and
he did enjoy it for many Ages: Yet the
Bishop of <hi>Bajeux,</hi> in the Year 1542. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48454:65"/>
his Tomb, and brought to light
his Epitaph hidden in it, Graven upon a
Gilded-plate of Brass. But in the Year
1562. certain <hi>French</hi> Soldiers, with some
<hi>English,</hi> that under the Conduct of the
<hi>Chastillon</hi> took the City of <hi>Caen,</hi> and
fell to spoiling of Churches there, did
barbarously break down, and deface the
Monument of this great King, and (as
tho' the <hi>Malus Genius</hi> of the Churches,
which himself had destroy'd, still pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
him with Revenge) did take out
his Bones and cast them away. <hi>Verst.</hi>

thus rifled Churches, appeareth not, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity

But the lamentable end of the <hi>Chastillon</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To come to his Posterity; his Sons

of <hi>England;</hi> first by his Brother <hi>William,</hi>
then by his Brother <hi>Henry,</hi> who also took
from him his Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> put
out his Eyes, and kept him cruelly in

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48454:66"/>

to this <hi>Norman</hi> Family. Here I must
observe (as elsewhere I have done) that
about the very same point of time; <hi>viz.

the holy Things of the Temple:
About the very same point of time, I
say, after the Conqueror had made this

Issue Male, and gave his Kingdom to
another Nation, not of <hi>Normandy</hi> but

so imperiously in <hi>England,</hi> as there was

into <hi>England,</hi> slew the Archbishop,
at Even Song, in his Cathedral Church,
at the very Altar, embruing it with his
Blood and Brains, committing at once this
horrible Murder and tripple Sacrilege:
First, in respect of the Person; secondly,
of the Place; and thirdly, of the Time
and Business then in hand. Yet Vengeance
seized not presently on their Bodies, but
tormented their Souls upon the rack of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48454:73"/>
Desperation; so that neither trusting
themselves one with another, nor the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Woods, nor the mantle of Night,
they fled into several Countries, where
they all within four Years after (as 'tis
reported) died miserable Fugitives, saith

                  <p>Touching their Issue; I find that <hi>Fitz-Vrs</hi>
fled into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and I heard there
that the <hi>Wild-Irish,</hi> and Rebellious Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Mac-Mahunde,</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> Parts,
is of that Lineage. The Family of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them is, at this Day, prosecuted
with a Fable (if it be so) that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Memory of this Impiety; for in
<hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> it is yet reported that
wheresoever any of them Travelleth the
Wind is commonly in their Faces.</p>

printed at <hi>Paris An.</hi> 1495. saith,
The Murderers, after this Horrible Fact,
rode that Night to a Manour of the
Archbishops, named there (corruptly)
<hi>Sumantingues</hi> forty Miles (<hi>Leucas</hi>) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from <hi>Canterbury, lib. 3. c.</hi> 20. and
that being Men of great Possessions, active
Soldiers, and in the strength of their Age,
yet now they became like Men beside
themselves, stupid, amaz'd and distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
repenting entirely of what they had
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48454:73"/>
done, and for Penance took their way to
the <hi>Holy-Land.</hi> But Sir <hi>Will. Tracy</hi> being
come to the City of <hi>Cossantia,</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi>
and lingring there, fell into an horrible
Disease; so that the parts of his Body rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
whilst he lived, and his Flesh being
dissolved by the Putrefaction, himself did,
by piece-meal, pull it off, and cast it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
leaving the Sinews and Bones ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.
In this misery this wretched
Murderer (as it was testified by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of that City, who was then his
Confessor) ended his Days, but very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently.
His other Complices lived not
long after, for all the four Murderers
were taken away within three Years after
the Fact committed. <hi>Dicti. Libri.</hi> lib. 4.

Par.</hi> who in <hi>An.</hi> 1209. reporteth thus,
That King <hi>John,</hi> doubting the Fidelity of
his Nobles, sent a Troop of Soldiers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of them their Sons, or Nephews, or
near Kinsmen for Hostages. Coming to
<hi>Will. Bruce</hi>'s and demanding his Sons, the

is generally well known: Yet I find
not, that either he destroyed or profaned
any of them, otherwise than by rifling of
their Wealth, and persecuting the Clergy
as his Enemies. To say truth, they were
not his Friends. But the last Riot that
he committed among them, was in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
and <hi>Norfolk</hi> as he brought his Army
that way to waste the Lands of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
his Enemies, and to pass by the
Town of <hi>Lyn</hi> (which stood faithful to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48454:76"/>
him when the most of <hi>England</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken

<hi>So that it was judg'd</hi> (saith the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
<hi>to be a punishment by God, that the Spoil
which had been gotten, and taken out of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
should perish and be lost by such means,
together with the Spoilers.</hi> Stow reporteth,
<hi>That the Earth opened in the midst of the
Waves, on the Marsties, and the Whirlpit
of the deep, so swallowed up both Men and
Horses, that none escaped to bring King</hi> John
<hi>Tidings:</hi> For he with his Army, going
before, escap'd (more happily than <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>)
but very narrowly with his Life,
especially if it were any Happiness to live
in that miserable Condition he was now
brought to, having lost his Treasure and
Fortunes at the very time, wherein, above
all other, he had most need of them, as
flying from his Enemy, <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> call'd in by his Subjects to

Cities of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Winchester,</hi> with

had subdued all <hi>Northumberland,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

this, I say, it were any Happiness to live,
yet enjoy'd he that miserable Happiness
but a very short time; for whether by
Poyson given him at <hi>Swinsted-Abbey,</hi> as the
common report is, or by a Surfeit taken
with eating Peaches, accompany'd with
an intolerable Grief for his Losses, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
deliver it; he died about five or six
Days after at <hi>Newark-Castle,</hi> and wanting
all civil Lamentation; was presently so

did among others besiege the Priory

Yet by raising a Wooden-Tower close by

                  <p>King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. in the zeal of his Religion<note place="margin">Edw. 1.</note>
(his Father yet living) took the Cross up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him and went to assist the Christians in
the Wars of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The Pope, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of his Charges, granted unto
him in the second Year of his Reign (he
being return'd) the tenth part of all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48454:80"/>
Benefices of the Kingdom for
one Year, and the like to his Brother <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
for another. But afterwards the
King forgetting his old Devotion, in the
11th Year of his Reign, seiz'd all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Tenths collected for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and laid up in divers places of the
Kingdom, and breaking open the Locks,
caus'd it to be brought unto him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
it to his own use. <hi>Stow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This taste of things separate to God,
drew him on to a further Appetite. In
the 23d Year of his Reign, he took into
his hands all the Priories Aliens through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom;<note place="margin">There were at that time, about 110.</note> committing them (as
<hi>Charles Martel</hi> of old had done in <hi>France</hi>)
to Officers under him; and allowing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Monk <hi>18d.</hi> a Week, retain'd the rest
for the charge of his War, as he did also
the Pensions going out of those Houses to
the greater Monasteries beyond the Seas.
Yet obtain'd he further, in the same Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
of the Clergy and Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
a Subsidy of half their Goods, to the
value of <hi>100000l.</hi> whereof the Abby of
<hi>Bury</hi> paid 655 <hi>l. 11d. q. Stow, ib. p.</hi> 316.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Ed.</hi> l. being in great want, by his
subduing <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the end of the
23th Year of his Reign, caused all the
Monasteries of <hi>England</hi> to be search'd, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48454:80"/>
the Money found in them to be brought
to <hi>London. Wals. pa. 65. Cax. l. 7. c.</hi> 39.
Shortly after, in the 24th Year of his
Reign, at a Parliament at <hi>St. Edmundsbury,</hi>
he required a Subsidy, which the Laity
granted. But the Clergy (pretending,
that Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> at the same time, had
forbidden upon pain of Excommunication,
that either Secular Princes should impose
Tallages upon the Church-men, or that
Church-men should pay any) they refus'd
to supply the King's Necessity; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
day to advise better on the matter
till the next Parliament at <hi>London</hi> shortly
after, they persisted in the same mind.
Whereupon the King put them out of his
Protection; so that being robb'd and
spoil'd by lewd persons without remedy,
to redeem the King's Favour, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>York</hi> and many of the Bishops
laid down a fifth part of all their Goods
in their Churches; and some by other
courses satisfy'd the King's desire, and so
recover'd his Protection. But all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries
within the Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
were seiz'd into the King's hands,
and Wardens appointed in them to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to the Monks and Religious Persons
therein only what must be had of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity;
taking all other Monies and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plusage
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48454:81"/>
to the King's use. So that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots
and Priors were glad to follow the
Court and to repair their Error with the
fourth part of their Goods. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> after all this, fearing
the Pope's Excommunication, continu'd
in his refusal, lost all he had, was forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of his Servants, forbidden to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
either in any Monastery or without,
and rested in the House of a poor Man,
only with one Priest and one Clerk. How
these Courses were censur'd <hi>in foro coeli,</hi> is
not in me to judge; nor will I pry into
the Ark of God's Secrets. But see what
followeth in the Story.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> having with great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
subdu'd <hi>Scotland,</hi> and taken the
King Prisoner, did at this present peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
enjoy that Kingdom, and govern'd
it by his own Officers. But e're three
Months came to an end, <hi>Wil. Wallis</hi> began
such a Rebellion there as put all in hazard;
and in fine, it was so reviv'd by <hi>Robert le
Bruce</hi> the King's natural Subject, that at
length he overthrew the King's Armies,
slew and beat out his Officers, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all recovery gain'd the Kingdom to
himself and his Posterity. King <hi>Edward</hi>
attempting the recovery, died at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of <hi>Scotland.</hi> His Son <hi>Edward</hi> II.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48454:81"/>
pursuing his Father's intent with one of
the greatest Armies that ever was raised
by the <hi>English,</hi> was miserably beaten and
put to flight, hardly escaping in his own
person. All his Life after full of Tumult;
not only his Nobles but his very Wife,
his Enemy; abandoned of his Subjects,
turn'd out of his Kingdom, imprison'd,
and traiterously murther'd. In all which,
the Curse which his Father upon his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
laid upon him if he should break the
Precepts he gave him had no doubt a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation;
for he observ'd none of them.</p>
                  <p>Touching the pulling of Lands from
the Church, all have not always been of
one mind. For tho' the makers of the
Statute of <hi>Mortmaine</hi> did truly think that
the Clergy had so disproportionable a share
by way of excess in the Lands of the
Kingdom; yet when in 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> II. it
came to the point, that the Order of the
Templars for their wickedness was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown;
the Parliament then (wherein
many of those, no doubt, that made the
Statute of <hi>Mortmain</hi> were present) would
not give the Lands and Possessions of the
Templars to the King or the Lords of
whom they were holden; but ordain'd
that they should go to the Order of the
Hospital of St. <hi>John's of Jerusalem,</hi> then
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48454:82"/>
lately erected for the defence of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and the Christian Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward le Bruce,</hi>

He thus prevailing, and the <hi>Irish</hi> much
revolting to him, the Archbishop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh</hi>
blesseth and encourageth the <hi>English</hi>

1337, Regni</hi> 12. (partly fearing that they
might hold intelligence with his Enemies,
but seeking chiefly to have their Wealth
toward the payment of his Soldiers) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated
their Goods and Possessions, letting
their Priories and Lands to farm for Rent,
and selling some of them right out to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of his Subjects. Yet like a Noble
and Religious Prince, touch'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
when the Wars were ended, <hi>viz.
An. 1361, regni</hi> 35. he granted them all
(save those few that he had put away)
back again unto them by his Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
as freely as they had formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
them. And divers of those that
were purchas'd by his Subjects, were by
them new-founded and given back to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Uses. This act of the King's was
a precedent of singular Piety; yet was it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48454:83"/>
but a lame Offering, not an Holocaust.
He gave back the Possessions, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the Profits, which he had taken for
23 Years. <hi>Speed, p.</hi> 211.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>John</hi> (whom they so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn)
did more than this, if he had
done it as willingly. He restor'd the
Lands with the Damages. But let not
this good King want the charitable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
due unto his Piety; though
having dipt his Hands in this—We
be driven by the course of our Argument,
to observe what after befell to him and
his Off-spring. There be some things,
saith ... are sweet in the Mouth, but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Belly; pleasant at the beginning,
but woful in the end. If these Priories
and their Churches were of that nature,
the sequel verifies the Proverb. The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
part of the King's Life was most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
and victorious; yea, all the while
that these things were in his Hands, even
as if God had bless'd him, as he did <hi>Obed-Edom
(1 Sam. 6. 10.)</hi> whilst the Ark was
in his House; and had the King then dy'd,
he had been a most glorious pattern of
earthly Felicity. But the Wheel turn'd,
and his Oriental Fortunes became Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental.
The Peace he had concluded with
<hi>France</hi> for the solace of his Age, brake
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48454:83"/>
out again into an unfortunate War. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Subjects there rebell: <hi>Gascony</hi> in
effect is lost. Afflictions at home fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in sequence; his Son <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke
of <hi>Clarence</hi> dieth without Issue-male, and
when he had greatest need of his renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Son the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> (miracle of
Chivalry, and the Anchor of his Kingdom)
him even then did God take from him;
his Court and Nobles discontented and
in Faction; himself and all things much
misgovern'd by his Son the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi>
and others of that part; who by the
Parliament are therefore remov'd from
him, and by him recall'd notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to the grief of all the Kingdom. Thus
he dieth, leaving his unweildy Scepters
to the feeble Arms of a Child of Eleven
Years old, King <hi>Richard</hi> II. whose lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
History, for the honour of Kings is
best unspoken of. But so unfortunate he
was among his other Calamities, that he
was not only deposed by his unnatural
Subjects, but imprison'd and murther'd,
dying without Issue, and leaving an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
possessor of his Kingdoms; which
kindled such Fuel of Dissention, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
almost all the Royal Line and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

To return to the Restitution made by
King <hi>Edw.</hi> III. of the Priories-Alien. An
Historian termeth it, <hi>A rare Example of
a just King;</hi> it being seldom seen that
Princes let go any thing whereon they
have once fasten'd. But this King having
made a Door in this manner into the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and possession of the Church, all the
Power he had, either ordinarily or by
Prerogative, could not now so shut it up,
but that this Precedent would for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be a Key to open it at the pleasure of
Posterity; which was well seen not long
after. For in the Parliament, <hi>An.</hi> 9. of
King <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>The Knights and Burgesses
with some of the Nobility, being in a great
rage (as John Stow</hi> saith) <hi>against the
Clergy, for that</hi> William Courtney <hi>the
Archbishop would not suffer them to be
charged in Subsidy by the Laity; exhibited
a Petition to the King, that the Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
might be taken from them; saying,
That they were grown to such Pride, that
it was Charity and Alms to take them from
them, to compell them thereby to be more
meek and humble.</hi> And so near the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-men
thought themselves the point
of their desire, that one promised himself
thus much of this Monastery, another so
much of another Monastery. And I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48454:84"/>
heard (saith <hi>Tho. Walsingham</hi>) one of the
Knights deeply swear, that of the Abbey
of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> he would have a thousand
Marks by the Year of the Temporalities.
But the King, hearing the inordinate cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out on the one side, and the just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
on the other, deny'd his consent and
commanded the Bill to be cancell'd. <hi>Stow,

demanded their Hostage; and
for that they would not deliver him, they
were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> from
whence they escap'd and took Sanctuary
at <hi>Westminster.</hi> This highly offended the
Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> who thought that the
having the Earl's Son might be some help
to his Enterprize for the Kingdom of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile.</hi>
Whereupon Sir <hi>Ralph Ferreis</hi> and
Sir <hi>Alan Boxhull</hi> Constable of the <hi>Tower,</hi>
consulting with the Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> the

other arm'd men (about 50 in all) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, and the Parties
being then hearing of Mass, they laid
Hands upon <hi>Shakel,</hi> drew him forth of it,
and sent him to the <hi>Tower:</hi> But <hi>Hauley</hi>
standing upon his defence, they murther'd
him in the Quire before the Stall of the
Abbot, together with a Monk that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
them to forbear him in that place.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> with 5
of his Suffragans, openly pronounced Sir
<hi>Ralph Ferreis</hi> and Sir <hi>Alan Boxhull,</hi> and
all that were present with them at this
Murther, accursed, and all them likewise
that were aiding or counselling to it; the
King, the Queen, and the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi>

for long after was denounc'd
every <hi>Sunday, Wednesday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> in

And though the Duke was excepted in it,
yet did it trouble him very fore for his
Friends; it being commonly said, that
they had done what was done, by his
Commandment. He causeth therefore
the Bishop, to be requir'd by Letters from

spoiling also the Country about.
Upon the day they went to Ship, they
took a Bride as she came from Church,
and many Widows, Wives, and Maids out
of the Monastery, to do them Villainy on
Ship-board; and a Chalice off of the Altar
from the Priest, having ended his Mass.
Sir <hi>John Arundel</hi> having heard much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
regarded it not; but Sir <hi>Thomas
Piercy,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Calverley</hi> and others (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they departed) made Proclamation,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48454:86"/>
that those to whom their Soldiers had
done wrong, should come and have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence;
which they perform'd. The
People therefore pray'd for them and their
Company, but cursed bitterly Sir <hi>John A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel</hi>
and his Soldiers; which was much
aggravated by the Priest that lost the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice:
For he drawing other Priests unto him,
pursu'd them to the Sea-side; and there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of their Devotion curs'd
them with Bell, Book and Candle; and
throwing a light Taper into the Sea,
wish'd that they might be so extinguish'd.</p>
                  <p>Not many hours after, there arose a
storm, which the Master of Sir <hi>John</hi>'s
Ship (one <hi>Robert Rust</hi> of <hi>Blackeney</hi>) mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusted
by some sore tokens, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him to have staid till it were past;
but Sir <hi>John</hi> would not. This grew so
violent, as all presently despair'd of Life.
First, they threw out what they might to
lighten the Ship. When that serv'd not,
the Soldiers with the same Arms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
before they had amorously embrac'd
the Women, with the same now they ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannously
threw them over-board (60 in
number, as was reported) and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
in the Jaws of Death for divers days
together. Toss'd thus with fears, they
at last espy'd an Island on the Coast of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:48454:87"/>
Sir <hi>John</hi> being glad thereof, furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
compell'd the Mariners to make
for it; tho' they importunately (for fear
of Rocks) desir'd to have kept the Deep.
Thrusting therefore between it and the
Main, and finding nothing but horrible
Rocks, their fear was multiply'd, and
their ship now began to take Water also.
Yet at last they perceiv'd where with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
they might climb up into the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland;
and therefore running the ship on
Ground (that being broken they might
escape by the pieces of it) they got so
near the Island, that <hi>Robert Rust</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
leap'd to the sands, and many others
following him. Then Sir <hi>John Arundel</hi>
leap'd also; and being on the sands he
stood as out of danger, shaking the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
off him that he had taken in the ship,
when as the place being a Quick-sand,
began suddenly to swallow him up;
which the Master, <hi>Robert Rust,</hi> perceiving,
stepp'd to him, and striving to help him
out, a Billow coming upon them, wash'd
them both into the Sea, where thus they
ended their Lives, <hi>N. Musard</hi> a most
valiant Esquire of Sir <hi>John</hi>'s being also
leap'd on the sands and having hold of a
piece of the Ship, was wash'd back and
dash'd in pieces against the Rocks: so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48454:87"/>
was one <hi>Derrick</hi> another Esquire, Sir
<hi>Tho. Banaster,</hi> Sir <hi>N. Trompington,</hi> Sir
<hi>Thomas de Dale,</hi> being leap'd on the sands,
and hinder'd by striving to out-run one
another, the Billows fetch'd them also
back into the Deep. Some escaping to
the Island all wet, and finding no Houses
there, it being the 16th of <hi>December,</hi>
died for Cold. The rest with running
and wrastling sav'd their Lives, but in
great penury, from <hi>Thursday</hi> till <hi>Sunday</hi>
at Noon. Then the storm being ended,
the <hi>Irish</hi> by Boats fetch'd them to their
Houses and reliev'd them. It is said, That
Sir <hi>John Arundel</hi> lost in this storm (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his Life) 52 Suits of very rich Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
much princely stuff, with his great
Horse and other Horses and things of price,
to the value of Ten thousand Marks; and
twenty five other ships which followed
him with Men, Horses and other Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all perishing with him.</p>
                  <p>Touching the residue not guilty of this
Out-rage and Sacrilege, Sir <hi>Thomas Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
Sir <hi>Hugh Calverley,</hi> Sir <hi>William Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and the rest of the Army, they were
far and near dispers'd on the Seas with
the same dangers; but it pleased God to
preserve them. Yet as soon as the storm
was ended, a new Misfortune fell upon
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48454:88"/>
Sir <hi>Tho. Piercy;</hi> for being weak and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beaten
with all his Company, a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Man of War now setteth upon him
singled from the rest of the Navy, and
drives him to bestir himself as he could;
which he did so happily, as at last he
took the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and bringing him
home, brought also the occasion of double
Joy, one for his safety, the other for his
victory. And then pawning that ship for
100 <hi>l.</hi> he presently furnish'd himself forth
again, and with as great Joy arriv'd safely
at <hi>Brest</hi> (whereof he was one of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
with Sir <hi>Hugh Calverly</hi>) and thus
supply'd that charge also very fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Hugh Calverley</hi> also and Sir <hi>William
Elmham</hi> with the rest of those Ships, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
safely into other parts, and by the
great Mercy of God lost not either Man,
Horse, or any other thing, in all this so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a Tempest. All this is much largerly

            <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The Attempt and Project upon the Lands of
the Clergy in the Time of Henry IV. dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BY that Time King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was
come to the Crown the Clergy of
<hi>England</hi> had passed the Meridian of their
greatness, and were onward in their decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
For the People now left to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
them, as before they had done, and
by little and little to fall off from them
in every Place being most distracted,
though not wholly led away by the prime
Lectures, Sermons, and Pamphlets of them
that laboured for an alteration in Religion.
The Commons also of Parliament, which
usually do breath the Spirit of the People,
not only envied their greatness, but thought
it against reason, that those whom the
Laity had raised, fed and fatted by their
Alms and Liberality, should use such ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Jurisdiction (so they accounted it)
over their Patrons and Founders, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Religion also, that they who had
devoted themselves to Spiritual contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48454:89"/>
should be so much intangled with
the Secular affairs: But above all, that
they who laboured not in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
nor were the hundredth part of
the People, should possess as great a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
almost of the Kingdom, as the whole
Body of the Laity. For an Estimate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
had been taken anciently by the Knight's
Fees of the Kingdom, which in <hi>Edward</hi> I.
Time were found to be 67000, and that
28000 of them were in the Clergy's hands:
So that they had gotten well towards one
half of the Knight's Fees of the Kingdom,
and had not the Statutes of <hi>Mortmain</hi> come
in their way, they were like enough in a
short time to have had the better part.
Yet did not the Statutes otherwise hinder
them, but that with the King's Licence
they daily obtained great accessions, and
might by the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. be
thought probably enough to have half the
Kingdom amongst them, if not more, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that out of that part, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
to the Laity, they had after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a tenth part by way of Tithe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that an inestimable Revenue by way
of Altarage, Offerings, Oblations, Obven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Mortuaries, Church-Duties, Gifts,
Legacies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:48454:90"/>
The Parliament therefore 6 <hi>Henry</hi> IV.
(called the <hi>Laymen's Parliament</hi> that all
Lawyers were shut out of it) casting a
malevolent Eye hereon, did not seek by
a Moderate course a Reformation, but as
may be observed in other cases, to cure a
great excess by an extreme defect, and at
one blow, to take from the Clergy all
their Temporalities.</p>
            <p>This was propounded to the King by
Sir <hi>John Cheiney</hi> their Speaker, who in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time had been himself a Deacon, and
lapping then some of the Milk of the
Church found it so sweet, as he now
would eat of the Breasts that gave it. He
inforced this proposition with all the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
and Power he had, and tickled so
the Ears of the King, that if the Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had not that day stood, like
<hi>Moses,</hi> in the gap, the evils that succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
might even then have fallen upon the
Clergy. But the Archbishop declaring,
that the Commons sought thereby their
own enriching, knowing well that they
should be sharers in this Royal prey, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the King, that as he and his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
(<hi>Edward</hi> III. and <hi>Richard</hi> II.) had by
the Counsel of the Commons confiscated
the Goods and Lands of the Cells or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,
that the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:48454:90"/>
did possess in <hi>England,</hi> being worth
many thousands of Gold, and was not
that day the richer thereby half a Mark;
so if he should now (which God forbid)
fulfill their wicked desire, he should not
be one Farthing the richer the next Year
following. This demonstrative and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
Speech pronounced with great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency
by the Archbishop, it so wrought
upon the Heart of the King, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
he would leave the Church in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
State than he found it, rather than
in worse. And thus that Hideous Cloud of
Confusion, which hung over the Head of
the Clergy vapoured suddenly at this time
into nothing. Yet did it lay the Train
that <hi>Henry</hi> V. did make a sore Eruption,
and in <hi>Henry</hi> VIIIth's Time blew up at
the Monasteries. The event of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Speakers, his lineal Heir Sir <hi>Tho.
Cheiney,</hi> Lord Warden of the Cinque Port
did then behold, and shortly felt the
wrathfull Hand of God, upon his Family;
whether for this or any other Sin I dare
not judge.</p>
            <p>But being reputed to be the greatest
Man of Possessions in the whole Kingdom,
in so much as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> on a time
said merrily unto him, that they two
(meaning her self and him) were the two
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48454:91"/>
best Marriages in <hi>England,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appeared to be true in that his Heir
was said to sue his Livery at 3100, never
done by any other. Yet was this huge
Estate all wasted on a suddain.</p>
            <p>Yet when the Commons did desire to
have the Lands of the Clergy, they did
not design, or wish that they should be
otherwise employ'd, than for publick Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the whole Kingdom, and that all
Men should be freed thereby from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Subsidies or Taxes to maintain
Soldiers for the Defence of the Kingdom.
For they suggested, that the value of the
Lands would be sufficient Maintenance for
a standing Army, and all great Officers
and Commanders to conduct and manage
the same, for the safety of the Publick; as
that they would maintain 150 Lords,
1500 Knights, 6000 Esquires, and an
100 Hospitals for maimed Soldiers. Thus
they projected many good uses to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
not to enrich private Men, or to
sell them for small Summs of Money,
which would quickly be wasted; but to
be a perpetual standing Maintenance for
an Army and all publick Necessities.</p>

his Companions; that other was hanged

The Cardinal, that obtained the

licence, fell most grievously into the
King's displeasure, lost all he had, was fain
to be relieved by his Followers, and died
miserably, not without the suspicion of
poysoning himself. The Pope that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <p>And the Project was, if the Parliament

Friaries, Nunneries, and other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,
that for ever in time to come he
would take order, that the same should

                  </p>
                  <p>Now observe the Catastrophe. In the
same Parliament of 32. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. when
the great and opulent Priory of <hi>St. Johns
of Jerusalem</hi> was given to the King, he
demanded and had a Subsidy, both of
the Clergy and Laity; and the like he
had in 34. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and in 37. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
VIII. he had another Subsidy. And since
the dissolution of the said Monasteries, he
exacted divers Loans, and against Law
receiv'd the same.</p>
                  <p>Thus the great Judge, the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>
doth severely censure the ill-doings under
<hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and sheweth, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the infinite Wealth in Money,
Lands, and other Riches, which came to
the King by the dissolutions, yet the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were burthen'd with more Taxes, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies,
and Loans, than ever in former
Times. That it fully appeareth, that as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48454:94"/>
the goodly pretences to free the People
from Subsidies and several Payments, were
but empty and vain pretences, only <hi>ad
favendum populum,</hi> to deceive and abuse
the People.</p>
                  <p>So in our late long Parliament many
publick Projects and Pretences were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and the Presbyterian party were
zealous to advance the Throne of Christ,
and the Tribunal of Christ, with all his
holy Ordinances in full force, as their
Language did propose it. But it was
quickly discover'd that no such Matters
were truly intended, but only the Land
of the Church must be taken to maintain
Armies, to bring in the <hi>Scots-Highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Red-shanks, Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> to
subvert the King, his Crown and Dignity;
and in the end to take all the Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
and to divide them amongst the
Soldiers and others at their pleasures.</p>
                  <p>But the dismal Events and tragical Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
that have happen'd might have been
foreseen and prevented, but that most Men
are ignorant of our own Histories and
Chronicles, as well as of foreign Histories
and Examples, wherein they might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have observ'd the fearfull ends that have
follow'd upon the like doings, both in
our own Kingdoms and other neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48454:95"/>
Nations, as <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi>
especially within these last forty
Years. For as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>There is no
new thing under the Sun.</hi> For the like
hath happen'd often both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
but that Men will take no warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by any Examples, but persist in their
wicked and sacrilegious Attempts, tho'
in the end they bring confusion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
upon themselves.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is said, that when <hi>Henry</hi> V.
suppress'd the Priories Aliens, a good part
of their Lands was given to other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Houses, both by that King and his
Son <hi>Henry</hi> VI. who bestow'd a great part
of those Lands upon Colleges in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,
it is true; but in our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there is no such care taken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
any part of the Church-lands to pious
and publick Uses, but the Cormorants
devour all.</p>
                  <p>They spake also of maintaining many
Hospitals for relieving of maim'd Soldiers:
in our present time there is an infinite
Number of maim'd Soldiers, but no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals
provided for them; whereas they
should have provided some good Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
and withall an hundred <hi>Bedlams</hi> to
entertain pious, zealous, and outragious
<hi>Puritans,</hi> who have lost their Wits and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48454:95"/>
Senses, and are become extremely mad
with distemper'd Zeal, as the Anabaptists
and Fifth-Monarchy-men, Quakers, and

            <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Of the great Sacrilege and Spoil of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
committed by Henry VIII. His
promise to employ the Lands to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Learning, Religion, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the Poor. The preamble of the
Statute 27. Henry VIII. to that purpose
which is omitted in the printed Statutes.
The neglect of that Promise. The great
increase of Lands, and Wealth that came
to the King by the Dissolution, Quadruple
to the Crown-lands. The Accidents which
happen'd to the King and his Posterity:
to the Agents under him, as the Lord
Cromwell and others, to the Crown, and
the whole Kingdom, and to the new Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Lands. A View of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
that passed the Acts of the 27
and 31 of Henry VIII. and of the Lords
that voted in them, and what happened
to them and their Families. The Names
of the Lords in the 27 of Henry VIII.
omitted in the Record, but those of the
31 Henry VIII. are remaining being most
the same Men. The Names of the Lords
Spiritual in those Parliaments, and the<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48454:97"/>
great Spoil of Libraries and Books. The
Names of the Lords Temporal in those
Parliaments with the Misfortunes in their
Families, and Dignity abated. What hath
happened to the Crown it self by the loss
of Crown-lands. What hath happened to
the Kingdom in general, and the great
Injury done to the Poor. The Mischief of
the Tenure of Knights-service in Capite,
which by Act is to be reserved upon all
Church-lands that pass from the Crown.
The ancient Original of Wardship from the
Goths and Lombards, the abuse of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us. The prediction of Egebred an
old Hermite. The unfortunate Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Palsgrave and other Princes
of Germany, by invading the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Church. How carefull the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
were not to misuse the things conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
to their Gods. King James's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the University of Oxon about Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Am now come off the Rivers into the
Ocean of Iniquity and Sacrilege, where
whole thousands of Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
dedicated to the Service of God in the
same manner, that the rest are which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to us at this day, together with the
Monasteries and other Houses of Religion
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48454:97"/>
and intended Piety, were by King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
VIII. in a temper of indignation against
the Clergy of that time mingled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable
Avarice, sacked and rased as by
an Enemy. It is true the Parliament did
give them to him, but so unwillingly (as
I have heard) that when the Bill had
stuck long in the lower House, and could
get no passage, he commanded the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to attend him in the Forenoon in
his Gallery, where he let them wait till
late in the Afternoon, and then coming
out of his Chamber, walking a turn or
two amongst them, and looking angrily
on them, first on one side, then on the
other, at last, <hi>I hear</hi> (saith he) <hi>that my
Bill will not pass; but I will have it pass,
or I will have some of your Heads;</hi> and
without other Rhetorick or Perswasion
returned to his Chamber. Enough was
said, the Bill passed, and all was given
him as he desired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In the 27th Year of his Reign all
Monasteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not having 200 <hi>l. per
Annum</hi> in Revenue; then in <hi>Anno</hi> 31, all
the rest through the Kingdom; in <hi>An. 32.
cap.</hi> 24. the Hospitals and Hospital Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of St. <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with their Lands and Appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances:
and in <hi>Anno 37. cap.</hi> 4. all Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48454:98"/>
Free-Chapels, Chauntries, Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
Fraternities, and Stipendiary-Priests
made to have continuance for ever, being
contributary to the payment of First-fruits,
Tenths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what should have been
next (God knows) Bishopricks I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and Cathedral-Churches, which had
been long assailed in the time of <hi>R.</hi> II. <hi>H.</hi> IV.
and <hi>H.</hi> V. but the next Year was the time
of his account to Almighty God, which,
as it is said, he passed in great penitency
for his Sins. It is to be observed that the
Parliament did give all these to the King,
yet did they not ordain them to be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
or employed to any irreligious Uses,
leaving it more to the conscience and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the King, who in a Speech to the
Parliament promised to perform the Trust,
wherein he saith,—<q>I cannot a little
rejoyce, when I consider the perfect
truth and confidence, which you have
put in me, in my good doings and just
proceedings; for you without my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and request have committed to my
order and disposition, all Chauntries,
Colleges and Hospitals, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
specified in a certain Act, firmly
trusting that I will order them to the
Glory of God and the Profit of the
Common-wealth. Surely if I contrary
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48454:98"/>
to your expectation should suffer the
Ministers of the Churches to decay, or
Learning (which is so great a Jewel)
to be minished, or the poor and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to be unrelieved, you might well
say, that I being put in such a special
Trust, as I am in this Case, were no
trusty Friend to you, nor charitable to
my Emne-Christen, neither a lover of
the publick Wealth; nor yet one that
feared God, to whom account must be
rendred of all our doings; doubt not I
pray you, but your expectation shall
be served more godly and goodly, than
you will wish or desire, as hereafter you
shall plainly perceive.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that the King hereby doth not only
confess the Trust committed to him by
the Parliament in the same Manner, that
the Act assigns it, <hi>viz.</hi> to be for the Glory
of God, and the Profit of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
but he descendeth also into the
particulars of the Truth,<note place="margin">f. trust.</note> as namely for
the maintenance of the Ministers, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Learning, and Provision
for the Poor.</p>
            <p>So likewise in the Statute 27. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
VIII. <hi>c.</hi> 28. the Preamble doth expresly
ordain that the Lands, Houses, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
should be converted to better Uses,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48454:99"/>
as appears fully in the Preamble, which
because it is omitted in the printed Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Statutes shall here follow out
of the Record—For as much as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vid. <hi>Monast. Angl. T.</hi> 1. p.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding these fair Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Projects little was performed: for
Desolation presently followed this Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
the Ax and the Mattock ruined
almost all the Chief and most magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Ornaments of the Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> 376
of the lesser Monasteries, 645 of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort, 90 Colleges, 110 Religious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals,
2374 Chantries and Free-Chapels.
All these Religious Houses, Churches, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
and Hospitals being about 3500
little and great in the whole, did amount
to an inestimable Summ, especially if their
Rents be accounted as they are now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
in these days. Among this Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
it is needless to speak of the great
Church of St. <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Bulloign,</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the taking of that Town in <hi>Anno</hi> 1544,
he caused to be pulled down, and a Mount
to be raised in the place thereof for plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Ordinances to annoy a Siege.<note place="margin">Speed, p. 231. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 128.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I will not be so bold as to father that
which followed upon this that preceded,
but the Analogy of my Discourse, and the
Course of [this] History do lead me to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48454:99"/>
relate what happened after this, (1) to
the King himself, (2) to his Children and
Posterity, (3) to them that were Agents
in the business, (4) to the Crown it self,
(5) to the whole Kingdom generally, (6)
to private Owners of these Monasteries
particularly.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> Then touching the <hi>King</hi> himself.
The Revenue that came to him in ten
Years space was more, if I mistake it not,
than Quadruple that of the Crown-lands
besides a Magazine of Treasure raised out
of the Money, Place, Jewels, Ornaments,
and Implements of Churches, Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and Houses with their Goods, State,
and Cattle, First-fruits and Tenths, given
by the Parliament in the 26th of his Reign.
Together with a Subsidy, Tenth and Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
from the Laity at the same time.
To which I may add the incomparable
Wealth of Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> a little before
confiscated also to the King, and a large
Summ raised by Knight-hood in the 25th
of this Reign.</p>
            <p>A Man may justly wonder how such
an Ocean of Wealth should come to be
exhausted in so short a time of Peace: But
God's blessing as it seemeth was not upon
it; for within four Years after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
all this, and had ruined and sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48454:100"/>
376 of the Monasteries, and brought
their Substance to his Treasury; besides
all the goodly Revenues of his Crown,
he was drawn so dry, that the Parliament
in the 31st. was constrained by his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to supply his wants with the Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
of all the Monasteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
645 great ones, and illustrious with
all their Wealth and Prince-like Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Yet even then was not this King so
sufficiently furnished for building of a few
Block-houses for defence of the Coast, but
the next year after, he must have another
Subsidy of 4 Fifteens to bear out his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And (least it should be too little)
all the Houses, Lands and Goods of the
Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> both in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had not <hi>Ireland</hi> come thus in my way
I had forgotten it, but to increase the
Floods of this Sea, all the Monasteries of
<hi>Ireland</hi> likewise flowed into it by Act of
Parliament the next year following, being
the 33d. of his Reign to the Number one
and other of—</p>
            <p>But as the Red-sea by the miraculous
Hand of God was once dried up, so was
this Sea of Wealth by the wastfull Hand
of this Prince immediately so dried up,
as the very next year, <hi>viz. Regni</hi> 34. the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48454:100"/>
Parliament was drawn again to grant him
a great Subsidy, for in the Statute-book
it is so stiled: and this not serving his
turn, he was yet driven not only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance
his Gold and Silver-money in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
36,</hi> but against the Honour of a Prince
to coin base Money, and when all this
served not his turn in the very same year
to exact a Benevolence of his Subjects to
their grievous Discontent. Perceiving
therefore that nothing could fill the gulf
of his effusion, and that there was now a
just cause of great expence, by reason of
his Wars at <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> they
granted him in the 37th. Year 2 Subsidies
at once, and four Fifteens; and for a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary
all the Colleges, Free-Chapels,
Chantries, Hospitals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Number 2374. upon confidence
that he should dispose them (as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
solemnly in the Parliament) to the
Glory of God, who in truth (for ought
that I can hear) had little part thereof.</p>
            <p>The next year was his fatal Period, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
it was much to be feared that
Deans and Chapters, if not Bishopricks,
(which have been long levelled at) had
been his next design, for he took a very
good Say of them, by exchanging Lands
with them, before the Dissolution, giving
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48454:101"/>
them rackt Lands and small things for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Manners and Lordships, and also Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations
for their solid Patrimony in fina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Lands; like the exchange that <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
made with <hi>Glaucus,</hi> much thereby
encreasing his own Revenues; as he took
72 from <hi>York,</hi> besides other Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Advowsons, Patronages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the
37th of his Reign, which are mentioned
particularly in the Statute 37. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.
<hi>cap.</hi> 16. He took also 30 and above, as I
remember, in the 27th. Year from the
Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> whom he left not (that
I can learn) one Foot of the goodly Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
of his Church, save the Palace at
<hi>Norwich;</hi> and how many I know not, in
the 37th. Year also from the Bishop of
<hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I speak not of his prodigal Hand in the
Blood of his Subjects, which no doubt
much alienated the Hearts of them from
him. But God in these eleven Years space
visited him with 5 or 6 Rebellions. In
<hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> Anno 28, and 3 one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> Anno 33; one in <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setshire,</hi>
Anno 29, and again in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi>
Anno 33. And though Rebellions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections
are not to be defended, yet
they discover unto us what the displeasure
and dislike was of the common People
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48454:101"/>
for spoiling the Revenues of the Church;
whereby they were great losers, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
being mercifull Landlords, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Benefactors to all Men by their great
Hospitality and Works of Charity.</p>
            <p>Thus much touching his own Fortunes
accompanying the Wealth and Treasure
gotten by him, as we have declared by
confiscating the Monasteries; wherein the
prophetical Speech that the Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> used in the Parliament 6. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
IV. seemeth performed, <hi>That the King
should not be one farthing the richer the
next Year following.</hi>

               <head>II. What happened to the King's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Posterity.</head>
               <p>Touching his Children and Posterity,
after the time that he entered into these
Courses, he had two Sons and three
Daughters, whereof one of each kind died
Infants: the other three succeeding in the
Crown without Posterity. His base Son
the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> died also without
Issue; and as the Issue of <hi>Nebuchodonosor</hi>
was extinct, and his Kingdom given to
another Nation the 68th. Year after he
had rifled the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
taken away the holy Vessels; so about the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48454:102"/>
same period, that King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. began
to sack the Monasteries, with their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and things dedicated to God, was
his whole Issue extinct, Male and Female,
base and legitimate, and his Kingdom
transferred to another Nation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to another Royal Family (which is
now His Majesty's singular happiness)
that had no hand in the like depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that Kingdom, there committed by the
tumultuous, if not rebellious Subjects.
Contrary as it seems to the good liking
of our late Sovereign King <hi>James,</hi> who
(as is reported) said, that if he had found
the Monasteries standing he would not
have pulled them down; not meaning to
continue them in their superstitious Uses,
but to employ them, as <hi>Chorah's</hi> censers
to some godly purposes. Wherein most
piously he declared himself both in resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
(as I hear) some Bishopricks and
divers Appropriations in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by moving the Universities of <hi>England</hi>
to do the like, as by his gracious Letter
doth appear, which shall here following
be expressed in the end. So his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
King <hi>James</hi> the 4th. of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
when he was solicited by Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler,</hi>
then Embassador from King <hi>Henry;</hi> to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48454:102"/>
augment his Estate by taking into his
Hands the Abbies; <hi>James</hi> refus'd, saying,
What need I take them into mine Hands,
when I may have any thing I require of
them? And if there be Abuses in them I
will reform them, for there be a great
many good. Which was a wise answer,
and if King <hi>Henry</hi> had done the like here,
he might have had an immense and ample
Revenue out of the Monasteries and old
Bishopricks, while they enjoyed their
Lands (being a third part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as appears by <hi>Doomsday-Book</hi>) by
way of First-fruits, Tenths, Pensions, and
Corrodies yearly; that he should never
have needed at any time to ask one Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of his Subjects. To return where we
left off, having spoken of the extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Issue of King <hi>Henry,</hi> whereof
the immortally renown'd Princess Queen

himself as little Land in <hi>England,</hi> as his

Having sailed thus far in this Ocean,
we will advance yet further (if it please
God to give us a favourable passage) and
take a view of the Parliament themselves,
that put the wrackful Sword in the King's
Hands. The chief whereof was (as we
have said before) that of the 27 Year of
his Reign, touching smaller Houses, and
that of 31 touching the greater. I have
sought the Office of the Clerk of the
Upper House of Parliament to see what
Lords were present at the passing of the
Acts of Dissolution; but so ill have they
been kept, as that the Names of 27 [<hi>H.</hi> 8.]
were not then to be found: and farther
since I have not search'd for them. The
other of 31 [<hi>H.</hi> 8.] I did find, and doubt
not but the most of them were the same,
which also sate in the Parliament of 27,
tho' some of them of 27 were either dead
or not present in 31. Those that were
present at the passing of the Bill of 31 I
have here under mention'd in such order
as I therein did find them; and will as
faithfully as I can attain unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <p>Concerning the Bishops it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
how they gave their Voices; but it

yet it is not so recorded upon this,
but although many might dissent, and
that publickly, yet there was a major

carried it by Voices. It is testify'd of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Latimer,</hi> that he much desir'd that
two or three Abbies of the greater sort
might be preserv'd in every Shire for pious
and charitable Uses: Which was a wise
and godly motion, and perhaps the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that the King did convert some (in
part) to good purposes: Yet the Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was so universal that <hi>Jo. Bale</hi> doth
much lament the loss and spoil of Books
and Libraries in his Epistle upon <hi>Leland</hi>'s
Journal <hi>Leland</hi> being imploy'd by the
King to survey and preserve the choicest
Books in their Libraries.) If there had
been in every Shire of <hi>England</hi> (saith <hi>Bale</hi>)
but one solemn Library to the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those Noble Works, and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of good Learning in our Posterity,
it had been yet somewhat, but to destroy
all without consideration, it is and will
be unto <hi>England</hi> for ever a most horrible
Infamy amongst the grave Seniors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations. Adding further, that they
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48454:107"/>
who got and purchased the Religious
Houses at the Dissolution of them, took
the Libraries as part of the Bargain and
Booty—<hi>reserving of those Library
Books, some to serve their Jakes, some to
scour their Candlesticks, and some to rub
their Boots, some they sold to the Grocers
and Soap-sellers, and some they sent over
Sea to the Book-binders; not in small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
but at times whole Ship-fulls to the
wondering of foreign Nations.</hi> And after
he also addeth, <hi>I know a Merchant-man,
which all this time shall be nameless, that
bought the Contents of two noble Libraries
for</hi> 40s. <hi>a piece, a shame it is to be spoken:
this stuff hath he occasioned instead of Grey
Paper by the space of more than these ten
Years, and yet he hath enough for many
Years to come: a prodigious Example is this
and to be abhorred of all men who love
their Nation as they should do.</hi> And well
he might exclaim, a prodigious Example,
it being a most wicked and detestable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to Religion and Learning: Yet thus
are Men often transported with Passion in
the heat of Reformation, and fiery Zeal
without Wisdom.</p>

one of the Peers of the Upper-House at

This honourable Family seems more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate

than any of the precedent, for their
lineal descent remains entire and without

               <p>Now I labour in observing the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
seeing the whole body of the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
is since that fallen so much from their
ancient lustre, magnitude and estimation.
I that about 50 Years agoe did behold
with what great respect, observance and
distance, principal Men of Countries ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
themselves to some of the meanest
Barons, and so with what familiarity infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Gentlemen often do accost many of
these of our times, cannot but wonder
either at the Declination of the one, or at
the Arrogance of the other; but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what an eminent Divine once
said in a Sermon; he compared Honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Dignities to Gold, the heaviest and
most precious Metal, but Gold (saith he)
may be beaten so thin, as the very Breath
will blow it away; so Honour may be
dispers'd so popularly, that the Reputation
of it will be pretermitted.</p>
               <p>To say what I observe herein, as the
Nobility spoiled God of his Honour by
putting those things from him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
them to lazy and vulgar Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
so God to requite them hath taken
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48454:118"/>
the ancient Honours of Nobility, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
them to the meanest of the
People, to Shop-keepers, Taverners, Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
Tradesmen, Burghers, Brewers, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers;
and it may be supposed, that as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine
the Great</hi> seeing the inconvenience
of the multitude of <hi>Comites</hi> of his time
distinguished them,<note place="margin">De Vitâ Const. l. 4. c. 1.</note> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> reporteth,
into three degrees making the latter far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to the former; so may it one day
come to pass among these of our times;
and it shall not want some precedent of
our own to the like purpose. <hi>Vide, Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarium

               <head>IV. What hath happened to the Crown
it self.</head>
               <p>It now remaineth to shew how the
Lands themselves thus pulled from the
Church, have thriven with the Crown,
and in the Hands of the King his Heirs
and Successors; truly no otherwise than
the Archbishop I spake of so long since
foretold. For they have melted and dropt
away from the Crown like Snow; yet
herein that Snow leaves moisture, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
the Ground, but those nothing save
dry and fruitless Coffers; for now they
are all gone in a manner, and little to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48454:119"/>
speak of remaining for them to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury;
for my own part, I think the Crown
the happier that they are gone, but very
unhappy in their manner of going, for as
<hi>Sampson</hi> going out of <hi>Gaza</hi> carried with
him the Gates,<note place="margin">Judg. 16.</note> the Bars and Posts of the
City, leaving it thereby exposed to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
weak and undefenced, so those
Lands going from the Crown, have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with them the very Crown-Lands
themselves, which were in former
times, the glorious Gates of Regal Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,
the present and ready Bars of
Security at all Necessities, and like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
Posts, or <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars in all
the transmigrations of Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
had to our Time (1000 Years and
upward) remained fixed and amor ...
to the Scepter. These, I say, are in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
all gone, since the Dissolution: the
new Piece hath rent away the old Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Title of <hi>terra Regis,</hi> within
<hi>Dooms-day Book,</hi> was generally the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gett
in every County, is now a Blank, I
fear, in most of them.</p>
               <p>But his Majesty hath a great Fee-farm
reserved out of the greatest part of both
of them, 40000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, they say, out
of the Crown Lands, and 60000 <hi>l.</hi> out of
the Church Lands: I confess it makes a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48454:119"/>
goodly sound, yet is it but froth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the solid Land, which is deemed
to be more than ten times, if not twenty
times as much, and this being but <hi>succus
redditus,</hi> a sick and languishing Rent,
will grow daily as our Rents of Assess
have already done, to be of lesser worth,
as the price of Lands and Commodities
increase and rise higher; but I hear there
is ... thousand pounds a Year of the
Crown-lands gone, without any Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all, and above ... thousand
likewise of the Church Lands; and to tell
the truth, which my self do well know,
a great proportion of the Fee-farm Rents

generally.</head>
               <p>What the whole Body of the Kingdom
hath suffered since these Acts of Confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Monasteries and their Churches
is very remarkable; let the Monks and
Friers shift as they deserv'd, the good if
you will, and the bad together, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is not to defend their Iniquities; the
thing I lament is, that the Wheat pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48454:120"/>
with the Darnel, things of good
and pious Institution, with those that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
and perverted them; by reason
whereof the Service of God was not only
grievously wounded, and bleedeth at this
day, but infinite Works of Charity (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Poor were universally reliev'd thro'
the Kingdon) were utterly cut off and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd;
many thousand masterless Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
turn'd loose into the World, and
many thousand of poor People which were
constantly fed, clad and nourished by the
Monasteries, now like young Ravens seek
their Meat at God. Every Monastery ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Ability had an Ambery
(greater or little) for the daily relief of
the Poor about them. Every principal
Monastery an Hospital commonly for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
and an Infirmary, which we now
call a Spittle, for the sick and diseased
Persons, with Officers and Attendants to
take care of them. Gentlmen and others
having Children without means of Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
had them here brought up and
provided for, which course in some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and namely in <hi>Pomerland,</hi> (as I
hear) is still observed, tho' Monks and
Friers be abandoned. These and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Miseries falling upon the meaner sort
of People, drove them into so many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48454:120"/>
as we spake of, and rung such
loud peals in the King's Ears, that on his

               <head>VI. What happened to private Owners
of the Monasteries particularly.</head>
               <p>I turn now to the richer sort, and shall
not need to speak of the Clergy, whose
irreparable Misery <hi>Piers Ploughman</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
so many Ages before, saying, That
a King should come that should give the
Abbat of <hi>Abingdon</hi> such a blow, as incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
should be the Wound thereof. Their
Misery and Wrack is so notorious, as it
needs no Pen to decypher it; nor will I
speak of the loss that the Lay-men our
Grandfathers had by this means in their
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48454:121"/>
right of Founders and Patronage, Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenures,
Rents-services, Pensions, Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and many other Duties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
whereof some were saved by the
Statutes, yet by little and little all in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
worn out and gone. Those, I say, I
speak not of, for that they are Wounds
grown up and forgotten; but of one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of all, that immortal and incurable
Wound, which every day bleedeth more
than other, given to us and our Posterity
by the infinite number of Tenures by
Knights service <hi>in capite,</hi> either newly
created upon granting out of these Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
and Lands, or daily raised by double
<hi>Ignoramus,</hi> in every Town almost of the
Kingdom. For as the Abbies had Lands
commonly scattered abroad, in every of
them, in some greater or lesser quantity,
according to the Ability of their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
so the Leprosie of this Tenure
comes thereby as generally to be scatter'd
thro' the Kingdom. And whereas before
that time, very few did hold on that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
besides the Nobility and principal
Gentlemen that were owners of great
Lordships and Possessions, which from
time to time descended intirely to their
Heirs, and were not broken out into small
parcels amongst inferiour Tenents and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48454:121"/>
mean Purchasers. Now by reason that
those Abby Lands are minced into such
infinite numbers of little Quillets, and
thereby privily sown (like the Tares in
the Parable) almost in every Man's Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
very few (not having their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
certain from the King by Patent)
can assure themselves to be free from this
Calamity. The truth is, that originally
none held <hi>in Capite,</hi> but Peers of the
Realm, who were therefore called the
King's Barons, and such as by this their
Tenure (as appears by the Council of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon
10 Hen.</hi> 2.) had the privilege to
sit in the King's House, and to hear and
judge all Causes brought before the King,
and to be of his great Council. And tho'
afterwards the meaner of them were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
yet King <hi>John</hi> was tied by his great
Charter to call them all to Parliament,
where the Knights of the Shires in that
respect have their place at this day.</p>
               <p>I am too prone (you see) to run out of
my way into this Discourse, but to hold
me nearer to my Center, I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
what mov'd the Parliament in 27
<hi>Henry 8. cap.</hi> 27. to enact, that a Tenure
<hi>in Capite</hi> by Knights Service should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to the King, upon their granting
out of their Abbies and their Lands, as tho'
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48454:122"/>
it were some singular benefit to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth:
It may be they conceiv'd,
that according to the Project of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at <hi>Leicester</hi> in 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. that the
King should thereby have a perpetual
means to support a standing Army, or to
have it ready whensoever need required,
and so ease the Subject of all Military Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution.

of Wisdom deceived! or what hath that
Art of theirs produc'd other than as if some
Scholars had bound their Masters for to
whip them soundly; and I suppose they
have had their fill of it long e're this time.</p>
               <p>But these Tenures by being by this
means multiply'd in such excessive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the Kings former Officers, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could span their Business with their
Hand, could not now fathom this with
both their Arms. The greater Harvest
must have greater Barns and more La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers,
and therefore in 32 <hi>Hen. 8. cap.
46.</hi> and 33 <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 22. and 39. the
Court now called of Wards and Liveries,
with the Orders, Officers and Ministers
thereto belonging, was erected. What is
thereby fallen upon the Subject, I need
not relate; heavy Experience makes it
generally known, and generally felt; one
while by Wardship and Marriage, another
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48454:122"/>
while by suing out Livery and <hi>Ouster se
main,</hi> by Pardons of Alienation, Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Intrusions, respite of Homage, and
other Calamities accompanying this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
almost innumerable, consuming the
Fruit of the Wards Lands for many Years,
and (as sometimes I have seen) for many
Ages the Grandfathers, Fathers and Sons
Inheritance militant together in this
Court; the Mother equally lamenting the
Death of her Husband, and the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of her Child, the Confiscation of his
Lands for the 3d part of his Age, and
the Ransom of his Person before he can
enter into the World; the Family often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so ruin'd and impoverish'd, as if at
last it recover, yet it stands tottering and
lame for a long time after. Marriage
is honourable and instituted by God in
<hi>Paradise;</hi> do you think that a Man by
the Word of God may be compelled to
pay for a Licence to marry? I doubt the
Schoolmen would not so determine it;
nor did any civil or moral Nation of old
admit it; the Custom rose from the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gobards,</hi> and yet I
confess not without reason, as the Genius
of their Nation did then lead them, and
by their Example, all others where they
conquered. It was an impious manner of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48454:123"/>
those times to hold Malice and Enmity, one
Family against another, and against their
Friends and Alliances from one Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to another; our Ancestors called it
<hi>deadly feude,</hi> the Feudists, <hi>feudam;</hi> and
<hi>Tacitus</hi> in his time noteth it of <hi>Germans,</hi>
saying, <hi>Inimicitias mutuo ponunt &amp; susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt.</hi>
It was therefore of urgent neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
that the Lord should be well assur'd
that his Tenant married not unto any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
that might be either in feud with
him, or in alliance with them that were:
and to prevent that danger (as appears
by the Charter of <hi>Hen. 1. cap.</hi> 4.) the
Lord would have him bound not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
without his consent, for which in the
beginning the Tenant gave his Lord some
small matter, as <hi>munus honorarium;</hi> but
from thence it grew afterwards to <hi>Nundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria
gratissima.</hi> And as Bondmen used
to pay to their Lords Chiefage for their
Marriage, so the Tenants by Knights Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which in the Feudal Law is called
<hi>Feudum nobile,</hi> is likewise subject to this
brand of Servitude, and more grievously
in some respect. But I reverence the Law
I live under and hath been so long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
and practis'd, all I aim at, is only
to shew in the course of my Argument,
the Evils that have either fallen newly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48454:123"/>
us, or been encreased since the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scation
of the Churches and Church-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
which if it be not offensive, I
may say, doth seem to be foretold 800
Years since by one <hi>Egelzedus</hi> an Hermit,
who assigned three Causes of those Evils,
<hi>viz. First,</hi> Effusion of Blood. <hi>2ly,</hi> Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
and <hi>3ly,</hi> Contempt of the House
of God, telling us farther, That we should
know the time of the fulfilling this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
by the various fashions and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability
of Apparel that should be in use,
the very ear-mark of the Age we live
in.</p>
               <p>How this Contempt of the House of
God worketh upon the Sacrilegious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
thereof, is to be seen in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
before recited, to which if I should
run higher into former Ages, or further
from home in other Countries, I might
tire you with thousands of Examples.
But for a Conclusion mark this by the
way, that as <hi>England</hi> hath not been faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
alone in this kind of Transgression, so
other Nations offending in like manner,
have likewise tasted of the same Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or others like them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> after the rasing of their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
hath had the Royal Throne removed
from them and placed in another Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:48454:124"/>
The <hi>Low-Countries</hi> harrassed with a
continued War of 60 Years and more.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Palsgrave</hi> beaten out of his own
Dominions, and living now with his Royal
Wife and Children in lamentable Exile,
to which may be added (as concurring
with the usual Infelicity of meddling with
Church Lands) that the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> having
attained the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ecclesiastical Livings there for
maintenance of his Wars (as the Report
goes) he was presently cast out both of
that Kingdom, and of his other Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned this unfortunate
Prince, I must add also another accident
that befell him in this kind. The State
of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> while he lived in
Exile among them, gave unto him as a
place of Recreation the Abby of <hi>Regutian</hi>
near <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> where intending a sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Building, he drew out thereof such
Materials of Stone and Timber, as might
be usefull to his new Designs, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Store-house of the Abby-Church,
laid them up there to be in readiness. It
chanc'd that the truly noble Lord <hi>Craven</hi>
returning out of <hi>Italy</hi> (where my Son
was very happily fallen into his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)<note place="margin">i e. <hi>Sir</hi> John Spelman.</note>
he went to this place to visit the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48454:124"/>
Prince, whom they called the King of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia.</hi>
My Son seeing what the King
was about, and how he had prophaned
the Church by making it a Store-house,
said to my Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> That he fear'd it
might be ominous to the King; my Lord
answer'd, I will tell him what you say;
and turning to the King said, This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
fears this that your Majesty doth
will not be prosperous to you; the King
answered, That was but a Conceit, and so
pass'd it over. But mark what follow'd
upon it. The King within a few Months
after passing in a Bark with the Prince his
eldest Son over the <hi>Delf</hi> of <hi>Harlam,</hi> his
Boat was casually stemm'd and overturn'd
by a Barge that met him in the Night,
and tho' he himself with great difficulty
was sav'd, yet that hopefull Prince his Son
had not that wofull happiness to be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
right-out, but after he was drench'd in
the Water, and gotten upon the Mast of
the Bark wherein they perish'd, he was
there most miserably starv'd with Cold
and frozen to Death. And the Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
while he lamented the death of his Son,
was by an unusual death of Princes taken
away by the Plague, laying thus the first
Stone of his unfortunate Building, like
that of the Walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> in the death
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48454:125"/>
of his eldest Son, and prevented in the rest
by his own death. God's Judgments are
his Secrets; I only tell Concurrences.</p>
               <p>The other <hi>German</hi> Princes persecuted
with the Sword, and spoil'd of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>

that no one thing is a greater impediment
than want of competent living to maintain
Learned Men in such places of our Kingdom
where the ordinary Benefit of the Vicarages

found that there could not be a readier way

that to give beginning to so good a work,
none were more fit than the Colleges in the

of Our State, and having divers of them
many such Impropriations, and some of them
also a desire, as We are inform'd, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

their Example should have great effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

            <argument>
               <p>The particulars of divers Monasteries in
Norfolk, whereof the late Owners since
the Dissolution are extinct, or decayed, or
overthrown by Misfortunes and grievous
Accidents.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ABout the Year, I suppose, 1615 or
1616, I described with a Pair of
Compasses in the Mapp of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of 12 Miles, the Semi-diameter accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Scale thereof, placing the
Center about 24 the chief Seat of the <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertons</hi>
within this Circle and the Borders
of it; I inclosed the Mansion-houses of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
24 Families of Gentlemen, and the
sight of as many Monasteries all standing
together at the time of Dissolution; and I
then noted that the Gentlemen's Seats con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
at that day in their own Families
and Names. But the Monasteries had
flung out their Owners with their Names
and Families (all of them save 2) thrice
at least, and some of them 4 or 5 or 6
times, not only by fail of Issue, or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Sale, but very often by grievous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48454:128"/>
and Misfortunes. I observe yet
further, that though the Seats of these
Monasteries were in the fattest and choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
Places of all that Part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
(for our Ancestors offer'd like <hi>Abel,</hi>
the best unto God) yet it hath not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that any of them to my knowledge,
or any other in all this Country, hath
been the permanent Habitation of any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of Note, but like desolate Places left
to Farmers and Husbandmen, no Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
adventuring to build or dwell upon
them for dread of Infelicity that pursueth
them. Let me here report, what hath
been related to me from the Mouth of Sir
<hi>Clement Edmonds,</hi> lately a Clark of his
Majesty's Counsel, that did take his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
from the Council-books, <hi>viz.</hi> that
in the beginning of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign
the Parliament was not willing to restore
Popery and the Supremacy to the Pope,
unless they might be suffered to retain the
Lands, which were lately taken from the
Monasteries; this Resolution was signifi'd
to <hi>Rome,</hi> whereto the Pope gave Answer,
that for the Lands belonging to Religious
Houses he would dispense for detaining of
them, but for the Situation of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Churches, and such consecrated Ground,
there could be no alienation thereof to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48454:128"/>
profane Uses, whereupon those that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
them did not inhabit, or build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Houses, but forsook them for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years, till the time of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> a
great Plague happening, the poor People
betook themselves into the remainder of
the Houses, and finding many good Rooms,
began to settle there, till at length they
were put out by them, to whom the
grant of the Leases and Lands were made.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>'s Treat. 27 <hi>Feb.</hi> 1625</note>
We see hereby how fearfull they were
long after the Dissolution to meddle with
Places consecrated to God (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to superstitious Uses) when as yet
they had no experience what the Success
would be; let them therefore that shall
read this our Collection following, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it as they shall see Cause. I urge
nothing, as not medling with the secret
Judgments of Almighty God, but relate
<hi>rem gestam</hi> only as I have privately gotten
notice of it, and observed living in these
parts almost all my life, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faithfully to understand the truth, yet
no doubt many things have been mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by those who related them unto me;
and therefore I desire that wheresoever it
so falleth out, my Credit may not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged

by <hi>John Eyer,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> one of the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
or Receivers, a great Receiver of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48454:130"/>
Monasteries, and amongst others of that
of St. <hi>Edmondsbury;</hi> he married <hi>Margaret</hi>
Daughter of Sir <hi>Tho. Blendhasseil,</hi> Widow
of Sir <hi>John Spelman,</hi> eldest Son of Sir <hi>John
Spelman,</hi> and died without Issue.</p>
            <p>He in his life-time conveyed the four
first Monasteries to a Priest, from whom
the Corporation of <hi>Linn</hi> purchased the
<hi>Carmelites</hi> and <hi>Minorites;</hi> and being thus
enter'd into things consecrated to God,
purchased also the Impropriation of the
Church of St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s there, and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Church of St. <hi>James</hi> perverted it
to be a Town-house for the Manufacture
of Stuffs, Laces and Tradesmen's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
whereby they thought greatly
to enrich their Corporation and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Great Projects and good Stocks
with a Contribution from some Country-Gentlemen
were raised for this purpose,
two several times of my knowledge, but
the Success was, that it came to nought,
and all the Money employ'd about new
building and transforming the Church hath
only encreased Desolation: for so it hath
stood during the whole time almost of my
Memory, till they lately attempted by the
undertaking of Mr. <hi>Fr. Gurney,</hi> and some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisans
from <hi>London</hi> to revive the Enterprize
of their Predecessors; but speeding no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48454:130"/>
than they did, have now again with
loss of their Money and Expectation left it
to future Ruine, thus in this particular
hath been the Success of their Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For other matters I will only note
what I have observ'd touching them in the
general, when I was young, they flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
extraordinarily with Shipping-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
plenty of Merchandize native and
foreign, some Men of very great Worth,
as <hi>Killingtree, Grave, Clayburne, Vilet,
Lendall,</hi> many of good Note, as <hi>Grant,
Overend, Hoe, Baker, Waters,</hi> and many
more of later time; but all of them with
their Male-Posterity are in effect extinct
and gone, and as at this day they have
little shipping, or trade otherwise than to
the black <hi>Indies,</hi> as they call it, (that is
<hi>Newcastle</hi> for Coal) so there is not a Man
amongst them of any Estimation for his
Wealth, or of any Note (that I can hear
of) descended from any that was an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
there in the beginning of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

without Issue, and by his Will gave it to

died without Issue, whereupon the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
Friars was to revert to his Heir, but
having none, because he was a Bastard
great Suit ensued about it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>John Ditefield</hi> being then in Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, left it by Descent (as it seemeth)
to his Son <hi>John Ditefield,</hi> who gave it in
Marriage with <hi>Thomasin</hi> his sister to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher

Keeper, and he then recovered it in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery

out of his City of <hi>Rome,</hi> it cruelly sack'd,
and himself besieg'd in the Castle of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi>
taken Prisoner, scorned, and put to
Ransom: And after all this, was at last (as
some affirm) poison'd with certain of his
Cardinals and Friends, by the Fume of a
Torch prepared for that purpose. <hi>Stow</hi> in

Besides all these, Mr. <hi>Tho. Cromwell,</hi>
who then was but Servant to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
having a principal hand in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of these Monasteries given to
his Master, had also a principal share in
this Tragedy, for tho' he were after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
to great Honours, yet in the end
he was thrown out of them all, convicted
of Treason, attainted and beheaded, as in
other places heretofore we have more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related.</p>
               <p>Now we come nearer to, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to this Abbey, wherein, as also in
others of that Nature in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
and Bodies Politick that are the
Seminaries of the Church, little attention
is to be expected, yet see what happened
to their Tenants and Farmers, profanely
abusing the consecrate places thereof.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal did grant it to his Coll.
at <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and to whom
they first leased it I do not yet find, but
Mr. <hi>Tho. Hogan</hi> of <hi>Bradenham</hi> that was
Sheriff of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Eliz.</hi> died in his Sheriffship, and not long
after him his Son Mr. <hi>Hen. Hogan,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Son and Heir very young, who
attaining near to his full Age, and falling
sick, acknowledged a fine upon his Death-Bed
to the use of his Mother the Lady
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48454:139"/>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> that now is, and his half Sisters,

that means cut off his Heirs at common
Law, and was the last of his Father's

great Suits in the Star-Chamber, Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

               <p>The Lease is since come to Mr. <hi>Hamon.</hi>

               <p>Traveling through <hi>Cambridgeshire,</hi> and
passing through a Town there called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary,</hi>
I saw certain ruinous Walls, which
seemed to have been some Monastery,
hereupon I asked one of the Town, if it
had not been an Abbey? he answered me,
yes; I demanded of him whose it was, he
said one Mr. <hi>Foulkes;</hi> I asked him further,
how long he had had it? he said his Father
a <hi>Londoner</hi> bought it; then I desired to
know of him what Children he had? the

some by Misfortune. I having a jealous

both which died, one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>
                  <q>It is reported in our Histories, and I
have spoken of it before in the proper
place, that King <hi>Edgar</hi> leading his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
into the parts of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
a Rebellion of the <hi>Welshmen,</hi>
some of his Soldiers, among other spoil,
took away the Bell of St. <hi>Ellutus,</hi> and
hanged it about an Horse's Neck. And
it is noted upon this, that King <hi>Edgar</hi>
sleeping in the Afternoon, saw one in a
Vision that smote him on the Breast
with a Spear, and that thereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
both the Bell and the other spoil;
yet died within nine days folowing.</q>
(<hi>Holl.</hi> p. 161.) If the Vision be fabulous,
I maintain it not: tho' we have a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for it in the Ecclesiastical Histories,
about the Death of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate.
But the Mythology may be, that <hi>Edgar</hi>
(abounding with Devotion) was stricken
in Conscience with the Spear of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for this Sacrilege; and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his Restitution, his Life was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from him very shortly after.</p>
               <p>I shall make a great Leap from thence
to these latter Ages; but I can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than where Authors and my reading
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48454:148"/>
carry me. Only for our Fathers times, I
shall report what I have faithfully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Tradition.</p>
               <p>When I was a Child (I speak of about
threescore Years since) I heard much
talk of the pulling down of Bells in every
part of my Country the County of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
then common in Memory. And the
summ of the Speech usually was, that in
sending them over Sea, some were drown'd
in one Haven, some in another, as at <hi>Lyn,
Wells</hi> or <hi>Yarmouth.</hi> I dare not venture
upon Particularities; for that I then hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it as a Child, regarded it as a Child.
But the truth of it was lately discover'd by
God himself; for that in the Year ...
he sending such a <hi>dead Neipe</hi> (as they
call it) as no Man living was known to
have seen the like, the Sea fell so far back
from the Land at <hi>Hunstanton,</hi> that the
people going much further to gather Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
than they had done at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they there found a <hi>Bell</hi> with the Mouth
upward, sunk into the ground to the very
Brim. They carried the News thereof to
Sir <hi>Hamon le Strange,</hi> Lord of the Town,
and of Wreck, and Sea-rights there, who
shortly after sought to have weighed up
and gained the Bell; but the Sea never
since going so far back, they hitherto could
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48454:149"/>
not find the place again. This Relation I
receiv'd from Sir <hi>Hamon le Strange</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
being my Brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Such other Reports I have often in
times past heard, touching some other
parts of that Kingdom; but (as I said) I
then regarded them not, and will not
therefore now speak any thing of them.</p>
               <p>But dining one day at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> with
the most Reverend Father in God, <hi>George</hi>
the late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> it
pleased his Grace, in way of Discourse, to
tell me, That being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his first entrance in <hi>Dunber,</hi> he
viewed the Church there, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there was never a Bell in the
Steeple, demanded the reason of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.
Who not pleas'd with the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
answer'd somewhat scornfully, That
it was one of the Reformed Churches;
implying thereby, that the Reformed
Churches had no Bells. Then going
to <hi>Edinborough,</hi> he found no Bell in all
the City, save one only in the Church
of St. <hi>Andrew;</hi> and enquiring there also
of the reason, it was told him, <q>That
the rest were pull'd down and shipp'd to
be carried into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> but
were all drowned in <hi>Leigh Haven.</hi>
                  </q>
Such havock in pulling down Bells and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48454:149"/>
defacing otherwise of Churches, had no
doubt proceeded furiously throughout all
<hi>England,</hi> if Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in <hi>An.</hi> 2. of
her Reign, had not by her Proclamations
and course of the Star-Chamber, very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
prevented the same.</p>
               <p>At the end of Qu. <hi>Mary</hi>'s days (<hi>Callis</hi>
being taken) Sir <hi>Hugh Paulett</hi> pull'd down
the Bells of the Churches of <hi>Jersey,</hi> and
sending them to St. <hi>Malo's</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi>
fourteen of them were drowned at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of that Harbour. Whereupon, it is
a by-word at this day in these parts, when
any strong East-wind bloweth there, to
say, <hi>The Bells of</hi> Jersey <hi>now ring. (Ex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione

               </p>
               <p>More to this purpose may appear in the
Discourse next following; which lying
now at my hand, I thought good to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
not only for coherence of the matter,
but also to shew the Opinion, Piety, and
Tenderness herein, of the greatest Father
and Magistrate of our Church (under the
King) at that time living.</p>
               <p>Dining yesterday at <hi>Lambeth</hi> with my
Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nov. 13. 1632.</note> his Grace falling ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
into a Discourse of <hi>Spanish</hi> matters,
and the Wealth of their Churches, said,
That he had heard that the very Lamps of
<hi>Spain</hi> were worth half the Treasure of that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48454:150"/>
Kingdom. And calling to him Mr...
<hi>Barkley</hi> of ... who had been a great
Traveller and long in <hi>Spain,</hi> demanded
his Opinion herein. Mr. <hi>Barkley</hi> answer'd,
That he thought it to be true, and gave a
reason; for that every body for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
from any notable danger, either
of Sickness or otherwise, used to present a
Saint by way of gratuity with a Lamp to
burn before it, and commonly of Silver.
So that before some one Saint, there were
4 or 5 thousand Lamps: His Grace sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Compostella.</hi> And Mr.
<hi>Barkley</hi> affirm'd it of St. <hi>James;</hi> but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
That the Bells in <hi>Spain</hi> and in other
places of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> were few and
small, yet holden to be very powerfull
for driving away the Devils and Evil-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
I upon this recited out of <hi>Gregorius
Turonensis,</hi> the History of <hi>Lupus</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Swessons,</hi> who by sudden ringing of Bells
drave away the Pagan Army of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
besieging that City, having never
heard of a Bell before. Much being then
said of the Nature and Office of <hi>Bells,</hi> his
Grace esteem'd the <hi>Bells</hi> of <hi>England</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
with the Lamps of <hi>Spain;</hi> and
condemning the pulling of them down,
complained of the Deformity they had
thereby brought upon the Churches of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48454:150"/>
                  <hi>Scotland;</hi> saying, That at his being there,
and lodging first at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> he went to
see the Church, which being shew'd unto
him by a crumpt unseemly Person the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
thereof, he asked him how many
Bells they had there? The Minister an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
None. His Grace thinking that
somewhat strange, demanded how it
chanced? The Minister thinking that
Question as strange, reply'd, It was one
of the Reformed Churches. From thence
his Grace went to <hi>Edinborough,</hi> where he
found accordingly no Bell in all the City,
save one only in the Church of St. <hi>Andrew.</hi>
And enquiring, What became of all the
rest? it was told him, That they were
shipp'd to be carried into the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
but were drowned in <hi>Leigh Haven</hi>—I
said, That it was reported, that Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> hearing that Sir <hi>John Shelton</hi>
for want of other Prey, had brought a
Bell from the sacking of <hi>Cales,</hi> was highly
offended at it, and said, <hi>By God's death
she would make him carry it thither again.</hi> I
might have added, that that Peerless Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
was so far against defacing the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Churches, and the pulling down
of Bells and Lead from them, as in the
second Year of her Reign she caused ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Proclamations not only to be printed,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48454:151"/>
but signed them also with her own Hand,
and sent them in that manner (the more
to manifest her Zeal and restrain the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege)
about into the Counties. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I had spoken of sending the Bell
back again, his Grace then requited me
with this Relation.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman (quoth he) of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,
richly married, and of fair Estate
(yet not naming him) shewed me on a
time a piece of Unicorns Horn, Sea Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,
as much as the Cover of a great
Salt-celler (which was then standing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Table before Dinner) was about
at the bottom; the piece of Unicorn's
Horn having a Crucifix graven upon it,
and a gapp in one of the Quarters, where
part had been cut or scrap'd away for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Infirmities. I desired to know of him
where he had it; but he refus'd to tell it
me; till after some pressure he discover'd
to me, That in his Travels beyond the
Seas, he came to a Nunnery, where the
Nuns in courtesie shewing him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of their House, he whilst they heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him not, slipt this into his Pocket and
brought it away. His Grace reproving
him for it, told him, <hi>It was Sacrilege,</hi> and
that although it were superstitiously us'd,
yet it was dedicated unto God, advising
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48454:151"/>
him to use some means for sending it back
again; saying, that the Nuns no doubt
suffer'd great Displeasure from their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bess,
upon the missing of it. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
notwithstanding (quoth his Grace)
refus'd my Counsel; but I observ'd (said
he) that he never prosper'd after, and at
length having consumed his Estate, died
Childless.</p>
               <p>It came not then to my Mind upon
the sudden; but I might very truly have
added the like of Sir <hi>John Shelton,</hi> That
having married the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi>
Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> he died very little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth, and without any Issue (as
I take it) but certainly without any Issue-male
to continue his Family.</p>
               <p>[Subscrib'd] Henry Spelman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Jeremy Stephens being then present,
do testify the truth of this Relation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having made mention of <hi>Cales</hi> and
Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> I will add further what
was lately told me by a Knight of worth
(who was himself in the Voyage) much
conducing to the Honour of that renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Princess, and to the scope also of this
our Discourse. It is said, That when
she set forth her Expedition for <hi>Cales,</hi> or
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48454:152"/>
other <hi>Spanish</hi> Towns, she gave particular
and streight Instructions that in no Case
any Violence should be offered to any
Church or consecrated thing. This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
Sir <hi>Coniers Clifford,</hi> upon
the taking of <hi>Cales,</hi> fired and burnt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral-Church
there; and Sir <hi>Charles
Blunt</hi> (in the return from thence) the
Cathedral-Church of <hi>Pharos</hi> in <hi>Portugal.</hi>
It followed, that Sir <hi>Coniers Clifford</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
after prospered in any thing, and was
at last slain by the Natives in <hi>Ireland,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Son to continue his Nominal-line;
and that Sir <hi>Charles Blunt,</hi> about 2 Years
after the Fact, was drowned at Sea in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
for <hi>Ireland. (Ex relat.</hi> Will. Slingsby
<hi>Mil.</hi> 22. Nov. 1634.)</p>
