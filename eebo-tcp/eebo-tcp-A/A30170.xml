            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>WHen at the first I took my Pen in hand,</l>
               <l>Thus for to write; I did not understand</l>
               <l>That I at all should make a little Book</l>
               <l>In such a mode; Nay, I had undertook</l>
               <l>To make another, which when almost done;</l>
               <l>Before I was aware, I this begun.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And thus it was: I writing of the Way</l>
               <l>And Race of Saints, in this our Gospel-Day,</l>
               <l>Fell suddenly into an Allegory</l>
               <l>About their Journey, and the way to Glory,</l>
               <l>In more than twenty things, which I set down;</l>
               <l>This done, I twenty more had in my Crown,</l>
               <l>And they again began to multiply,</l>
               <l>Like sparks that from the coals of fire do fly.</l>
               <l>Nay then, thought I, if that you breed so fast,</l>
               <l>I'll put you by your selves, lest you at last</l>
               <l>Should prove <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and eat out</l>
               <l>The Book that I already am about.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Well, so I did; but yet I did not think</l>
               <l>To shew to all the World my Pen and Ink</l>
               <l>In such a mode; I only thought to make</l>
               <l>I knew not what: nor did I undertake</l>
               <l>Thereby to please my Neighbour; no not I;</l>
               <l>I did it mine own self to gratifie;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Neither did I but vacant seasons spend</l>
               <l>In this my Scribble; nor did I intend</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:44054:3"/>But to divert my self in doing this,</l>
               <l>From worser thoughts, which make me do amiss.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus I set Pen to Paper with delight,</l>
               <l>And quickly had my thoughts in black and white.</l>
               <l>For having now my Method by the end,</l>
               <l>Still as I pull d, it came; and so I penn'd</l>
               <l>It down, until it came at last to be</l>
               <l>For length and breadth the bigness which you see.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Well, when I had thus put mine ends together,</l>
               <l>I shew'd them others, that I might see whether</l>
               <l>They would condemn them, or them justifie:</l>
               <l>And some said, let them live; some, let them die.</l>
               <l>Some said, <hi>John,</hi> print it; others said, Not so:</l>
               <l>Some said, It might do good; others said, No.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now was I in a straight, and d d not see</l>
               <l>Which was the best thing to be done by me:</l>
               <l>At last I thought, Since you are thus divided,</l>
               <l>I print it will; and so the case decided.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For, thought I; Some, I see, would have it done,</l>
               <l>Though others in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <l>To prove then who advised for the best,</l>
               <l>Thus I thought fit to put it to the test.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I further thought, If now I did deny</l>
               <l>Those that would have it thus, to gratifie,</l>
               <l>I did not know but hinder them I might</l>
               <l>Of that which would to them be great delight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For those that were not for its coming forth,</l>
               <l>I said to them, Offend you I am loth;</l>
               <l>Yet since your Brethren pleased with it be,</l>
               <l>Forbear to judge, till you do further see.</l>

               <l>If that thou wilt not read, let it alone;</l>
               <l>Some love the meat, some love to pick the bone.</l>
               <l>Yea, that I might them better palliate,</l>
               <l>I did too with them thus Expostulate.</l>

               <l>Mine end, thy good? why may it not be done?</l>
               <l>Dark Clouds bring Waters, when the bright bring none</l>
               <l>Yea, dark, or bright, if they their Silver drops</l>

               <l>Gives praise to both, and carpeth not at either,</l>
               <l>But treasures up the Fruit they yield together:</l>
               <l>Yea, so commixes both, that in her Fruit</l>
               <l>None can distinguish this from that, they suit</l>
               <l>Her well, when hungry: but if she be full,</l>
               <l>She spues out both, and makes their blessings null.</l>

                  <hi>Then said</hi> Christian, <hi>What means this?</hi>

Then said <hi>Christian, What means this?</hi> The <hi>Interpreter</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, This is <hi>Christ,</hi> who continually with the Oyl ofhis Grace, maintains the work already begun in the heart; By the means of which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what the Devil can do, the souls of his People' prove gracious<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9</note> still. And in that thou sawest, that the Man stood behind the Wall to maintain the fire; this is to teach thee, that it is hard for the tempted to see how this work of Grace is maintained in the soul.</p>
               <p>I saw also that the <hi>Interpreter</hi> took him again by the hand, and led him into a pleasant place, where was builded a stately Palace, beautiful to behold; at the sight of which, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> was greatly delighted; he saw also upon the top thereof, certain Persons walked, who were cloathed all in Gold. Then said <hi>Christian,</hi> May

we go in thither? Then the <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> took him, and led him up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the door of the Palace; and behold, at the door stood a great Company of men, as desirous to go in, but durst not.

Now was <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> somwhat in a muse: at last, when every Man started back for fear of the Armed Men; <hi>Christian</hi> saw a Man of a very stout countenance come up to the Man that sat there to write; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Set down my name, Sir; the which when he had done, he saw the Man draw his Sword, and put an Helmet upon his Head, and rush toward the door upon the Armed Men, who laid upon him with deadly force; but the Man, not at all discouraged, fell to cutting and hacking most fiercely; so, after he had received and given<note place="margin">Act. 14, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>So he went in, and was cloathed with such Garments as they. Then <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> smiled, and said, I think verily I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Well, said <hi>Christian,</hi> this is fearful; God help me to watch and be sober; and to pray, that I may shun the causes of this mans misery. Sir, is it not time for me to go on my way now?</p>

This night as I was in my sleep, I Dreamed, and behold the Heavens grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding black; also it thundred and lightned in most fearful wise, that it put me into an Agony. So I looked<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> up in my Dream, and saw the Clouds<note place="margin">1 Thcss. 4.</note> rack at an unusual rate; upon which<note place="margin">Jude 15.</note> I heard a great sound of a Trumpet,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 1. 8</note> and saw also a Man sit upon a Cloud,<note place="margin">Joh 5. 28.</note>

               <p>Why I thought that the day of Judgement was come, and that I was not ready for it: but this frighted me most, that the Angels gathered up several, and left me behind; also the pit of Hell opened her mouth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the Judge had always his eye upon me, shewing indignation in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
               <p>Then said the <hi>Interpreter</hi> to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, Hast thou considered all these things?</hi>

               <p>Well, keep all things so in thy mind, that they may be as a <hi>Goad</hi> in thy sides, to prick thee forward in the way thou must go.

Then said the <hi>Interpreter,</hi> The Comforter be always with thee good <hi>Christian,</hi> to guide thee in the way that leads to the City.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Christian</hi> went on his way, saying,</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:44054:23"/>Now I saw in my Dream, that the high way up which <hi>Christian</hi> was to go, was fenced on either side with a Wall, and that Wall is called <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Up this way therefore did burdened <hi>Christian</hi> run, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great difficulty, because of the load on his back.</p>
               <p>He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending; and upon that place stood a <hi>Cross,</hi> and a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the bottom, a Sepulcher. So I saw in my Dream, that just as <hi>Christian</hi> came up with the <hi>Cross,</hi> his burden loosed from off his Shoulders, and fell from off his back; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tumble; and so continued to do, till it came to the mouth of the Sepulcher, where it fell in, and I saw it no more.</p>

                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44054:24"/>I saw then in my Dream that he went on thus, even untill he came at a bottom, where he saw, a little out of the way, three Men fast asleep with Fetters upon their heels. The name of the one was<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Christian</hi> then seeing them lye in this case, went to them, if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture he might awake them. And cryed, You are like them that sleep on the top of a Mast, for the dead Sea is under you, a Gulf that hath no bottom: Awake therefore and come away, be willing also, and I will help you off with your Irons. He also told them, If he that goeth about like a roaring Lion comes by, you will certainly become a prey to his teeth. With that they lookt upon him, and began to reply in this sort:<note n="b" place="margin">There is no persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion will do, is God openeth not the eyes,</note>

And as he was troubled there-about, he espied two Men come tumbling over the Wall, on the left hand of the narrow way; and they made up a pace to him.

I will tell you moreover, that I had then given me a Roll sealed to comfort me by reading, as I go in the way; I was also bid to give it in at the Coelestial Gate, in token of my certain going in after it: all which things I doubt you want, and want them, because you came not in at the Gate.</p>
               <p>To these things they gave him no answer, only they looked upon each other and <hi>laughed.</hi> Then I saw that they went on all, save that <hi>Christian</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:44054:27"/>
kept before, who had no more talk but with himself, and that somtimes sighingly, and sometimes comfortably: also he would be often reading in the Roll that one of the shining ones gave him, by which he was refreshed.</p>
               <p>I beheld then, that they all went on till they came to the foot of an Hill,<note n="g" place="margin">He comes to the hill Difficulty.</note> at the bottom of which was a Spring. There was also in the same place two other ways besides that which came straight from the Gate; one turned to the left hand, and the other to the right, at the bottom of the Hill: but the narrow way lay right up the Hill (and the name of the going up the side of the Hill, is called <hi>Difficulty.</hi>) <hi>Christian</hi> now went to the Spring and drank thereof to refresh himself, and then began to go up the Hill; saying,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>This Hill, though high, I covet to ascend;</l>
                  <l>The difficulty will not me offend;</l>
                  <l>For I perceive the way to life lies here;</l>
                  <l>Come, pluck up, Heart; lets neither faint nor fear:</l>
                  <l>Better, tho difficult, th'right way to go,</l>

               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:44054:27"/>The other two also came to the foot of the Hill. But when they saw that the Hill was steep and high, and that there was two other ways to go; and supposing also, that these two ways might meet again, with that up which <hi>Christian</hi> went, on the other side of the Hill: Therefore they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to go in those ways (now the name of one of those ways was <hi>Danger,</hi> and the name of the other <hi>Destruction.</hi>) So<note n="h" place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>I looked then after <hi>Christian,</hi> to see him go up the Hill, where I perceived he fell from running to going, and from going to clambering upon his hands and his knees, because of the steepness of the place. Now about the midway to the top of the Hill, was a pleasant<note n="i" place="margin">A ward of grace.</note> 
                  <hi>Arbour,</hi> made by the Lord of the Hill, for the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of weary Travailers. Thither therefore <hi>Christian</hi> go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, where also
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44054:28"/>
he sat down to rest him. Then he pull'd his Roll out of his bosom and read therein to his comfort; he also now began afresh to take a review of the Coat or Garment that was given him as he stood by the Cross. Thus pleasing himself a while, he at last fell into a slumber, and thence into a fast sleep, which detained him in that place untill it was almost night, and in his sleep his<note n="i" place="margin">He that sleeps is a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now as he was sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there came one to him &amp; awaked him saying, <hi>Go to the Ant, thou slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, consider her ways and be wise:</hi> and with that <hi>Christian</hi> suddenly star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, and sped him on his way, and went a pace till he came to the top of the Hill.</p>
               <p>Now when he was got up to the top of the Hill, there came two Men running against him amain; the name of the one was <hi>Timorus,</hi> and the name of the other <hi>Mistrust.</hi> To whom <hi>Christian</hi> said, Sirs, what's the matter you run the wrong way? <hi>Timorus</hi> answered, That they were going to the City of <hi>Zion,</hi> and had got up that <hi>difficult</hi> place; but, said he, the further we go, the more danger we

meet with, wherefore we turned, and are going back again.</p>
               <p>Yes, said <hi>Mistrust,</hi> for just before us lye a couple of Lyons in the way, whether sleeping or wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we know not; and we could not think, if we came within reach, but they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Chr.</speaker>
               <p>Then said <hi>Christian,</hi> You make me afraid, but whither shall I fly to be safe? If I go back to mine own Countrey, <hi>That</hi> is prepared for Fire and Brimstone; and I shall certainly perish there. If I can get to the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial City, I am sure to be in safety there. I must venture: To go back is nothing but death, to go forward is fear of death, and life everlasting beyond it. I will yet go forward. So <hi>Mistrust</hi> and <hi>Timorus</hi> ran down the Hill; and <hi>Christian</hi> went on his way.

Here therefore he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be much perplexed, and knew not what to do; at last he bethought himself that he had slept in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> that is on the side of the Hill: and falling down upon his knees, he asked God forgiveness for that his foolish Fact; and then went back to look for his Roll. But all the way he went back, who can sufficiently set forth the sorrow of <hi>Christians</hi> heart? somtimes he sighed, somtimes he wept, and often times he chid himself, for being so foolish to fall asleep in that place which was erected only for a little refreshment from his weariness. Thus therefore he went back; carefully looking on this side, and on that, all the way as he went, if happily he might find his Roll, that had been his comsort so many times in his Journey. He went thus till he came again within sight of the <hi>Arbour,</hi> whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ase to my flesh, which the Lord of the Hill hath erected only for the relief of the spirits of Pilgrims! How many steps have I took in vain! (Thus it happened to <hi>Israel</hi> for their sin, they were sent back again by the way of the Red-Sea) and I am made to tread those steps with sorrow, which I might have trod with delight, had it not been for this sinful sleep. How far might I have been on my way by this time! I am made to tread those steps thrice over, which I needed not to have trod but once: Yea now also I am like to be benighted, for the day is almost spent. O that I had not slept! Now by this time he was come to the <hi>Arbour</hi> again, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> for a while he sat down and wept, but at last (as <hi>Christian</hi> would have it) looking sorrowfully down under the Settle, there he espied his Roll; the which he with trembling and haste catch't up, and put it into his bosom; but who can tell how joyful this Man was, when he had gotten his Roll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain!
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44054:30"/>
For this Roll was the assurance of his life and acceptance at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Haven. Therefore he laid it up in his bosom, gave thanks to God for directing his eye to the place where it lay, and with joy and tears be took him self again to his Journey. But Oh how nimbly now, did he go up the rest of the Hill! Yet before he got up, the Sun went down upon <hi>Christian;</hi> and this made him again recall the vanity of his sleeping to his remembrance, and thus he again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to condole with himself: <hi>Ah thou sinful sleep! how for thysake am I like to be benighted in my Journey! I must walk without the Sun, darkness must cover the path of my foet, and I must hear the noise of doleful Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of my sinful sleep!</hi> Now also he remembred the story that <hi>Mistrust</hi> and <hi>Timorus</hi> told him of, how they were frighted with the sight of the Lions. Then said <hi>Christian</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self again, These Beasts range in the night for their prey, and if they should meet with me in the dark, how should I shift them! how should I escape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them torn pieces? Thus he went on his way, but while he was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44054:30"/>
thus bewayling his unhappy miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he lift up his eyes, and behold there was a very stately Palace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, the name whereof was <hi>Beautiful,</hi> and it stood just by the High-way side.</p>
               <p>So I saw in my Dream, that he made haste and went forward, that if possible he might get Lodging there; now before he had gone far, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a very narrow passage, which was about a furlong off of the Porters Lodge, and looking very narrowly before him as he went, he espied two Lions in the way. Now, thought he, I see the dangers that <hi>Mistrust</hi> and <hi>Timorus,</hi> were driven back by. (The Lions were Chained, but he saw not the Chains) Then he was afraid, and thought also himself to go back after them, for he thought nothing but death was before him: But the <hi>Porter</hi> at the Lodge, whose name is<note n="m" place="margin">Mar. 13</note> 
                  <hi>Watchful,</hi> perceiving that <hi>Christian</hi> made a halt, as if he would go back, cried unto him, saying, Is thy strength so small? fear not the Lions, for they are Chained: and are pla ed there for trial of faith where it is; and for discovery of those that

have none: keep in the midst of the Path, and no hurt shall come unto thee.</p>
               <p>Then I saw that he went on, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for fear of the Lions; but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good heed to the directions of the <hi>Porter;</hi> he heard them roar, but they did him no harm. Then he clapt his hands, and went on, till he came and stood before the Gate where the <hi>Porter</hi> was. Then said <hi>Christian</hi> to the <hi>Porter,</hi> Sir, What house is this? and may I lodge here to night? The <hi>Porter</hi> answered, This House was built by the Lord of the Hill: and he built it for the relief and security of Pilgrims.

               <p>Then she asked him whence he was, and whither he was going, and he told her.

So she smiled, but the water stood in her eyes: And after a little pause, she said, I will call forth two or three more of the Family.

               <p>No, he took me and had me where he shewed me a stately Palace, and how the People were clad in Gold that were in it; and how there came a venturous Man, and cut his way through the armed men that stood in the door to keep him out; and how he was bid to come in, and win eternal Glory.

               <p>Saw! Why I went but a little further, and I saw one, as I thought in my mind, hang bleeding upon the Tree; and the very sight of him made my burden fall olf my back (for I groaned under a weary burden) but then it fell down from off me. 'T was a strange thing to me, for I never saw such a thing before: Yea, and while I stood looking up, (for then I could not forbear looking) three shining ones came to me: one of them testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that my sins were forgiven me;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44054:34"/>
another stript me of my Rags, and gave me this Broidred Coat which you see; and the third set the mark which you see, in my forehead, and gave me this sealed Roll (and with that he plucked it out of his bosom.)</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now I saw in my Dream, that thus
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44054:35"/>
they sat talking together untill sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was ready. So when they had made ready, they sat down to meat; Now the Table was furnished<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>What</hi> Christian <hi>had to his supper.</hi>
                  </note> with fat things, and with Wine that was well refined; and all their talk<note n="l" place="margin">Their talk at supper time</note> at the Table, was about the Lord of the Hill: As namely, about what he had done, and wherefore he did what he did, and why he had builded that House: and by what they said, I perceived that he had been a <hi>great Warriour,</hi> and had fought with and slain him that had the power of death, but not without great danger to himself, which made me love him the more.</p>
               <p>For, as they said, and as I believe (said <hi>Christian</hi>) he did it with the loss of much blood; but that which put Glory of Grace into all he did, was, that he did it of pure love to his Countrey. And besides, there were some of them of the House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that said, they had seen and spoke with him since he did dye on the Cross; and they have attested, that they had it from his own lips, that he is such a lover of poor Pilgrims,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44054:36"/>
that the like is not to be found from the East to the West</p>
               <p>They moreover gave an instance of what they affirmed, and that was, He had stript himself of his glory that he might do this for the Poor; and that they heard him say and affirm, That he would not dwell in the Mountain of <hi>Zion</hi> alone. They said moreover, That he had made many Pilgrims<note n="a" place="margin">Christ makes Princes of Beggars.</note> Princes, though by nature they were Beggars born, and their original had been the Dunghil.</p>
               <p>Thus they discoursed together till late at night, and after they had committed themselves to their Lord for Protection, they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to rest. The Pilgrim they laid in a large upper <note place="margin">Christians <hi>Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                  </note> Chamber, whose window opened towards the Sun ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; the name of the Chamber was <hi>Peace,</hi> where he slept till break of day; and then he awoke and sang,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Where am I now! is this the love and care</l>
                  <l>Of Jesus, for the men that Pilgrims are!</l>
                  <l>Thus to provide! That I should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given!</l>
                  <l>And dwell already the next door to Heaven.</l>

               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:44054:36"/>So in the Morning they all got up, and after some more discourse, they told him that he should not depart, till they had shewed him the <hi>Rarities</hi> of that place. And first they had him into the Study,<note n="c" place="margin">Christian <hi>had into the Study, and what he saw there.</hi>
                  </note> where they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him Records of the greatest Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; in which, as I remember my Dream, they shewed him first the Pedigree of the Lord of the Hill, that he was the Son of the Ancient of Days, and came by an eternal Generation. Here also was more fully Recorded the Acts that he had done, and the names of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds that he had taken into his service; and how he had placed them in such Habitations that could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by length of Days nor decaies of Nature, be dissolved.</p>
               <p>Then they read to him some of the worthy Acts that some of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had done. As how they had subdued Kingdoms, wrought Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, obtained Promises, stopped the mouths of Lions, quenched the<note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 11. 33, 34.</note> violence of Fire, escaped the edge of the Sword; out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Aliens.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:44054:37"/>Then they read again in another part of the Records of the House, where it was shewed how willing their Lord was to receive into his favour any, even any, though they in time past had offered great affronts to his Person and proceedings. Here also were several other Histories of many other famous things, of all which <hi>Christian</hi> had a view. As of things both Ancient and Modern; together with Prophecies and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of things that have their certain accomplishment, both to the dread and amazement of enemies, and the comfort and solace of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims.</p>
               <p>The next day they took him and had him into the<note n="e" place="margin">Christian <hi>had into the Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>

And there was here enough of this to harness out as many men for the service of their Lord, as there be Stars in the Heaven for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:44054:37"/>They also shewed him some of the Engines with which some of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had done wonderful things.<note n="f" place="margin">Christian <hi>is made to see Ancient things.</hi>
                  </note> They shewed him <hi>Moses</hi> Rod, the Hammer and Nail with which <hi>Jael</hi> slew <hi>Sisera,</hi> the Pitchers, Trumpets, and Lamps too, with which <hi>Gideon</hi> put to flight the Armies of <hi>Midi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>.</hi> Then they shewed him the Oxes goad wherewith <hi>Shamger</hi> slew six hundred men. They shewed him also the Jaw bone with which <hi>Sampson</hi> did such mighty feats; they shewed him moreover the Sling and Stone with which <hi>David</hi> slew <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath:</hi> and the Sword also with which their Lord will kill the Man of Sin, in the day that he shall rise up to the prey. They shewed him besides many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things, with which <hi>Christian</hi> was much delighted. This done, they went to their rest again.</p>
               <p>Then I saw in my Dream, that on the morrow he got up to go forwards, but they desired him to stay till the next day also, and then said they, we will, if the day be clear, shew you the<note n="g" place="margin">Christian <hi>shewed the delectable Mountains</hi>

Then he asked the name of the Countrey, they said it was <hi>Immanuels Land:</hi> and it is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Again, behold on the left hand, there was a very dangerous Quagg, into which, if even a good Man falls, he can find no bottom for his foot to stand on; Into that Quagg <hi>King</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>once did fall,</hi> and had no doubt therein been smothered, had not He that is able, pluckt him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:44054:45"/>The path-way was here also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding narrow, and therefore good <hi>Christian</hi> was the more put to it; for when he sought in the dark to shun the ditch on the one hand, he was ready to tip over into the mire on the other; also when he sought to escape the mirc, without great carefulness he would be ready to fall into the ditch. Thus he went on, and I heard him here sigh bitterly: for besides the dangers mentioned above, the path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way was here so dark, that oft times when he lift up his foot to set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he knew not where, or upon what he should set it next.</p>
               <p>About the midst of this Valley, I perceived the mouth of Hell to be, and it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>tood also hard by the way side: Now thought <hi>Christian,</hi> what shall I do? And ever and anon the flame and smoak would come out in such abundance, with sparks and hideousnoises, (things that cared not for <hi>Christians</hi> Sword, as did <hi>Apollyon</hi> before) that he was forced to put up his Sword, and betake himself to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother weapon called<note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 6. 18</note>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44054:46"/>
took notice that now poor <hi>Christian</hi> was so confounded, that he did not know his own voice: and thus I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it: Just when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> was come over against the mouth of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pit, one of the wicked ones got behind him, and stept up softly to him, and whisperingly suggested ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grievous blasphemies to him, which he<note n="a" place="margin">Christian <hi>made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he spake blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when 't was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan that suggested them into his mind.</hi>
                  </note> verily thought had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his own mind. This put <hi>Christian</hi> more to it than any thing that he met with before, even to think that he should now blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him that he loved so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet could he have helped it, he would not have done it: but he had not the discretion neither to stop his ears, nor to know from whence those blasphemies came.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Christian</hi> had travelled in this disconsolate condition some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time, he thought he heard the voice of a man, as going before him, saying, <hi>Though I walk through</hi>

                  <hi>the valley of the shaddow of death, I will fear none ill, for thou art with me.</hi>

               <p>Then was he glad, and that for these reasons:</p>
               <p n="1">First, Because he gathered from

               <p n="3">Thirdly, For that he hoped (could he over-take them) to have compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by and by. So he went on, and<note place="margin">Amos 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>First, The Pilgrims were cloathed with such kind of Rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ent, as was<note place="margin">The first cause of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ent of any that Traded in that <hi>fair.</hi> The people therefore of the <hi>fair</hi> made a great gazing upon them: Some said they were Fools, some they were Bedlams, and some they are Outlandish-men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And as they wondred<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 7, 8.</note> at their Apparel, so they did likewise<note place="margin">2d Cause of the hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub.</note> at their Speech, for few could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what they said; they natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally spoke the Language of <hi>Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

but they that kept the <hi>fair,</hi> were the men of this World: So that from one end of the <hi>fair</hi> to the other, they seemed <hi>Barbarians</hi> each to the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But that which did not a little amuse the Merchandizers, was, that these Pilgrims set very light by all their Wares, they cared not, so much as to look upon them: and if they called upon them to buy, they would put their fingers in their ears, and cry, <hi>Turn away mine eyes from</hi>

or save his life. But yet I think meet to instruct you into our Law.</p>
               <p>There was an Act made in the days of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the Great, Servant to our<note place="margin">Exod. 1.</note> Prince, That lest those of a contrary Religion should multiply and grow too strong for him, their Males should be thrown into the River.

Now the substance of these Laws this Rebel has broken, not only in thought (which is not to be born) but also in word and deed; which must therefore needs be intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>
               <p>For that of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> his Law was made upon a supposition, to prevent mischief, no Crime being yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent; but here is a Crime appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

               <p>I saw also in my Dream, that when the Shepherds perceived that they were way-fairing men, they also put questions to them, (to which they made answer as in other places,) as, Whence came you? and, How got you into the way? and, By what means

               </p>
               <p>The Shepherds, I say, whose names were, <hi>Knowledge, Experience, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and <hi>Sincere,</hi> took them by the hand, and had them to their Tents, and made them pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Then I saw in my Dream, that in the morning, the Shepherds called up <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Hopeful</hi> to walk with them upon the Mountains: So they went forth with them, and walked a while, having a pleasant prospect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Pilgrims some wonders? So when they had concluded to do it, they had them first to the top of an Hill<note place="margin">

So <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> and <hi>Hopeful</hi> lookt down, and saw at the bottom several men dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all to pieces by a fall that they had from the top. Then said <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> What meaneth this? The Shepherds answered; Have you not heard of them that were made to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Shepherds then answered, Did you not see a little below these Mountains a <hi>Stile</hi> that led into a Meadow on the left hand of this way? They answered, Yes. Then said the Shepherds, From that Stile the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Then I saw in my Dream, that the Shepherds had them to another place, in a bottom, where was a door in the side of an Hill; and they opened the door, and bid them look in. They looked in therefore, and saw that within it was very dark, and smoaky; they also thought that they heard there a lumbring noise as of fire, and a cry of some tormented, and that they smelt the scent of Brimstone. Then said <hi>Christian, What means this?</hi> The Shepherds told them, saying, This is a By-way to Hell, a way that<note place="margin">A by-way to Hell.</note> Hypocrites go in at; namely, such as sell their Birth-right, with <hi>Esau:</hi> such as sell their Master, with <hi>Judas:</hi> such as blaspheme the Gospel, with <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander:</hi> and that lie and dissemble, with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife.</p>

               <p>By this time the Pilgrims had a desire to go forwards, and the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds a desire they should; so they walked together towards the end of the Mountains.

               <p>When <hi>Christian</hi> saw that the man<note place="margin">Pr. 26. 12.</note> was wise in his own conceit, he said to <hi>Hopeful,</hi> whisperingly, <hi>There is more hopes of a fool then of him.</hi> And said moreover, <hi>When he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom</hi>

that he is a fool.</hi> What, shall we talk<note place="margin">How to carry it to a fool.</note> further with him? or out-go him at present? and so leave him to think of what he hath heard already; and then stop again for him afterwards, and see if by degrees we can do any good of him?</p>

               <p>So they both went on, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he came after.
