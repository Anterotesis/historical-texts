            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The TRANSLATOR</head>
            <p>WIllingly I would omit this entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my Reader; for if he be onely a pretender to conception, hee will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to conceive me howsoever: If re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ingenious he needes no preparative, unlesse he be a Crittique, and then he deserves not any thing, because hee will bee satisfied with nothing. But <hi>Custome</hi> exacts <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and I pay my tribute, lest I should be thought proud or foolish, that I either would not, or could not give an account of my elections.</p>
            <p>That I pitched upon the <hi>Fourth Booke</hi> of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> and singled it from the rest, was by such a Comands as (like coelestiall influences) did not violently inforce, but strongly incline my will:
<pb facs="tcp:20008:5"/>
Reason assuring me, I might justifie my <hi>obedience,</hi> and quote <hi>Virgil</hi> for it; himselfe having first read to <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> the <hi>Second, This,</hi> and the <hi>Sixt Booke;</hi> And so intire a worke I doe esteeme this Booke, as while it remaines solitary, I presume to: give it the Title of <hi>DIDO and AENEAS:</hi> wherein I prefixe her name, and would adde my reasons; but I imagine no man will quarrell with a Lady for place: much lesse with a <hi>Queene</hi> in her owne Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Opinion the common <hi>game</hi> that Muses fly at, hath not raised mine upon the wing. Of a noble <hi>Fame</hi> who covets not the purchase? it is a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some <hi>ayre,</hi> and breathes <hi>new spirits</hi> into a man; but mutable <hi>Opinion</hi> is <hi>winde,</hi> and I would not rashly carve Letters on a <hi>Wether-cocke:</hi> I write lower,
<pb facs="tcp:20008:5"/>
therefore safer, couching my <hi>Name</hi> under the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Maro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not offer to defend my <hi>Authour,</hi> that were to present <hi>succours</hi> to a <hi>Prince</hi> reigning in full <hi>peace,</hi> the Prince of the Latin Poets. If any should question him for the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>History,</hi> the verse is transparent, they may onely intend their sight, and looke quite through the <hi>Fained worke:</hi> and in the Founders of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> they shall read the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their <hi>Foundations,</hi> the <hi>Foeminine</hi> and <hi>Masculine</hi> governements of those two great Citties, by <hi>Merchandise,</hi> and <hi>Armes;</hi> And if it be a fiction that <hi>Aeneas</hi> ever saw <hi>Dido,</hi> it is true that <hi>Rome</hi> fell into the power of <hi>Carthage,</hi> till by a Faction growing in the bosome of this State, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
<pb facs="tcp:20008:6"/>
like a love-sicke Lady, to trust it selfe in the armes and imbrace of <hi>Rome,</hi> that would seeme commanded by Fate to breake all mutuall tyes; till cursing the <hi>Roman</hi> false-hood, the reputation and spirit of poore <hi>Carthage</hi> glided into winde.</p>
            <p>In Englishing <hi>Virgil,</hi> I have given him a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, not <hi>so low</hi> as to bring downe his <hi>Aeneis</hi> to his <hi>Eclogues,</hi> and levell the expressions of his Princes with his Shepheards: nor <hi>so high,</hi> that he should not be intelligible to the Vnlearned, as if he still spake <hi>Latin.</hi> It is true that wit distilled in one language, cannot be transfused into another without losse of spirits: yet I presume such graces are retained, as those of the Noblest quality will favour this <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,</hi> from an <hi>Original,</hi> that was somtimes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envied Favorite of the greatest Roman Emperour.</p>

               <l>Happy, alas too happy, if from <hi>Troy</hi>

               <l>No ship had euer touch'd our shore. Thus she,</l>
               <l>Kissing the bed, dye unreveng'd shall we?</l>
               <l>But let vs dye, she sayd, thus, thus tis due.</l>
               <l>This <hi>fire</hi> from Sea may the fell <hi>Trojan</hi> view,</l>

               <l>The noise through Courts, &amp; through the City flows</l>
               <l>(All trembling) this sad newes. The buildings sound</l>

The wofull cries. No lesse then were old <hi>Tyre,</hi>

               <l>Beating her brest, forcing her face to bleed,</l>
               <l>Breakes through them: cals her dying by her name,</l>

               <l>This with these hands pil'd I? invoke did I</l>

The <hi>Tyrian</hi> Lords and Commons and I found</l>
               <l>Death in thy death: water, I'le bath her wound:</l>
               <l>And with these lips, if her, last breath yet spends,</l>
               <l>I'le gather it. This sayd, the steps sh'ascends.</l>
               <l>Her halfe-dead fister in her bosome cheeres:</l>
               <l>And sighing with her robe the blacke gore cleares,</l>
               <l>Straite <hi>Dido</hi> opes her eyes, with Death opprest,</l>
               <l>And closes them. The deepe wound grates her brest.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Thrice on her elbow leauing, she would rise,</l>

               <l>Sought high heav'ns light, &amp; having found it, gron'd,</l>
               <l>Great <hi>Iuno</hi> then her tedious paines bemon'd:</l>
