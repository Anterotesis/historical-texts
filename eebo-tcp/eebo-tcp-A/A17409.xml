            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this small
Treatise, seeing the
bare name of him
that was the cheife
Author therof, I suppose may be enough
to obtaine sufficient esteeme for it, with
those that haue knowne him, either by
his learned writings, or powerfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.
Nor of Apologie for my selfe in
aduenturing to cast this little mite into
the Lords Treasury from him that
hath beene able to giue such abundance
in greater Volumes, seeing it pleased
<pb facs="tcp:20207:3"/>
him to commit vnto my care both this
and other of his labours, earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that if there were any thing found
among his writings, that might bee
thought profitable for the publike good,
I should vse my best endeauour to haue
it published; I haue therefore thought
it my duty to the liuing if not to the
dead, that the end aymed at by him
might not be frustrated: Some of his
workes haue beene published since his
death, and more haue beene long since
ready for the Presse; which I hope shall
ere long come forth. I know it was the
Authors purpose to haue made a more
compleate and exact Catechisme if the
Lord had prolonged his life; but he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
finished his allotted taske, God
tooke him home to rest from all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
howeuer it was his desire in the
meane time to publish these short
grounds, for the benefit of the younger
sort, which are very briefely propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the helpe of memory, and
<pb facs="tcp:20207:3"/>
most easie and plaine for vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the most simple; and yet if wee
marke them, wee may perceiue very
much matter comprehended in a few
words. It comes vnto thine hands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
for the most part as it was left
by him, very little being added or
altered; the whole frame I haue cast
into a short Table at the beginning,
to the end the learner may first see
and learne the whole methode and
substance in a few words; as also I haue
set downe the substance (at least) of
those speciall proofes that confirme
these Principles; to the end thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
saue thy labour for searching the
places of Scripture quoted, as also
that such as learne the Answeres, they
may by degrees learne also, and know
the words of the chiefe proofes; for
by this meanes they may profit more
soundly, when their faith shall bee
grounded not vpon the weake founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of humane Authoritie; but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:20207:4"/>
the most perfect and sure words of
God; learne them therefore diligently,
and the Lord giue thee vnderstanding
in all things.</p>
