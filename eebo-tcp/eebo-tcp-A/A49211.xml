         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the late Attempt Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Perſon of <hi>William</hi> Prince
of <hi>Furſtemberg,</hi> Plenipotentiary for
the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> in the very
City of <hi>Cologne</hi> it ſelf, the Place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the Treaty of Peace,
hath been done by ſome of the Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
belonging to the Regiment of <hi>Grana,</hi> one of
the Regiments of the Imperial Army; yet the King
of <hi>France</hi> would not at firſt look upon the Emperor,
as being the Author of ſo Odious an Action, his
Majeſty ever reflecting on himſelf, and knowing, that
nothing in the World ought to be held ſo Sacred
and Inviolable among Kings and Soveraigns, as the
true and exact obſervation of their Word. He
thought he ſhould do too great an Injury to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majeſty, by believing him capable of viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
by ſo horrid an Act, a Faith he had ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given, not only to the whole Empire at the Diet
of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> but even to all <hi>Europe,</hi> for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Neutrality of a Town, from whence all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome
did expect a happy Calm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100138:3"/>
It was in that Proſpect, and for no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
that his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty did ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
his juſt Reſentment of ſuch an Attempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill willing to give the Emperor time to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that it was done without his Order, glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expecting to ſee the Chaſtiſement he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
on the Offendors, to waſh away the Blur they
had made on his Reputation, by doing which, the
Emperor would have made it appear to the
World, that his Intention was not to infract the
Publick Faith, nor hinder the preſent Negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Peace. For theſe Reaſons, his Majeſty
forbore commanding his Ambaſſadors away from
<hi>Cologne,</hi> though the Neutrality of that Town, ſo
lately violated, afforded him ground lawful enough,
to fear they could not remain there any longer with
Safety. And indeed, that which his Majeſty ſo
juſtly feared, hath ſince prov'd but too true in the
ſequel, the ſame Security which was violated before
on the Perſon of a Publick Miniſter belonging to a
Prince Allied to his Majeſty, was ſoon broken afreſh
on that of his own Ambaſſadors, in the ſame Place,
their Liveries and other Equippages having been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
Arreſted, and a great and conſiderable Sum
of Moneys belonging to his Majeſty, ſeaz'd on, and
detain'd forcibly, by Order from the Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the ſaid Regiment of <hi>Grana,</hi> the ſaid
Moneys being Loaded on one of their own Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons.
And all this done in a City, in which Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Liberty is allow'd, common to all the
World: having beſides, caus'd an Expreſs, ſent by
the Count <hi>de Chamilly</hi> to the ſaid Ambaſſadors, to be
both Arreſted and Searcht. In a word, <hi>Cologne</hi>
which till then, had been Conſecrated for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Security of all <hi>Europe,</hi> is by a monſtrous Change,
become on a ſuddain, a moſt Bloody Theater,
where on thoſe very Troops deſigned for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Neutrality of the Place, being by the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100138:3"/>
Magiſtrates of the ſame, Sworn to keep and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, have ſince exerciſed with Impunity, all
the Outrages and Violences that both Avarice and
Revenge can inſpire. Notwithſtanding all which,
his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty hath hitherto forborn im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
the leaſt of thoſe Exorbitancies to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
Orders, as being ſtill willing to perſwade
himſelf, out of the Concern he hath for his Glory,
that they were attempted without any Intent of his
Imperial Majeſty. But now ſince the Anſwer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to the Miniſters of <hi>Sweden,</hi> makes
it appear evidently, that the Forcible Stealing away
of the ſaid Prince <hi>William,</hi> was really an Effect of
the Emperors Order and expreſs Command, his
Majeſty of <hi>France</hi> can no longer doubt, but what
hath been done ſince to his Miniſters at <hi>Cologne,</hi>
hath been a following Conſequence, of the ſelf ſame
Orders and Directions. His Majeſty therefore, both
in conſideration of that he owes to himſelf, and
what the ſecurity of his Ambaſſadors requires of
him in this Conjuncture, hath thought it not fit to
leave them any longer expoſed to theſe Violences,
which will doubtleſs raiſe the juſt Indignation, as
well as the Wonder of all <hi>Europe.</hi> Thereupon, his
Majeſty hath at the ſame time Commanded them to
inform the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Miniſters, (who during the whole
Treaty, have exerciſed the Mediation of the King
their Maſter, by whoſe Great and Prudent Care, the
ſaid Aſſembly was convok'd together) of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
he hath taken to Re-call them home. The
ſaid Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sweden,</hi> having hitherto been
Eye-witneſſes, of thoſe facil Means and Expedients
his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty hath from time to time
Propounded, for the making the ſaid Negociation to
take Effect: as on the contrary, they have ſeen what
violent Courſes have been uſed by the Emperor all
along, to hinder and ſtop the Progreſs of the ſame;
It's but Reaſon they ſhould likewiſe ſee, what juſt and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100138:4"/>
lawful Grounds do now oblige him to draw a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
Revenge upon his Enemies by force of
Armes, for the ſlight account made by them of
what ought to be moſt Sacred, not among Princes
onely, but even among all Men; and by the ſame
Force to compel them to Seek a Peace, they now
ſtrive to Hinder, by Means ſo Unjuſt and Unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable.
Would the whole Empire but ſeriouſly
reflect on the Emperors Conduct in this Conjuncture,
it would evidently appear, that it includes in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
many Siniſter Deſigns, which muſt needs
prove fatal to her Liberty, if not timely preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
there being nothing that diſcovers more
the Injuſtice of a Deſign, than the odiouſneſs
of the means practiſed for the effecting of it. Had
the Emperor therefore been leſs concerned than he
was, in his hindring the Aſſembly at <hi>Cologne,</hi> from
producing a Peace, he would never have had recourſe
to ſuch Practiſes, as muſt of neceſſity Diſſolve the
ſtricteſt Ties and Bounds of all Humane Society: he
would not have Violated the Neutrality of a Place
appointed for the Treaty, by his Inſults on the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Ambaſſadors of <hi>France:</hi> he would not, I
ſay, have ſuffered his Officers and Commanders to
ſeize forcibly and violently on Monies appertaining
to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, within the Walls of
a Free City; but in a word, would have Acted in
this Conjuncture, with more Candor and more Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,
and in a War he hath raſhly Declared
againſt him; at leaſt, if he had feared leſs than he
ſeems to do, the end and conſequences of it.</p>
            <p>All the while the Conferences laſted at <hi>Cologne,</hi>
and the Mediators indeavored to bring together the
moſt Refractory Parties concerned; the Emperor
alone, who fearing to ſee himſelf Diſarmed by a
Peace, and conſequently made to loſe that Power,
he had uſurped ſince the year laſt paſt, of Quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Troops indifferently, and Conqueror like,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100138:4"/>
in the Territories of all the Princes of the Empire,
thereby ſtrengthning his Armies at their Coſts and
Charges, by all which proceedings he did openly
Contervene and Infringe, under vain and ſpecious
Pretences, the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and raiſing
again a Power, heretofore ſo formidable to the
<hi>German</hi> Liberty, and which Power could never be
reduced to any lawful Limits, but after ſo many
long and Bloody-wars. To add no more, the ſaid
Emperor dreaded nothing more, than to ſee by the
Concluſion of a Peace at <hi>Cologne,</hi> the end of a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
meerly a Stranger to the Concern of the Empire,
prove the End and Stop of thoſe Deſigns he hath
fram'd againſt the very Empire it ſelf.</p>
            <p>All theſe things duely Weighed, his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Majeſty doubts not, but that not onely the
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> himſelf, whoſe Honor is found ſo
highly concerned in this Breach of a Faith, of which
he was made Depoſitory as Chief Mediator,
but even all other Princes concerned, and ſenſibly
toucht with a Deſire of Peace, will not fail to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to the Emperor, and him onely, the unhappy
Diſſolution of an Aſſembly that was both capable
and likely, to have procured it to all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>The whole Empire may one day Remember,
that her Tranquility might eaſily have been reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
had the Emperor brought to the Treaty, the
ſame Candid and Sincere Diſpoſitions, that his
moſt Chriſtian Majeſty hath ſhewed all along, in and
ſince the late Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia;</hi> and that had
his Imperial Majeſty conſented to Ingage his Word,
not to Aſſiſt at all the Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> his moſt
Chriſtian Majeſty would freely have Obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to have cauſed his Armies to quit <hi>Germany</hi>
at the ſame time, as ſoon as he ſhould have received
the ſaid Promiſe from him. However, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
notwithſtanding what hath paſt hitherto, does
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100138:5"/>
ſtill retain the ſame Sentiments for Peace he had
before: The juſt Reaſons that made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
a War, have not, nor do not leſſen or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
any thing of his firſt Inclination, towards
the Quiet and Calm of the Empire: And what ever
Happy Succeſs he juſtly hopes, God may pleaſe to
Crown his Arms with, he ſhall never think them
more happy, than when they ſhall reduce his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to deſire a Durable Peace.</p>
