            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER, grace and peace from Christ our Lord &amp; Saviour.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo sorts of adversaries, the Church still hath among men. The one, of such as be without: the other, of such as arise from within the Church it self. Both heavie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but the latter, far the more grievous, many wayes. By both of them haue we (as others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs) ben exercised, a long time, and in straunge maner. Yet in and against them all, hath the Lord by his power and of his mercy hitherto preserved vs, and I trust will so do vnto the end.</p>
            <p>Of late hath risen vp one <hi>Thomas White,</hi> despitefully reviling vs, and wickedly blaspheming the Name and tabernacle of the Lord. A man, that was himself here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore separated from the Church of England, holding the Prelacy Ministery worship and confusion thereof to be antichristian: VVho also was a joyned member of a Church in the VVest parts of England professing the same faith with vs: And afterward coming over to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and desiring to be partaker of the Lords supper with vs, did in our publick meeting before vs all, with his owne mouth, testify his consent with vs in the same faith we professe: From which he is now revolted: and of which he is become a notable adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie: setting himself tooth and nayle (what he can) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs and our cause: and that both privately &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly, as now himself hath manifested to the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20072:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>So as in himself (though it may seem straunge) are found both <hi>the extremities,</hi> whereof he speaketh in his Preface, <hi>which bring no small annoyance to the Church of God, hypocrisie, and prophanenes.</hi> His <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> now layd open, in the particulars aforesaid, and many other knowen vnto vs concerning him. His <hi>prophanenes,</hi> plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, both in forsaking the truth of Christ (as Esau sold his birthright for a messe of pottage) and in oppugning it in this maner:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.33.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16.</note> which sheweth in him a despising, if not a despiting also of the trueth: as Esau contemned the birthright, when he had sold it.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>the instance,</hi> which he would falsely give in others, may fitly be observed in himself, for both the extremities aforesaid: As also that <hi>howsoever they seem to differ the one from the other, yet indeed they strengthen &amp; harden each other, with a mutuall reciprocation, and proceed also the one from the other, howsoever for a while envy do cloak it self vnder the name of zeale &amp;c.</hi> VVhich that it may yet the better appeare both in and from himself, I will here set down a letter of his, written while he held our cause, to a Minister of the Church of England: And (to vse his owne wordes) as Christ alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pharisees,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Sir, the pillars of the kingdome of darknes haue ben especially three, ignorance, falsehood, and violence. How far your self have waded with others in these, in your late dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, by sermons conference &amp; letters, let the sequele shew.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the first, you in conference at W.VV. would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove the reading Ministery to be a true Ministery,<note place="margin">Ignorance.</note> though you refused to iustify your owne, and that by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Whosoever preaches the Gospell is a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, but the reading Minister preach the Gospell, Therefore a true Minister.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For answer to your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I denyed the first propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in that sence as you took <hi>preaching</hi> for any publishing of the Gospel, which you presently left without defence. But if the reading Ministery be a true Ministery, then is it the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and if it be the ordinance of God, then may not the Magistrate remove such a Ministery vnder any pretence without sinne. An ignorant Proctor, for an ignorant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, an vnfit tyme for such a doctrine of desolation, to keep darknes still in the Land, when the Lord hath shaken his sword against it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Your ignorance further appeares in the expounding of the parable you entreated on <hi>Math. 13.24.1.</hi> In expounding
<pb facs="tcp:20072:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(<hi>field</hi>) for the Church, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as, though there by (<hi>kingdome of heaven</hi>) be meant the Church, yet by (<hi>field</hi>) must be meant <hi>the world,</hi> for the kingdome of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in the (<hi>field</hi>) except the Church should be in the Church, or our Saviours exposition were vntrue, <hi>verse 38.</hi> where <hi>field</hi> is expounded to be the <hi>world.</hi> 2. In that you would vndertake to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a dark para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not by playne places of Scripture, but contrary to the tenour of the Scriptures, and ordinance of God both in Church &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, for if by (<hi>tares</hi>) be meant open offenders, which may not be plucked vp, then may not open offenders be cast out in the Church, nor put to death by the Magistrate.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You said in conference <hi>that all that preached the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> Act. 8.4. <hi>had extraordinary gifts,</hi> which you went about thus to prove. <hi>Philip.</hi> Act. 8.5. <hi>had extraordinary gifts, therefore all the rest had.</hi> Which argument you could not then nor ever will be able to prove, the very recitall of it is sufficient answer vnto it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And your insufficiency was even confessed by <note n="*" place="margin">Mr Sedg. to Mr Pow.</note> one of your owne fellowes (as I heard) who when he heard that you were to preach on that parable, said that he marvelled that you would vndertake it being so vnfit: he would some more suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient man would vndertake it: with many such words tending to the like effect.</p>
                     <p>Thus have you shewed your self not alone ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; so acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged after a sort by some of your selves, but also are become an vpholder and pleader for darknes in others. But if your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling had ben alone of ignorance your fault had not ben so great, but you have added falsehood &amp; deceit therevnto, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb facs="tcp:20072:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. In that you were not ashamed openly in the pulpit (which you made the chaire of falsehood) to teach that <hi>exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had no ground from the 18. of Math.</hi> contrary to the coherence, drift, circumstances, consequence of that scripture,<note place="margin">Falsehood.</note> &amp; by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference also with other Scriptures: as shalbe shewed if you will vndertake the defence of your own doctrine. In that scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is shewed a power which Christ hath given to his Church, <hi>ver. 17.20.</hi> for the removing out of their communion, ver. <hi>17.</hi> such as remayne vnrepentant and obstinate in their sinnes, ver. <hi>16.17.</hi> and therefore excommunication. To what end should this doctrine tend, if not to bereave the Church of that power which Christ hath left for the sweeping of vncleannes out of the house of God. But this shall be further shewed, from whose breasts you suckt this poisoned milk, which now you give others to drinck: if you will not leave the doctrine to the wide world without defence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In that you trussed vp another false doctrine on the same Scripture, <hi>that the party offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der Mat. 18.17. should be an heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; publican only to the party first offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, not to the whole Church:</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the whol Church hath as much cause to be offended as the party that was first offended, yea &amp; more cause the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that party had at first to be offended, by reason of the continuance in his sinne, which the offender hath added to his former sinne. If you had vnderstood what had bene meant by (<hi>trespasse,</hi> verse <hi>15</hi>) you would not haue thus abused this Scripture: as may also be further shewed. In this point, one of your Ministers,<note place="margin">Mr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> but of greater wisdome &amp; discretion then your self hath signifyed his contrary iudgment to you thereon (as I have heard) as knowing I doubt not the falsehood and vanity
<pb facs="tcp:20072:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of your assertion thereon. Yea I dare vndertake that many of your our owne Ministers of best reformed iudgments, will be ashamed of these black drops which falls from your lipps.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In that you published in like sort that <hi>though open of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders did communicate with true Christians, yet were they not defiled thereby,</hi> traducing Mr Iohns: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And yet when you came to the triall of it in conference between you and my self, you said your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was of a true Christian in the sight of God, not of a true Christian in the sight of men, as he is a member of the visible Church, and that such a Christian could not sinne or be defiled with sinne in that he was regenerate or borne of God, which was never the question betweene vs, and so a true Christian did not sinn though he should commit Idolatry, Adultery, or the like, in that sence that you tooke sinning: Yea a true Christian might as much be defiled with sinne in communicating with open offenders, as by committing adultery, for any thing you have said in that conference, which is vnder your hand. This was your miserable shifting, I feare against the light of your conscience. Yet Mr Ies. a few dayes after, in a conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Mr Pow. and himself at Mr Bayl. on the same question took it in an other sense, yea in that sence, as which you said you meant not, neither could I bring you vnto it, as may appeare in that conference. Such confusion of languages doth well become the builders of Babell.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For that in your letter to <hi>Mr St.</hi> S.W.W.N. dated the 20. of Ian: 1603. you would vndertake, though no other would assist you, yet your self, by word, or writing, or howsoever, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whomsoever, to iustify <hi>your Ministerie, doctrine, &amp;c.</hi>

and yet by word in conferring you refused to iustify your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you were provoked therevnto: yea when I offred to prove it false in those particulars you mentioned, and to be separated from. I offred also to prove your doctrine false on the <hi>18. of Mat. and 13. of Mat.</hi> but you refused. I desired that I might propose one argument concerning the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween vs, but you would deale no further, except you might put downe some proof further of that which we never doubted of: viz: <hi>that a true Christian in the sight of God did not sinne in the regenerate part as he was borne of God.</hi> Was this timorous &amp; fearefull dealing answerable to your bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basted boastings, let others iudge. These be the doctrines of desolation which you do scatter: Let others now iudge what cause we haue to account you a false prophet, and they in mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable case that are led by such blind guides. Did you not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to wish in the pulpit <hi>that the Lord would stop your mouth if you spake not the truth.</hi> Your dealing hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed vs, and bene a meanes (through Gods goodnes) to gaine others to the trueth we professe, and for your self remember se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you care not what you teach, nor how you take the name of God in vaine, that which is written, Ion. 2.8. that <hi>they that wayt vpon lying vanities forsake their owne mercy.</hi>

We. told Mr Pow. that Mr Aw. was the procurer of the warrant. Thus do you by falsehood &amp; violence seek to vphold your ruinated kingdome, when truth &amp; verity hath forsaken her. And you shew your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in deed to be an Edomite, red with bloud, <hi>Ob. 1.10.</hi> like the scarlet coloured beast, who hath a mouth like a Dragon. <hi rend="sup">4</hi> Your associate Mr At. could tell me, <hi>that an other place was fitter for me,</hi> meaning the prison<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I answered, that if I had the gift of dissembling which he had, to subscribe against my conscience as he did (I told him then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; wher) I might live longe enough, &amp; inioy Achans wedge, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self doth without abridgement of liberty.

I pray you not to spend an houre and half in confuting vs in proving that we never denyed, as you did before, &amp; not to contradict your self as Mr Ies. did, disproving his owne doctrine the same tyme that he repeated it. The doctrine was that <hi>whosoever was reputed to be a Minister &amp; taught the doctrine in the foundation sound he was a true Minister,</hi> and yet in the same place at the same time he said that <hi>a non Resident was a thief and a robber.</hi> Now I hope he will confesse that a non resident is reputed by them to be a Minister and may teach the doctrine in the foundation sound, therefore a thief and a robber may be a true Pastor, (or els he disproved his own doctrine) which cannot be. With grief of heart I assure you I write these things, having bene sometimes perswaded that you had more conscience, and true knowledg of God then can be perceived in this dealing. Thus haue I given you a tast of your evill dealing, the Lord give you true remorse at the sight of your sinn, or els reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that which Mr Fox hath written of the terrible end of persecuters. If you haue any thing to say in answer, do not snatch here and there as your maner is, but directly and orderly iustify these doctrines which are laid to your charge as false. Thus as before, so still committing our cause to the iust iudge, I take my leave: this present the 25. of Mon. 2. 1603.</p>

heretofore, if he will regard no others, <hi>that a man who hath run away from his Maister, wil seldome give him a good report.</hi>

            <p>But thus is he the fitter servant for his Maisters the Prelates, by whose authority he pleaded here before the Magistrates that his book was printed: and vnder them belike hopeth to be sheltered in England, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath now betaken himself: for what cause he knoweth best. But wheresoever and howsoever he bestow himself, let him know, God will find him out: from whom he cannot fly, nor escape his judgement. For as Enoch the seventh from Adam prophecyed, so is it in all ages to be remembred, <hi>Behold, the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth with his thousands of Saints, to do iudgement against all men, &amp; to rebuke all the vngodly of them, of all the workes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For which cuase, we could for our owne parts so have left him, &amp; born in our bosome all his reproach, without giving any answer: had we not considered that by him not onely our selves but even the faith of Christ which we professe is traduced and oppugned; and many that are weak might thus be kept or turned away from the truth; and Salomon saith, <hi>He that is first in his owne cause,</hi>

               <hi>is iust, till his neighbour come and make inquiry of him.</hi> Therefore thought we it best at this time to make the answer ensuing. VVherein as now we have followed the counsell &amp; rule of wisdome, which saith,

               <hi>but that his heart may be discovered:</hi> whom God hath already made a spectacle to others of heady, contentious, and hostile opposition against the faith and witnesses of Iesus.</p>
            <p>Neither let him or any other of our enemies think their case the better, because of our sinnes or troubles or weak walking in the faith, whereo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they do so much insist.

Myne eyes shall looke vpon her, now shall she be troden downe as the myre in the streetes.</hi> And in this will we rest, and wayt vpon the Lord the God of our salvation: trusting in him, that notwithstanding our vnworthines and his chastising which we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, yet he will look vpon vs in mercy, and make all things worke for good vnto vs in Christ: And that
<pb facs="tcp:20072:9"/>
thus the vttermost opposition of all our enemies (howsoever they set them selves against vs, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our cause or against our persons, against our faith or our walking in it) shall turne to our good, &amp; to the furtherance of the truth witnessed by vs: which we have much found that adversaries of all sorts have a long time and many wayes oppugned, as they yet dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do and cease not: though all in vaine.

Yet, notwithstanding all the sinnes and vnworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of vs, let this still be held firme (at least till vve be soundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed) that our cause is the truth of the Gospell of Christ, witnessed against the errors of the defection of Antichrist.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The accusations made against vs, are to be considered with their proofs: which will afterward come to be seen.

            <p>The calumniation <hi>of condemning all other Churches and men,</hi> we haue often answered and cleared heretofore, &amp; this also knowen to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

               </gap>nd French Churches of this citie as with true Churches. Which had we not so esteemed of them, we neither could nor would so haue done and dealt with them, as we haue.</p>
            <p>THe <hi>letter</hi> he speaketh of, I haue still with me. His falsehood and other bad dealing therein, I will here omit, save onely about <hi>the doctrines</hi> by him layd vpon vs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first is <hi>that we held it lawfull for a man to live with her that is not his wife, rather then to reveale himself.</hi> This he saith: but how doth he proue it so to be held by vs? If malice had not possessed him, this error had never ben imputed to vs eyther as held by the Church or partaken in by the Elders. Sometimes in deed we haue had speach among vs of the vnlawfulnes (as we were perswaded) for man and wife to live together after adultery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted; &amp; about the band of wedlock being broken thereby; &amp; whether that in the case of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery vnknowen to others, the offenders were to reveale themselves,

or not. About which latter points when we shewed our judgment &amp; reasons, this <hi>Tho. White</hi> (who then was present) did much vrge, that a man who knew such a crime by himself must reveale it, or els live in sinne, &amp; with one that was not his lawfull wife. Wherevpon some of vs reasoned with him about it, holding that a man should not so reveale himself. The end was, that we differed in judgem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And concerning the question aforesaid, whereas some of vs were thus minded about it, that a man having co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted adultery (which is vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to others) is not bound by the word of God to reveale himself, but vnfeyned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repent thereof: and that in such case he may notwithstanding lawfully continue with his wife: Although I be not here in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to handle this point: yet I will now propound these few things to be considered about it. As namely, what Scriptures teach a man so to accuse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To come nearer to our owne times, it is well knowen that Mr. Calvine, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Beza, Fulk, Powell, Sutcliff, &amp;c. writing against the Papists Anabaptists and the like, haue in sundrie things erred, even concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the very pointes of the difference between them: Shall vve say therefore that they have betrayed the cause handled betvveen them and their aduersaries? and overthrovven the mayne drift of their ovvn vvritings? Not to speak of the Martyrs put to death by the Papists, how both many of them, and in many things, have erred, even concerning the causes controverted in their tymes.

Where before I answer him, let me advertise the Reader that if there be any weight in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, it was found out, not by Th.

               <p>Two things (as I said) about this description are specially noted and vrged: the first about <hi>the meaning</hi>; the other about <hi>my vvriting of the Israelites in Egypt.</hi> For the first, the meaning is plaine by the words themselues, and by the drift of that and all other of our boo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20072:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but by many other compared together, and particularly by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse declaration annexed vnto it in our Apologie against the Oxf: Doct. <hi>pag.</hi> 36.44.45. Yet now againe to explane and proue the truth of that description, I will here treat a litle more thereof.</p>
               <p>To esteem and describe aright a true visible Church, we must look especially to two things, 1. the calling of Christ; 2. the covenant and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the Church: To Christ his calling, like as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles every where describe the Churches according to it: As namely, the Churches of Ephesus, Corinth, Rome <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For which see these Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5.6.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2.9.24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.8.13. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.1. <hi>with</hi> 4.1.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.24. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.9.21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1.3. <hi>Iude, ver.</hi> 1. Now it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed but Christs <hi>calling</hi> of his Churches &amp; people, is vnto the whole faith of the Gospell &amp; willing obedience thereof, &amp; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And herevpon did the Apostles reproue the Churches still when they fell into any sinne eyther against the first or second Table, as not walking worthy the holy <hi>calling</hi> whervnto they were called in Christ; and required of them also obedience to all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements &amp; ordinances of Christ f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyme to tyme. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should <hi>White</hi> and his teachers have better observed that clause of the description aforesaid, <hi>by the vvord of God called out etc.</hi> So might they have perceived (if they had love to the truth) both that the description is good; and that the abberrations of true Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ches are so far from proving it any way false, as they do in deed approue the truth of it: in asmuch as the verie being of a Church <hi>by the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Christ</hi> requireth of them to walk otherwise.</p>
               <p>Another thing that we are to look vnto, yet also depending vpon the former, is the Churches covenant and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. This covenant is to be considered, as made by them vnto the Lord, and one with another, to walk together in the truth of the Gospell, in all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements and ordinances of the Lord: And therefore to forsake and avoid whatsoever is there against. As may appeare by these Scriptures, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.3—8. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.2.3. <hi>Esa.</hi> 2.2.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.1. <hi>and</hi> 44.5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.4.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.42.47. <hi>and</hi> 11.21.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.4.5.6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1.5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also, the description aforesaid is good. And so might the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries haue perceived, if they had well observed that other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20072:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
clause therein, of being <hi>gathered and ioyned together in fellowship of the Gospell &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what els is it that giveth the being to a true visible Church, but the calling of Christ, &amp; the Churches covenant according ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto? Wherevpon in a true Church may and ought these things following alway to be observed:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it hath Christ alone for the Mediatour, that is, for the Prophet, Priest, and King thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is to be accounted the spouse and body of Christ, the househould citie and kingdome of God, the ground and pillar o truth, a Church of Saints, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the promises and pledges of Gods covenant presence &amp; blessing do appertayne vnto them in that estate.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it apperteyneth to Christ, to remove his Candlestick &amp; take away his kingdome from a Church when and as he pleaseth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That every true visible Church hath authority and power fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ to receive in members willingly professing the same faith with them, &amp; to cast out obstinate offenders from among them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the want or transgression of Christs ordinances doth not simply or presently disanull them from being a true Church. For example, When a people are so called and covenanted as aforesaid, though yet they have none in office amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (eyther Pastors, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Elders etc.) they are notwithstanding a true visible Church. And by their calling and covenant they have power in Christ, as he giveth them fit men and meanes, to chuse and enjoy these, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his ordinances. Likewise also, when any of the Church yea or the whole do transgresse, eyther in some thing which yet they have not seen, or whereinto now they are fallen, they are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing a true visible Church. And by their <hi>calling and covenant</hi> they have power in Christ to redresse them. Which when vpon knowledg they shall refuse, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o continue, then are they to be esteemed according as their case shall require.</p>
               <p>So then, to judge rightly of a true Church, we must look (as the Apostles did) at their calling and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion in the Gospell. Which being observed, it wilbe easy to put difference between the errours, and the constitution of true Churches: as Christ and his Apostles did, in the Churches of <hi>Asia, Achaia, Galatia, &amp;c.</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for the one, and yet to approue them as true Churches for the other. And this also vntill Christ himself remove his can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20072:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and take away his kingdome from among them: which is to be left vnto him, to do when &amp; as it pleaseth him.</p>
               <p>And this also might serue for answer to the exception drawen from my writing, <hi>concerning the Israelites in Egypt</hi>: who sinned with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and yet were Gods people. But it being so vrged by divers as it is, I will note a few things more concerning it in particular. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is made thus, <hi>If they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted Idolatry vvith the Idols of Egypt, hovv were they then a company of faithfull people separated from all false vvayes?</hi> I answer, By the Lords former calling of them to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of himself, who was by covenant the Lord their God, and they his people. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 46. <hi>vvith Exod.</hi> 2.23.24.25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.7 8.15.16. <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.7. Which also is laid as the ground of the admonition, for calling of them from that Idolatry spoken of, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 20.7. And may not a people so separated as aforesaid, fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this sinne of Idolatry, aswell as into other sinnes? See the case of Israel afterward againe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. Where Moses in his prayer to God, calleth Israell <hi>the Lords people,</hi> even then when they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such Idolatry, as the Lord would presently have consumed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.1.10.11. And of Israell againe, see what is recorded, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And likewise of the Church of Rome, which at first was a true Church separated from all false wayes, yet fell into this sinne, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth therein. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.6.7.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.19. <hi>vvith Rev.</hi>

               <p>But this was <hi>the generall estate of the Israelites at that tyme.</hi> What then? So may it fall out with a true Church: as now hath ben shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and so we are taught, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.13.14. Yet here also might be demaunded, whether he meane it to be so generall, as including all of Israel therein, specially considering what is written of some in those tymes, <hi>Ex.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.20-27. <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. <hi>vvith Heb.</hi> 11.23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, whether this Idolatry were publike, or private, like as that spoken of, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8, 12. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.1.4.5.</p>
               <p>But howsoever, <hi>their sinne vvas also of obstinacy: for they vvere admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished from the Lord, &amp; yet they rebelled against him, as the Scripture shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Ezech.</hi> 20.7.8.

Or must we not alway desribe &amp; esteem a Church by the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof according to the revealed word of God: &amp; yet leave vnto the Lord to esteem &amp; deale therewith notwithstanding as in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect seemeth good vnto himself? Or when God saith, he is <hi>the Lord their God,</hi> and calleth them <hi>his sonne and first borne,</hi> whom he might in respect of their own estate cast of, can we not so esteem of them, but we must therevpon conclude, <hi>that in the description of a true visible Church, Idolatrie and all false wayes are not to be excluded?</hi> or (to speak of the questions controverted at this day) that Rome, in all her Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, is notwithstanding still to be reputed the spouse of Christ, and not to be rejected as an harlot? and so likewise all the Churches that be her daughters in that estate?

                     <hi>Tremell. and Iun. on Exod.</hi> 2.23</note> some think) that Israell first rebelling, and so provoking God to wrath, as is aforesaid, did afterward through the affliction which by Pharaoh was encreased vpon them, turne into their own hart, and crie vnto the Lord God of their fathers (as we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.7.)? should we not then put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>obstinacy</hi> still persisted in, &amp; that which is afterward repented of &amp; amended?

               <p>Wherefore to end this point, thus I think, that for Israel &amp; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people and Churches, we are bound alwayes so to esteem and walk, as by the word of God we have direction and vvarrant from him, and neyther to judge nor, vvalk othervvise: And as Christ giveth to all true Churches their being, so to leave vnto him to take it away when and as he pleaseth.

His reason therefore (if he would haue reasoned soundly and to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) should haue bene framed thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If no Church that hath bene since the Apostles dayes or now is that we read of, be in their account, by the word of God called out and separated from the world and the false wayes thereof, gathered and ioyned together in fellowship of the Gospell, by voluntarie profession of the faith and obedience of Christ, then by his description and in their account must they be no true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: But the former is true: Therefore the latter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The very propounding of the Reason thus, sheweth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20072:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the weaknes of it. 2. And what if we would not be drawen to speak of the Churches <hi>since,</hi> but onely of them that were in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles dayes: keeping onely to the word of God and that which is recorded therein? If they cannot by it or the example of those Churches disproue our testimony, what would it help them or hurt vs, if we answered them no further? 3. Yet to answer this Reason notwithstanding, and to omit the Proposition, as is aforesaid: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier proof of the Assumption, because all that he hath brought for confirmation of it, doth not yet proue it: as will appeare by discussing his allegations, concerning the Churches he speaketh of, 1. that were then; 2. that now are; 3. and our selues.</p>
               <p>For the first, viz, the Churches heretofore <hi>since the Apostles dayes,</hi> all that he saith is that we account <hi>the very saying of the Lords Prayer as a prayer to be a false way, which was vsed from the Apostles age &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Is this all he can alledge against vs concerning those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; tymes? Others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>s, that Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Primates, Metropolitans, Archdeacons, stinted formes of prayer, the vse of the signe of the crosse, and a number of such like things haue ben from the Apostles age. Should we therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them herein? And how cometh it that this Antiquarie hath never a word of all these for those tymes? Is it that he thinketh we hold them not now for false wayes of governing the Church and worshipping the Lord? Or is it not in deed because the Hypocrite would not yet be seen to speak for these, and would notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so diss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mble the matter, as yet may please all sorts that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. To speake of that he alledgeth, admitting all he saith here to be true, yet is not the Assumption thereby proued. For in all true Churches, the calling of Christ and the Churches covenant to obey the Gospell bindes them from all errour and false wayes: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that both the members and the whole body be subject to fall into them from tyme to tyme, while we live here on earth. If then this <hi>saying of the Lords prayer as a prayer</hi> be a false way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping God, it was excluded by their calling and fellowship in the Gospell: howsoever they fell into the vse of it. If it be not a false way, then were it but our errour so to think, which we were also to corrrect, &amp; the description notwithstanding still should stand good. Now what our judgement is concerning the right vse of that forme
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20072:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of prayer, together with our reasons out of the Scripture therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, we haue often shewed and published heretofore, in divers treatises, which till they be answered and refuted, I shall not need here to repeat them, or to insist any further vpon that matter. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus much now, If the vsing of the Lords prayer as a prayer, be a part of the worship of God appointed by Christ, then did the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the planting of the Primitive Churches teach them so to vse it: For they were inioyned by Christ to teach whatsoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them, and so they did: <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>with Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>and</hi> 4.24—31. <hi>and</hi> 20.27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. But that they taught to vse it thus, none can shew eyther in their Acts, or in their Epistles. And Tertullian saith, (if they regard his testimony) <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. de Monogam.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Scriptura negat quod non notat: The Scripture denyeth that which it noteth not.</hi> This man therefore and such as do so hold, <hi>that the Lords prayer is to be vsed as a prayer,</hi> are bound to shew by the Scriptures that the Apostles did teach the first Churches thus to vse it: vnles they would (with the Papists) argue the Scripture of imperfection, or the Apostles of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The distinction of <hi>faulty</hi> and <hi>false</hi> is here also to be observed. True Churches may be faulty in sundry things (as those of <hi>Asia, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth &amp;c.</hi> and yet not straightway therefore be false Churches. True Prophets may be faulty in divers things (as <hi>Ieremiah, Ionah, &amp;c.)</hi> and yet they be no false Prophets. True worshippers of God may be faulty in their worship many wayes (as may be seen in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Colosse, &amp;c.)</hi> and yet not therefore be false worshippers. By which examples also may appeare, both what difference is between <hi>false</hi> and <hi>faulty,</hi> and how needfull it is alwayes in these cases to be duly regarded.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His proof, <hi>that the Lords prayer was vsed as a Prayer from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles age,</hi> is out of Tertullian whose words be these:<note place="margin">

Because the Lord that seeth mans necessities did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part after the doctrine of prayer delivered say, Ask &amp; ye shall receive, and there be things to be asked according to the circumstance of every one, the lawfull and ordinary prayer being premised as a foundation, we may for the

Tertullian lived about 200 yeares after the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles dayes. 2. Many things were held lawfull &amp; ordinarily vsed in his tyme, which were not at all in the Apostles dayes: As, prayer with cloakes put off, and hands washed; signing with the crosse, and annoynting with oyle after Baptisme; Godfathers and Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; mixing of water with wine in the Lords supper; oblations for the dead; Lenten fast; holy water &amp;c. 3. He also followed &amp; was infected with divers errors, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> judgement, even in his owne tyme reproved and rejected: As, the Iewish errour of the Chiliastes, that the godly shall haue a pleasant life on earth, a thousand yeares before the end of the world: Also, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels fell for lust of women; That Noah, Abraham, and others of those tymes were righteous by the righteousnes of the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Whither also may be referred his errors about Freewill, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for sinnes, superstitious Fasts &amp; heresies of Montanus, &amp;c. Not to speak how from his exposition of the Lords Prayer (even in this book here alledged) the Papists would gather proof for their heresie of Transubstantiation, and the Lutherans of Consubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Againe, he disallowed sundry things, which were approued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by others according to the truth: As, the Baptisme of children, second mariages; fleing in tyme of persecution &amp;c. 4. But if they think there be such weight in Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s testimony, why do they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their preaching vse the Lords prayer after their owne prayers, when as Tertullian saith <hi>it vvas first premised as a foundation vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon petitions from out of it might be built</hi>? Which (admitting the vse of it, yet) sheweth a quite different vsing of it then, from that which now is had. And let it here be noted by the way, that Tertullian doth often in that book call it <hi>a forme &amp; doctrine of prayer,</hi> and sheweth that Christ hath not tyed vs to the vse of those words, but thereon to build our petitions as vpon a foundation, according to the need &amp; occasion of euery one, following his precepts. Why also do they not hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>that no continuance of times, or supportation of persons can preiudice the truth?</hi> If they wil belieue Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their book of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer, their Prelacy, Priesthood, crosse, surplice, and the like reteyned among them, may justly be charged with vanity, as being never appoynted by the Lord or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Neither can al their gloses perswade that ever they came from Christ, seing the Apostles did not deliver them to the nations, as appeareth by their writings. Nor is it material, whatsoever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of tymes they pretend, or supportation of persons they may have. None can preiudice the truth, as Tertullian sayth. And for the poynt in hand except they can shew that the Apostles did teach to vse the Lords prayer as a prayer, it is neither the continuance of tymes, nor the supportation of any persons, be they Old wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Churches, that can be admitted for a sufficient warrant, even by Tertullians owne testimonie.</p>
               <p>For <hi>the Churches that now are,</hi> we also refer it to our dealing with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> them. In our writings wee haue often signified our esteeming of them for true Churches: and in our walking towards them wee haue alwaies shewed it. And this more particularly, as we have had more special occasion, <hi>in our dealing with the Dutch &amp; French Churches</hi> of this City. When some of their members haue left them, because of their corruptions, and come to joyne themselues vnto vs, we haue required such first to deale with them, as with true Churches alway should be done, namely, to advertise the Elders first, and then the whole body of the Church whereof they were (if they might be suffered) of the corruptions, for which they thought to leaue them. Which we require not of such as come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs from any false Church. Also, when some of our Church have gone vnto them, and declined from the truth which they professed with vs, vnto their corruptions, we haue had dealing thereabout with the Elders both of the Dutch and French Churches of this towne, that were by the rest of their Elderships deputed therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, before we would proceed with the parties for this their revolt and transgression. And when the Dutch Church here received such to be members of them, as our Church excommunicated for their sinnes, we also admonished their Elders hereof, desiring that by themselves or by vs knowledg of these things might be given to the whole body of their Church. Which course of dealing we vse not with any false Church or the Ministers thereof. But to insert

here in particular the dealing that hath passed between vs &amp; them of this towne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Confess. with Mr Iun. letters pag.</hi> 54.</note> would be to long: &amp; their corruptions whereabout we have dealt with them, are already published. By which and this that hath here bene said, let the Reader judg, wheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r we haue not cause to put differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <hi>between them &amp; the other Churches of these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> not so dealt withal.</p>
               <p>For not hearing of them <hi>in other of their Congregations in these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,</hi> this I answer: That seeing by the mercy of God we haue seen and forsaken the corruptions yet remayning in the publick ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and condition of these Churches (if they be al like to them of this city) we therefore cannot partake with them in such case, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declining and apostasy from the truth which we haue our selues already received and professed. This also I speak of the members of our Church so walking and witnessing as is aforesaid, and not of the members of their owne Churches, whose duty I think it is, before they may leaue them for their corruptions, first to signify them vnto them, and by al good meanes to seek the redresse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of among them, as being members of the same body with them. Which I take also to be the duty of all such, as haue knowledge of their corruptions, and being not of them, yet would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with them in their publick administration. And this for true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But as for any false, these are not the duties or rules prescribed for them, but other of a far differing nature, namely, when once we see their abhominations, to separate from them without delay, and to witnesse against them even vnto death. The further decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof with confirmation from the Scriptures, the Reader may have in divers of our Treatises already published about our cause. As in the <hi>Refut of Mr. Giff. In the Answ. to Mr. A.H. pag.</hi> 61. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he provoketh me yet further, and saith, <hi>If he can, let him name any one Church on the face of the earth now, that holdeth not false waies, yea even in their constitution in their account.</hi> Although I might answer as before, that the calling of Christ and the Churches co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to walk in the faith of his Gospell excludeth al false wayes in all true Churches (whether as yet seen or vnseen) and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Reformed Churches so acknowledged by vs: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he presseth me so earnestly <hi>to name but any one Church, on the face of the earth,</hi> I wil giue the instance, of that Church in the west parts of England whereof himself was a joyned member, when he separated from the Church of England, and held the same faith
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20072:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with them and vs, from which he is now apostate. And let him now name any false way holden by them in their constitution in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>Of the distinction to be observed <hi>between faulty &amp; false worship,</hi> I haue spoken <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>pag</hi> 23.</note> here before. As also, of his blaspheming the Christians and their Churches, despising neighbours, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Christ himself of his honour. And now by that which hath ben said, let the Reader obserue how true it is in himself, that after al his earnest endevour not alone to wound but even to kill others (if he could) he hath turned the poynt of his weapon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne bowels. Which will also yet further appeare in that which followeth, in his particular objection against the Church whereof we are our selues, which he saith is not agreable to our description aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Against our selues, the proof he bringeth is this that he saith, <hi>vve are not separate from al open offenders, and all false vvayes:</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> to shew this, he produceth many particular <hi>persons and matters.</hi> I answer: admitting al he saith against vs both the generall and particulars were true, yet notwithstanding the description afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said should stand good, and our Church also agreable therevnto. For this yet should be the errour of our practise, not of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or calling in Christ: According to which we are alway to esteem or Churches, as we haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to come to the particulars, his first allegation is, that he saith <hi>we reteyne among vs open offenders</hi>: and for instance the first he nameth is <hi>one Cast. noted publikly in our meeting for cousonage &amp;c.</hi> A man that is of the Church of England, and so was a good while before this book of Whites was published. Sometyme in deed he lived among vs here, but after a while began to be so noted and dealt with, as fynding the Church to be no harbour for him (but that he must walk better, or be cast out from among vs) he returned to England, where he knew he might be reteyned in that Church, and where Th. White his fellow will (no doubt) brook him well ynough. But further he saith, <hi>the Elders here defended that he ought not to be publiklie dealt withall for it, because it was not orderly made publik.</hi> Indeed we hold, that private sins should privatly be dealt with, &amp; if any bring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20072:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in publick without private dealing going before (according to the rule given by Christ, <hi>Math,</hi> 18.15.16.) we suffer it not, but rebuke them that so walk. Wherevpon this White himself being by one of the brethren reproved for so dealing with the party aforesaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr R. Ia.</hi>
                  </note> it seemeth still to stick on his stomack: and the more, because after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vpon speach thereof my self with the rest of the Elders signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our dislike of such disorderly and evill walking. Touching <hi>his repentance,</hi> such as were then present do testify that he shewed it for such things as could be proved against him, &amp; in other things stood vpon his clearing. But whatsoever this White hath w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itten here against him, now that he is returned to the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himself also is revolted, the point of his weapon (if there be any sharpnes in it) is turned into his owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that Churches bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</p>
               <p>The same falleth out in his next instance about <hi>adultery.</hi> For that man also is declined to the Church of England, and there now liveth. Thus still is he snared in his owne wordes. But yet further see how he dealeth here in that which followeth. He saith, <hi>R.B. was publickly accused in our meeting, for creeping in at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to come to bed to another mans wife.</hi> That this is false, is testified by such as were present at the meeting spoken of, &amp; that he did not creep in at a window so to do, we heare is testifyed even by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from whom the speach of these things did first proceed.</p>
               <p>Which being so, why or how should wee <hi>deale vvith him publickly thereabout</hi>? And touching the man spoken of, it is well knowen that as he hath sinned, so he hath also repented: having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in before him the example of David in Israel. VVhere if VVhite had lived, as he hath done among vs, would it not have bene counted <hi>horrible</hi> (to vse his own word) so to have dealt with them, as he hath dealt with vs?</p>
               <p>His next instance is of one of our Elders, <hi>Mr St.</hi> against whom he objecteth in particular three things; The first, <hi>filthynes</hi>; and of this (to vtter his malice the more) he speaketh fower tymes in a few leaves together, sometymes vnder the termes of <hi>filthynes with his wives daughter,</hi> sometymes of <hi>vncleannes,</hi> sometymes of <hi>incest.</hi> For which <hi>Mr. St.</hi> hath called him before the Magistrates here, for a sclaunderer, desiring that proof may be brought, or satisfaction made according to justice.

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evils which he hath objected, are not <hi>in our constitution.</hi> And as not they, so neyther any other. For (as we haue said, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned often to repeat it) the calling of Christ and our covenant, which is to obey the faith of the Gospell, excludeth all evill &amp; false wayes whatsoever. Yet let vs consider the particulars which here he hath alledged</p>
               <p>The first is, that he saith <hi>we hold the Lords prayer is not to be vsed as a prayer, contrary to Christs expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, which is neyther against reason nor proportion of faith.</hi> I answer, if it be Christs commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so to vse it, then did the Apostles to whom it was given, both so vse it themselves, and teach others likewise to do. Neyther of which can be shewed. Then ought we alwayes whensoever we pray, to vse this for our prayer, seing Christs expresse commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, <hi>When ye pray, say, Our Father &amp;c.</hi> And so the Apostles and Christians in all ages haue sinned, when they prayed and said it not. Yea and these men themselues do aboue all other transgresse herein, who pray many tymes without vsing of it, and yet think it to be <hi>Christs expresse commaundement, which is neyther against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20072:24"/>
nor proportion of faith.</hi> Yet also when they shall haue consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that it conteyneth all things, whatsoever from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world to the end thereof haue bene or can be asked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right by any, it would be knowen with what reason or proportion of faith any particular person or Church can so vse it as they speak, without speciall explication and application of the severall heads to them selues and their present occasions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he saith our opinion is <hi>contrary to the tenour of the words, having the forme of a prayer in all things, as</hi> Our Father, give vs, <hi>and</hi> Amen <hi>annexed in the end, vvhich shevves that they are petitions not posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or rules vvhich are set dovvn in an other forme, Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.22. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Ansvv.</hi> If it be intended by the tenour of the words having the forme of a prayer, that it should be so vsed: then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the answers already made, I ask, VVhether we should vse it, as it is set downe by <hi>Mathevv,</hi> or by <hi>Luke.</hi> For <hi>Luke</hi> doth not onely vary from <hi>Mathevv</hi> in divers words, but also omitteth the whole Conclusion, yea and the word <hi>Amen,</hi> which is here alledged for a proof that it is so to be vsed as is aforesaid. But in deed other vse may be made (then these men do) of the propounding it thus by way of <hi>petitions</hi> rather then of <hi>positions or rules,</hi> as in other places is done: Namely, that Christ hereby would shew the right maner of praying vnto God, that we may with confidence come and speak vnto him in our prayers, propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding our requests holily, carefully, reverendly, without babling, according to our severall occasions &amp;c. And so meeteth with the manifold errours that in the vse of prayer haue crept into the world: as may be seen among <hi>the Papists, Neutral-Protestants, Anabaptists, Adamians, Euchetians,</hi> and other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks Idolaters superstitious and ignorant people: some thinking that we should not our selues come directly to God in prayer, but vse the mediation of some Saints or Angels &amp;c. others, that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on a book is prayer to God, though it be of other mens words prescribed vnto vs; others, that we should repeat the same things over againe and agayne; others, that we should vse sighs without words; others, that we should not pray vnto God at all, seing he knoweth what we need; and others, that we should ever be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, giving no place eyther to other exercises of religion, or to any labour of the hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which and the like heresies, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the heavenly and most comfortable vse of prayer, Christ hath prevented and condemned by this his direction for prayer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20072:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after the forme and maner aforesaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, he saith our opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is <hi>contrary to the vse of al Christians, that we read of, as before out of Tertullian and others may be alleadged. Answ.</hi> Then is it contrary to the vse of the Apostles and Primitive Churches of whom we read in the Scriptures. Which if any could shew, that alone would end the question: whereas the vse &amp; testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of any other persons Churches or ages cannot do it: As Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian himself sheweth when he saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Contra Marcion. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That is truest which is first, that is first which is from the beginning, that is from the beginning which is from the Apostles.</hi> But now admitting his proofs were good, that the Lords prayer (as it is called) were to be vsed as a prayer, yet were it then further needfull to be knowen, whether it be Christs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement that we should vse it for our prayer alone by it self, or that we should ioyne it with other prayers conceived by our selues withall. If he say, we should vse it alone, his owne testimony out of Tertullian (besides their own practise) is against him, who saith, <hi>that it being premised as a foundation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. de O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>other petitions may be built there vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And if he say, we should ioyne it with the other prayers conceived by our selues, the practise and testimony of the Apostles is against him. For which see, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.25. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.24.25. <hi>and</hi> 4.24—30. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.3.4.9.10.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.17.18.19.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second thing is, that he saith <hi>we hold it not lawfull for the innocent parties, to reteyne the offender, as the wife her husband, or the husband his wife, if eyther partie haue committed adultery, no though the innocent party vpon the others repentance, forgiving the others sinne, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous still to live vvith the other party in the mariage covenant as before, but haue excommunicated the parties innocent for so doing.</hi> This in deed we haue held (the most of vs) heretofore: and some of vs are <note n="‡" place="margin">
                     <hi>Yet res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with peace in their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of iudgment therabout.</hi>
                  </note>so perswaded still. And while we were generally so mynded, we also held it our duty accordingly to walk, taking the innocent partie that reteyned such offenders, though vpon their repentance, yet to be defiled and to liue in sinne with them, as <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.</note> coupling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with an harlot, But since vpon further consideration of this question, discussing it among our selves, when we could not fynde divorce in the Scriptures any where commaunded, but<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.</note>permitted onely; and that such offenders repenting thereof, are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in that case of harlots, but to be <note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.11.</note> washed from their sinne &amp; justifyed in Iesus Christ: we have vpon these and other like reasons altered our former judgement, and now haue thus observed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20072:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thus concerning this matter, That where the Magistrates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict not death vpon such offenders (as by the law of God they should) it is in the liberty and power of the innocent party, eyther for that crime to put away the offender, or vpon their repentance to reteyne them: But this with these cautions, 1. So as themselues were no meanes or cause of the others so transgressing. 2. That they be no nourishers of them in the like for tyme to come. 3. That this remission and acceptance of the offender by the innocent party be done before sufficient winesses. 4. That this also (as the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age at the first) be alway in the Lord. And for the Churches &amp; the Ministers dutie therein, that it is onely to teach and require of them repentance, after the example of Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.10.11. or els to see them cast out of the Church, according to the Apostles doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.12.13. This is that which now the most of vs do think concerning this question: being notwithstanding ready to heare, if any can shew vs better fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God, which is the ground and rule of the constitution of our Church.</p>
               <p>Touching the case and excommunication of <hi>H. C.</hi> and <hi>E. H.</hi> his wife (of which he speaketh both here and afterward againe) how will he prove the persons spoken of to be repentant, when as the one of them denyed the fact, which she had before confessed to two of the brethren; &amp; the other in the iudgment of the Church shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself vnrepentant many wayes, which I will not here mention. And if he do not shew them to haue repented, how hath he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that for which he alledged them? Besides that there were also other causes for which they were excommunicated.</p>
               <p>As for that which he saith, <hi>divers of vs have accused themselues of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery that so they might be ridde of their wives:</hi> this also he should have proved, and not onely haue said it. For we know that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whome he nameth (<hi>W. H.</hi> and <hi>T. C.)</hi> haue said and avouched earnestly, that they did it not to that end, but being perswaded that they ought not to continue with their wiues, having by their adulterie broken the bond of mariage between them. Besides, if by him or any it could be proved so to be as he saith, he knoweth we would not beare with such wickednes, but deale with them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their demerit: howsoever without all shame he do thus abuse vs.</p>
               <p>And here by the way let me a little note this mans crossing of himself, and bad dealing against vs still. Before in the beginning
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20072:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his book, he imputed vnto vs <hi>abounding with adulteries,</hi> and that <hi>above others,</hi> as if it were a sinne common and borne withall among vs, and this also more then among others. Yet here now his objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against vs, <hi>about the case of adultery,</hi> is such, as any may see he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth we haue ben too severe therein, and that aboue others. What this our opinion was, is shewed before. Wherein although we have chaunged our iudgment, as is aforesaid: yet even this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sheweth how greatly we haue alway detested that sinne, and how contrary this <hi>White</hi> is to himself, that he might by any meanes deale wretchedly against vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing is, that he saith <hi>we haue altered many things which we held in our constitution, as among other, that it was not lawfull for Apostates to beare office.</hi> He saith, <hi>many things,</hi> yet nameth but one. Towching which I might answer, that although many of vs did in deed so take it, yet it was not here so generally received by all as he seemeth to suppose, because that as there was divers times occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of question about it, there were of the brethren that shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be diversely mynded: but at length the matter being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and much vrged, we did thus agree about it, That we think it not meet to chuse such into office as haue before tyme declyned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth, without good caution first had thereabout: As namely, 1. That there be consideration had both of the nature of the thing done, &amp; of the quality of the person, &amp; of the estate of the Church. 2. That the Church have good and due tryall of such being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, afore they chuse them into office. 3. That with these cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the fittest be taken into office whom God giveth in the present estate of the Church. And all these things so mynded and observed of vs, as if at any time a better way be shewed out of the word of God, we be ready to receive it in the Lord. This is that whereof hitherto we have agreed about this matter: the particulars whereof there will be occasion to set downe more at large hereafter. But now admitting that the whole Church <hi>held it not lawfull for such to beare office, &amp; afterward altered it</hi> (as here he saith): yet was this alteration but of our judgement and practise, not of the Churches constitution, as I haue shewed before: and therefore his collection herevpon (that we held false wayes in our constitution, &amp; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, then were no true Churches) is both false &amp; frivolous.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth he propoundeth as a question, saying of vs, <hi>What would it profit them to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

their practise be not according to their profession</hi>? But the question and point here treated on is, whether the description aforesaid be true, or not; and whether we our selues be a true Church according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it? If we erre in practise, is it therefore a false description, or we a false Church? The Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> erred greatly in their practise, were they not therefore true Churches according to the said description?</p>
               <p>But yet <hi>where the practise is not according to the profession, it makes the sinne the more grievous.</hi> True, and therefore <hi>Tho: White</hi> his sinne is vnspeakably grievous, as all they do know who haue seen what great and earnest profession of the truth he hath made heretofore, from which now he is grievously fallen.</p>
               <p>But for our selues he asketh further, <hi>sith their knowledg is but in part aswell as their love, are not they aswell as others subiect to erre in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution aswell as practise</hi>? If he meane in judgment aswell as prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, we graunt it: and we haue alwayes professed it: howsoever he write against vs, as if we were such as professed perfection of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and practise in this life: from which errour himself knoweth vs to be as far, as we know him to be from trueth and godlynes. But if he meane <hi>by our constitution,</hi> the way of God wherein we are set, the calling of Christ with the Churches covenant, which giveth being vnto the Church, then I answer, that difference must be put between the way of God it self, and our weak walking therein; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the calling of Christ together with the covenant of the Church, &amp; our sinning and transgressing in our owne wayes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witstanding; between the Church considered in Christ the head thereof, in whom we are washed from all our sinnes, guyded in in the way of truth, and preserved to eternall life, and between the Church considered in the members thereof, as we are in our selves every one sinfull and subject daily to erre both in judgment and practise: And this not onely in the members severally, but in all of vs ioyntly together. If this distinction be not observed, who can shew that ever there was or can be true Church vpon the earth, or how we can haue true comfort in this life to our selves, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and discerne aright between things that differ, as we ought? And if it be observed, any may see that all his exceptions against vs are of no moment. It is not our knowledg or practise, but our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; covenant in Christ that secludeth in our constitution all false and evill wayes, whether as yet seen or not.</p>

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:20072:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>For which cause also I need not here stand vpon his needles and erroneous discourse about that which he calleth <hi>a shift,</hi> though in deed it be a point much to be respected, namely, <note n="‡" place="margin">

                  </note>
                  <hi>that a true Church must be separate from all false wayes, which they see.</hi> For as I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alreadie, we ought if we will consider aright of a Church, to look at their calling and covenant in Christ, which is from all false wayes whatsoever, seen or vnseen, to the obedience of faith. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever therefore we haue erred or may erre in judgment or practise (as we and all men in this life are alway subiect to do) yet doth it not therefore follow, eyther that the description aforesaid is not good, or that we are not a true Church notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>Further towching our selues, we acknowledge &amp; professe before all men, that divers things heretofore obserued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs at the first, we have since altered and do from tyme to time alter and amend, as God giveth vs by his word to discerne better therein: Yea and herevnto are we bound and haue power in Christ even by the constitution of our Church.

               <p>And now by that which hath bene said let the Reader obserue, whether this fellow haue not <hi>entrapped</hi> himself and his mother Church, while he thought to haue ensnared vs. Neyther let any be so simple, as to give <hi>credit</hi> in the cause of religion to any, further or otherwise but as warrant and confirmation is brought out of the word of God, which is the ground and rule of all trueth; nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse that which is approved by it, for the aberration, opposition, or calumniation of any whosoever they be.</p>
               <p>His abuse both here and other where in his book, <hi>of that which we haue published in print,</hi> I leave also to the Reader to observe, and for himself to answer to him that knoweth his heart. As for <hi>I. N.</hi>

whom he nameth in particular more then <hi>others</hi> whom he would insinuate, <hi>for borrowing and making no conscience to pay againe:</hi> he hath called him before the Magistrates here, as others before mentioned: affirming &amp; offring to shew how in the very particular alledged by <hi>White</hi> (when he was here demaunded his proof) for thus divulging him, he hath offred his creditour goods sufficient for his debt with overplus: and having had to deale with him for much, hath satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed all to a little, yet remayning: having also had hindrance by the sicknes and otherwise. And for the generall, we acknowledg that men ought to be carefull both how they borrow and how they pay againe, and should measure these, as all other affaires, with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conscience, according to godlynes. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.21. <hi>and</hi> 112.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. And we know also, that yet notwithstanding it is the case sometime of men fearing God, not onely to be but even to dy in debt: As we read of one of the sonnes of the Prophets; 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p>But all this which hitherto he hath said, being not ynough, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the vent of his owne rancour and malice against vs, or to please our adversaries whose favour he would purchase by tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of vs: he now further pretendeth to frame an opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>our practise,</hi> &amp; the Treatise entituled, <hi>A true description out of the vvord of God, of the visible Church:</hi> thus setting himself to seek and abuse against vs whatsoever he can out of any of our writings. To shew his wicked dealing herein as it is, would require to insist vpon the particulars of that description, and to compare therewith the estate and walking of our Church: &amp; that would aske a long treatise, which here I purpose not. It shall suffice, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, especially such as haue knowledg of our Church which he bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and of the Church of England to which he is returned, do compare them both with that description: and accordingly es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem of both as he shall fynd the estate of them to be in deed and in truth. Thereby also will plainely appeare, how this adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie neither writeth nor walketh in the feare of God: to whom notwithstanding he must giue account of al these things. And for the particulars he mentioneth, that the equitie of our cause and iniquitie of his dealing may better appeare, I will in the treating of them first set down the words of that description from whence he would draw his opposition, and then speak of the particulars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:20072:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>And first, for the body of the Church considered in her parts (as here he would seem to except against vs from one to another, through the severall parts of this body) thus it is set downe in that description of a true Church,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script. of a visible Church.</hi>
                  </note> Pag. 2. <hi>Suerly if this Church be considered in her parts, it shall appeare most beautifull, yea most wonderfull, and even ravishing the senses to conceive, much more to behold, what then to enioy so blessed a communion. For behold her King and Lord is the King of peace, and Lord himself of all glorie. She enioyeth most holy and heavenly lawes, most faithfull &amp; vigilant Pastours, most sincere &amp; pure Teachers, most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vpright Governours, most diligent and trustie Deacons, most loving and sober Relievers, and a most humble, meek, obedient, faithfull, &amp; loving people, every stone living elect and precious, every stone hath his beautie, his burden, and his order. All bound to edify one another, exhort, reproue, &amp; comfort one another lovingly as to their owne members, faithfully as in the eyes of God.</hi> Thus it standeth in that description. Towching which now I would aske, 1. Whether he hold this description herein to be true and agreable to the word of God. 2. Whether he dare deny Iesus Christ to be the King and Lord of our Church. 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he acknowledg him onely to be the King &amp; Lord of every true visible Church vpon the earth. 4. Whether these be the Offices and functions which he as Lord and King hath appointed to his Church, namely, <hi>Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons, Relievers.</hi> 5. Whether these be had in the Church of England to which he is now gone, and in whom they are there to be found. 6. Whether the Church Officers there be so qualified, as here is set downe. 7. Finally, whether if any would compare the estate of that Church, in the body, officers, members, lawes, and walking thereof, with the description of a true visible Church out of the word of God, he might not make another maner treatise and other maner of obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions against them, then this Priest of theirs doth against vs.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, for <hi>the Pastor</hi> (with which office he beginneth first) thus are his qualities and duties set down in that descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a true Church, <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. <hi>Their Pastour must be apt to teach, no yong Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

he must be modest, humble, meek, gentle, &amp; loving: he must be a man of great pacience, compassion, labour and diligence: he must alway be careful and watchfull over the flock whereof the Lord hath made him overseer, with all willingnes and chearfulnes, not holding his office in respect of persons, but doing his duty to every soule, as he will answer before the chief Shepheard, &amp;c.</hi> And afterward, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. <hi>The Pastours office is, to feed the sheep of Christ in green and wholsome pastures of his word, and lead them to the still waters, even to the pure fountaine and river of life. He must guide and keep those sheep by that heavenly sheephook and pastorall staffe of the vvord, thereby drawing them to him, thereby looking into their soules, even into their most secret thoughts: Thereby discerning their diseases, and thereby curing them: applying to every disease a fit and convenient medicine, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the qualitie and danger of the disease, give warning to the Church, that they may orderly proceed to excommunication. Further, he must by this his sheephook watch over and defend his flock from raven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now among these qualities and duties he excepteth onely about two: the one concerning <hi>pacience,</hi> the other <hi>love and compassion</hi>: Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so are such, as it is fitter for the Church &amp; people with whom I have lived, to speak therein then my self.

               <p n="1">1. Therefore towching the former, which is of <hi>impaciency,</hi> I will not stand to speak what I could, about the persons whom he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in particular, the dealing then vsed, the <hi>Discourse</hi> now written, the <hi>other witnesses</hi> vnmentioned, and the like: Neyther to alledg, how deserved reproof and severity is oftentimes accounted too much sharpnes and impaciencie; and that anger sometymes is both needfull and lawfull <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But omitting these things, I will for my self answer this, that I am a man subject to like passions as others be.

                  </gap>ing <hi>love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,</hi> why should I think otherwise but that I may sometimes fayl therein? Yet this man for it of all other might haue laid his hand on his mouth, to whom (when at fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

into these countreyes) I gave meat and drink and lodging about nine or ten weekes together, till he returned againe into England.</p>
               <p>Towching <hi>my Father</hi> (of whom he speaketh in particular) I do and will alway acknowledg that I was so bound to him both by nature and for his care and charge of my bringing vp, as I never did or could do ynough to shew my self sufficiently thankful. And what then should I do speaking of any thing I haue done by any meanes that way? And in particular for the tyme whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was here, what I did &amp; offered him to do, at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming hither, remayning here, and going from hence, with other particulars that might be noted, I will not here speak neyther, what my self could if it were anothers case, or what divers others know and could testify if it were needfull. Neither wil I stand to shew what I could tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the pretence which he maketh about his being here in <hi>necessity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of <hi>M. Sl.</hi> his abuse of me and maner of dealing at the time here intended, I will forbeare also to speak what he knoweth I might. If he at that tyme spake hereof (as here is affirmed) why might I not passe by it with silence, as I did at the same tyme a multitude of his raylings &amp; contumelies, as <hi>White</hi> himself &amp; the many witnesses then present did see and can testifie, if they will? When Shemei rayled on David, and Rabshakeh on Israel, David held his peace, and Hezekiahs people answered not a word. 2 <hi>Sam,</hi> 16.5—13. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.36.

               <p>But to leave these men, that which I will here speake fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this only, that it is needfull for all in all things carefully to observe and follow the rules prescribed by Christ,<note place="margin">

And it is noted in the description aforesaid, among the Pastors duties there mentioned, <hi>that he hold not his office in respect of persons, but do his duty to every soule, as he will answer before the chief Shepheard.</hi> In the performance whereof also the Pastor and other Elders and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20072:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Church are to be accounted and regarded as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But I will no further insist herevpon: neyther speak I these things to excuse my self in any thing I have done or omitted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then I should. I acknowledg my sinnes are many and my infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities great: and my strength and salvation is onely in the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: For whose sake I have (through his mercie) suffred much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, and I trust shall patiently beare it to the end.</p>
               <p>Next he cometh to speak of <hi>the Teacher,</hi> whose qualities and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are thus set downe in the description aforesaid, <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. <hi>Their Doctor or Teacher must be a man apt to teach, able to divide the word of God aright, and to deliver sound and wholsome doctrine from the same, still building vpon that sound groundwork, he must be mighty in the Scriptures, able to convince the gainsayers, and carefull to deliver his doctrine pure, sound and plaine, not with curiositie or affectation, but so that he may edifie the most simple, approving it to every mans conscience: he must be of life vnreproveable, one that can governe his owne houshold, he must be of maners sober, temperate, modest, gentle and loving, &amp;c.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. <hi>His speciall care must be to build vpon that only true ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, golde, silver, and pretious stones, that his work may endure the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the fyer, and by the light of the same fire, reveale the Tymber, Hay, &amp; Stubble of false Teachers: He must take diligent heed to keep the Church from errours. And further he must deliver his doctrine so plainly, simplie, &amp; purely, that the Church may increase with the increasing of God, and grow vp vnto him which is the head, Christ Iesus.</hi> Hitherto is that descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wherein the qualities and duties set downe, be many and great.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Yet cannot this Adversarie satisfy himself with them all as he would: and therefore coming to make exceptions against the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, he fetcheth his first, out of the generall description of the Church spoken of before, objecting <hi>that the Teacher is sleyned with hypocrisie</hi>: and to proue it he alledgeth <hi>his dealing concerning G. I. M. Sl.</hi> Yet sheweth it not so much as in any one particular: thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king belike that some are so simple in themselues or so set against vs, as they will take his word for proof sufficient, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth that dealing himself, &amp; in the things which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth can ly so notoriously, as if he had the art of lying and would be a teacher thereof vnto others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second thing he objecteth, is <hi>apostasie</hi>: because that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares since having received this cause he did sometimes yeeld
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20072:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to heare the Ministery of the Church of England. But synce that tyme hath so approved himself among vs, both in the witnesse of the trueth &amp; in the service of the Church, as hath ben for the great help and comfort of vs all, and my self in particular bound to testify concerning him, as Paul did of Marcus Barnabas sisters sonne, <hi>that that he hath ben my workfellow vnto the kingdome of God, which hath ben to my consolation. Col.</hi> 4.10.11. For the question it self and <hi>our account of Apostasie,</hi> I shall write more particularly hereafter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing is, that he saith <hi>he hath ben a meanes to bring in and defend false doctrines.</hi> But what be they? First, <hi>The latter of those two before mentioned.</hi> Now that latter was about <hi>apostasie</hi> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aforesaid. So as then himself accounteth them to be apostates, that having held our cause do afterward yeeld to heare the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Church of England; and that it is a false doctrine, <hi>that any such may afterward beare office in the Church.</hi> And what then is this <hi>Whites</hi> own case, who being a Minister of the Church of England, left both that Church and Ministery, and received our cause, and witnessed the trueth against them, and yet now hath yeelded not onely to heare but even to execute himself the Ministerie of that Church againe?</p>
               <p>But he will say, that among the <hi>Errata</hi> (at the end of his book) he noted this for one, that for the word <hi>(latter</hi>) we should here read, <hi>former.</hi> I have obserued it: and well in deed might he note it amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his <hi>Errata,</hi> who even while he would blame others of errour, doth so straungely erre himself as to put <hi>latter</hi> for <hi>former,</hi> one contrarie for another. But this might be an oversight (as often falleth out in printing) which therefore I would not haue noted, but that I think there is a worse thing in it: namely, that at first he both wrote and meant it of <hi>the latter,</hi> which is about <hi>apostasie,</hi> vntill he had himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate from the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ueth and executed agayne his Ministery received from the Prelates in England: and therevpon now would alter it, measuring the doctrines of religion, not by the word of God, but as may best serue his own turne. And I am perswaded the rather thus to think for these reasons: 1 because when he began to set himself to be an enemie of this Church and could not prevaile as he desired, he then began to make question about <hi>apostasie,</hi> whether any such might beare office in the Church: 2. If we vnderstand it here of <hi>the former,</hi> as his <hi>Errata</hi> now would haue it read, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose at all: seing there is in it no speach of any
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20072:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
points of doctrine, but of <hi>hypocrisie</hi>; and seing an hypocrite may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding teach true doctrine. For els it would follow, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iudas</hi> nor <hi>White</hi> himself did heretofore teach true doctrine when they preached, because Iudas was and he is an hypocrite, both of them through hypocrisie betraying Christ into the hands of his enemies.</p>
               <p>His other proof of <hi>false doctrines</hi> which he pretendeth is set down after his woonted manner, <hi>others that may be alledged</hi>: yet not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming any, which no doubt he would have done if he could, or if he durst adventure the triall of them with the Teacher of our Church whom he thus envieth and abuseth, who notwithstanding for his learning, wisdome, and godlynes, as also for his faithfull teaching of the Church and vpright walking toward all, is so well knowen &amp; approued, as neither he nor we need regard any adversaries ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice &amp; opposition against him.</p>
               <p>After this he commeth from the teaching to the ruling <hi>Elders,</hi> whose properties and duties are thus noted in the description a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid, <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. <hi>Their Elders must be of wisedome and iudgment, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Spirit of God, able to discerne between cause and cause, between plea and plea, and accordingly to prevent and redresse evils, alwayes vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant &amp; intending to see the statutes, ordinances, and lawes of God kept in the Church, and that not onely by the people in obedience, but to see the Officers do their duties. These men must be of life likewise vnreproveable, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their own families orderly, they must be also of maners sober, gentle, modest, loving, temperate, &amp;c.</hi> And afterward againe, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. <hi>Their especiall care must be, to see the ordinaunces of God truely taught &amp; practised, aswell by the Officers in doing their dutie vprightly, as to see that the people obey willingly and readily. It is their dutie to see the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holily and quietly ordered, and no way disturbed, by the contentio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They must be ready assistaunts to the Pastour and Teachers, helping to beare their burden, but not intruding into their office.</hi> Thus is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. Now towching our Elders, he taketh here his excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against two of them. The first is, <hi>Mr Da. St.</hi> against whom it may be he is the more eagerly caryed, because he discerned so quickly into him, being a notable white hypocrite, and dealt so plainly &amp; roundly with him as he did: And therefore also exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

and causes and to deale with them accordingly, nor for sundrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the properties and duties here required, though they be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and waighty. Yet some things he speaketh of, which he had twise before, besides that which he hath also hereafter: so as I need not repeat and speak of them, as he doth againe and againe. Yet somewhat more I will note here touching the particulars excepted out of the description.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is, <hi>of being indued with the Spirit of God</hi>: Of which we haue seen many and great testimonies in <hi>Mr St.</hi> from tyme to tyme. He hath bene an auncient disciple of Christ in the faith of the Gospell this many yeares; He hath given vp his life for the name of the Lord, being adjudged to death, &amp; so remayning many yeares vnder the sentence and dayly expectation thereof, till he was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; He now liveth still an exile for the same truth of Christ; And in the governement of the Church hath had to deale with so many causes, persons, and dispositions (yea oppositions also of sundry people) as if he had not bene indued with the spirit of God, &amp; that in great measure, he had never bene able so to have endured &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through them all, as he hath done. Which also may both stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himself still in the Lord, &amp; stop the mouth of all his adversaries. And for this Th. White himself, let it here be considered: 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be fit to beare any office at all, yea or to be so much as a member in the Church of God, if he be tried but by this one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, of being indued with the Spirit of God. 2 With what spirit he hath written this book of his. 3. Whether he haue not therein many times and sundry wayes blasphemed the holy spirit of God. For which he shall answer to the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second thing is, that he saith <hi>he would defend the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the lawes of God in himself and others.</hi> Note, that he saith not he hath done it, but that he <hi>would do it.</hi> And how shewes he this? Not so much as by pretence of any one particular for proof thereof, Yet this is the man that would perswade his Reader he could make <hi>due proof</hi> of any thing he layeth to our charge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing is, <hi>about the governing of his house</hi>: for which he referreth to that he hath <hi>els where cited,</hi> and so do I to that which is there said. Yet let himself take this withall, that if the things be true which are reported and observed concerning his own family, he might have found work ynough at home, and cause ynough to cast a beame out of his owne eye. But I will not follow his course
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20072:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in this maner (howsoever it might be iust) to deale with him as he doth with others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is, <hi>of crueltie and tyranny</hi>: for proof whereof he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeth <hi>that some of our owne members have complayned, that if they had a matter as cleare as the sunne against him, yet durst they not deale with him for it.</hi> But who be these <hi>some</hi> he speaketh of? why doth he not name them at all? Or would he haue vs to think that they be some such as hate the light, knowing that their works are evill, and whome he therfore concealeth: that he might shew himself with his fellowes <hi>Mr P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or why did he not obserue, that the Elders must be men of wisdome and judgement, able to discerne between cause and cause, plea &amp; plea, &amp; that it is their duty to repress <hi>the contentious &amp; disobedient, froward and obstinate?</hi> Which by whomsoever it be done, who can otherwise think but such will be as ready to open theyr mouthes against them, as they are to please themselves in their own eyes? But howsoever they may for a while lurk &amp; walk in the dark, yet God in his time will bring them to light &amp; discover them, as he hath done this <hi>White</hi> himself &amp; sundry other the like hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The other of the Elders he speaketh of, is <hi>Mr St. Mer.</hi> against whom he excepteth for <hi>Apostasie.</hi> The matter was thus. About thirteen yeares synce, a litle while after he was come to this cause which we professe, being in the countrey with his friends, he was there perswaded that he would heare some of the Ministers of the Church of England preach: Which he did once: And straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after being affected therewith, did it no more. Which also he made knowen himself, whereas otherwise it was vnknowen to vs. Now after that time living with the Church, and being wel approved among vs, he was about five yeares since chosen to be one of the Elders. Thus is the case: wherein now mark this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites dealing. The qualities and duties required in <hi>the Elders</hi> being so manie and great, as in the description are noted: was there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereat he could except, but this onely? And was his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice such, as rather then he would say nothing, he would except eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that which himself accounteth to be good and lawfull? Let such dealing then returne into his owne bosome, and be a comfort to such as be thus abused by him.</p>
               <p>From the Elders, he cometh to the <hi>Deacons,</hi> whose qualities &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

Bow.</hi> To whom about eleven yeares synce, the Magistrates of Narden did once (and not weekly, as this man intimateth) send a litle money to be given to the poore of the Church: which he together with one of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>(Mr. G.

Whereof because <hi>goodwife Colg.</hi> (the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of whom he speaketh) had not a part, therevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by her meanes it seemeth was this report raised of <hi>Mr. Bow.</hi> which now this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hath published: and for which with his <hi>many such like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> he is by <hi>Mr B.</hi> called before the Magistrates as a sclanderer. And touching the woman no marvel if shee so abused him, who hath synce in other things caryed her self so vngodlily, as she is cast out of the Church, and so remaineth. And for <hi>Mr. Bow</hi>: how wel he hath approved himself in his office, I shal not need to relate: neither need he regard any sclanderous tong or pen, knowing his owne integrity, and having the Churches testimony, to which he hath with good approbation ministred in that office now about fourteen yeares.</p>
               <p>After this dealing with sondry of our officers in particular, the adversarie commeth to speak <hi>of the Elders ioyntly.</hi> Against whom he obiecteth, <hi>that we called R.W.</hi> (that is <hi>Rose White</hi> his wife) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs in the first place, for a private thing.</hi> But it was, for that her child was kept vnbaptized; and for that we heard she had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned <hi>Ma.

doing, without her liking, and against her will (though not so signifyed vnto him) &amp; that her self gaue the excommunicate no countenaunce as approving his estate, we rested therein: instructing her onely how to cary her self in such cases for tyme to come, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting her to be carefull accordingly to walk as by the word of God we have rule and direction. Now for the hypocrite her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band himself, whereas he saith here, <hi>the Church of Christ do privately admonish a private sinne of a holy and loving affection:</hi> how will he shew this in the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, whither he is gone? or doth he hold it not to be the Church of Christ? or that it is by some priviledg not bound to the ordinances of Christ? Not to speak how himself by his owne mouth is condemned, whiles he acknowledgeth that Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ought thus to walk, &amp; yet publisheth he careth not what, things private or publick, true or false, and that with a wicked and malicious affection.</p>
               <p>Lastly, from the officers he cometh to <hi>the people</hi>: objecting against them <hi>vncleannes, cousoning, disgracing, backbiting, and vndermyning one of another amongst themselves.</hi> But this onely in generall termes: And so might any vnclean mouth, and backbiting sclanderer, traduce any people in the world.

                     </gap> wives daughter</hi>: and that she both confessed it vnto me her self, &amp; could not deny it here before the Magistrates, when she was by <hi>Mr St.</hi> now of late brought before them about it: as this man himself also is for a sclanderer, as I shewed before. For his <hi>not denying it for the clearing of himself, though he were requested for the satisfying of weak brethren so to do,</hi> he saith that he remembreth it not. But being thus dealt withal, he hath written this answer himself, which here I will annex out of his owne writing given vnto me hereabout. <hi>The malice and envie of this</hi> T. W. (<hi>against me</hi> Da. Stud.) <hi>hath appeared to be exceding great, both in his often speaking of me in his book as he hath done, and especially in this place, where making an end of mentioning my name, he thought he vvould powre forth his rancour to the full, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus he saith,</hi> Yet would not their Elder Da. Stud. never so much as deny the matter of incest with his wives daughter, for the clearing of himself, though hee were requested for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of weake bretheren so to do. <hi>In these words of his, he would make the vvorld beleive as if some came vnto me in frendly vvise to know vvhether I had committed</hi> incest <hi>or no, and as if they required my direct answere vnto it</hi> for the satisfijng of weak bretheren. <hi>To vvhich his vvords I answere: First thus: That there never came any so vnto me as he falsely forgeth, and therefore herein he lyeth egregiously. Secondly I aske vvhy he did not set downe vvhat my answere vvas to such as he insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth came vnto me. For if my answer vvere evil, no doubt he vvould not haue spared to sett it dovvn: if it vvere good, they vvould and ought to have rested in it. Further it is to be mynded, that he hath not named them that came vnto me, vvhich if he had done, himself saw that then his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes vvould the more appeare. Thirdly this I do affirm, That such as have spoken vnto me (about this slander and reproch raysed of me) in any christian and orderly manner, I have answered them to their full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and to such as disorderly and reprochfully have spoken to me thereof, I have, (mynding the persons as I esteemed them) eyther passed by them with silence, or else vrged them to do the vvorst they could vnto mee, being ready to answere them according to their dealing vvith me, as I have now endevoured to do vvith this</hi> T. W. <hi>&amp;</hi> Rose <hi>his vvife (the first author of this accusation) vvhom I have called before the Magistrates, for slandring
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20072:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of me. Fourthly being thus provoked by him, my answer now is, That if</hi> T.W. <hi>vvith his father if he vvere living (being reputed to have skill in the black art) had the help of him, and of all the divells in hell ioyned together, yet should he never be able to prove this his vvicked slander vpon me. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I vvould demaund these things of</hi> T.W. <hi>as followeth: First vvhether he vvill denye that his father spake thus of him,</hi> I misse my ayme if ever this my sonn T.W. do proue a good man. <hi>Secondly, vvhether he wil deny that he knowes not some that can tell of his evill dealing about Clokes. Thirdly vvhether he vvill deny that he hath not dealt yll vvith some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Bible. Fourthly: vvhether hee vvill deny that he hath committed the like sinne as</hi> T.C. <hi>hath, vvhom he mentioneth in his book. Lastly I ask him, vvhether if he do not presently deny these things, or any the like, that by any shalbe demaunded of him, he be content to have it taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that then he is gilty of them. If this be his iudgment, let him take it to himself, as vvise as he vvill be othervvise mynded. And thus I leave him &amp; this his dealing and account thereof, to him that iudgeth righteously, and so end vvith this saying,</hi> An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour, but the righteous shalbe delivered by knowledg,<note place="margin">

But yet more, in that he saith <hi>my self with the rest could offer to receive Mr Deux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries child to baptisme, who neither was neyther would ioyne himself a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vnto vs.</hi> For <hi>Mr Deuxb.</hi> (who dwelt about fifteen miles from vs) being desirous that we would baptize his child, we wrote vnto him that we could not admit of it,<note place="margin">

Which things being so, how then should it be as he saith further, <hi>that we were offended at G: I. for withstanding it,</hi> when we our selves so wrote and dealt in it, as is aforesaid.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church cannot certainly be knowen; nor any publick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be rightly performed. Which reasons we signifyed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in our dealing with them heretofore. On the other side, we misliked also that a few people, being straungers together in one towne, of one language, of one profession in religion, &amp; having not before tyme their peculiar officers, should in such case yet divide themselues <hi>into severall Churches</hi>: For which I required example or warrant out of the Scriptures, and alledged my self divers reasons about this question. And what contrariety now is there in these things, being laid together as they ought, with their true and due circumstances? Such perhaps as the false teachers would pretend against Paul, when he circumcised Timothee, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.1.3. and yet would not circumcise Titus, but withstood the false brethren that vrged it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3.4.5.</p>
               <p>The <hi>others</hi> he speaketh of, were himself and some other with him, who had left the Church of England, and came to dwell here.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, and those also specially out of their own letters, which being as their owne children shall also be their Iudges.

way as we do; reputing and calling themselves a Church, distinct from vs, and in their letters to the Church of the West countrey thus inscribed them, <hi>The Church in Amst. to our bretheren the Church in the West, partakers of the same heavenly vocation, &amp;c.</hi> And in the letter wrote thus, <hi>For our consultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; resolution thus it is, To meet apart by our selves, aswell for the redresse of disorders that may arise, as also for the administration of the word, expecting the blessing of God which hath not chosen vs for our multitude, seeing we were the fewest of all others.</hi> And againe in the same letter, <hi>for our own estate, though our hope to be a body distinct in our countrey vvere, yet is not our hope to be a distinct body in a straung countrey frustrated, but rather accomplished.</hi> And afterward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine speaking of vs, and themselues, they say, <hi>For the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches estate, though that acknowledgment of them vvere graunted, yet all things considered, vvhether God doth not offer vs occasion to increase the number of the Churches, and our selves to vvalk together in holynes to the Lord, vvho have had better experience one of another then of that Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches estate, that by this meanes the adversaries reproches, of one Church, and flocking therevnto, setting vp one head, may be stopped, is the thing vve pray you to ponder.</hi> Thus they wrote in a generall letter together.</p>
               <p>And in another of theirs written in particular by this <hi>T. White &amp; Tho. Pow.

Thus wrote they then of themselves. By which may appear, both what they intended, and for what. They intended to be a severall Church from vs, though they were but a few, and of the same faith, living straungers together, in the same towne, &amp;c. And the cause why they did it, <hi>That they might redresse disorders among themselves</hi>; that they might be <hi>a distinct body in a straung countrey,</hi> as they purposed in our native <hi>countrey,</hi> before they came over hither; that they might encrease <hi>the number of Churches</hi>; that they might stop the adversaries reproches, <hi>of one Church, and

flocking therevnto, setting vp one head</hi>; that they might <hi>receive such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </p>
               <p>If these things were so as then they wrote, how saith he now in his book, that the cause why they would not ioyne to vs, was <hi>for disorders amongst vs</hi>? How do his letters and his Libell agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Specially seing in the same letters, at the same tyme, they write vs to be <hi>their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church in Amsterdam; of whose estate they had not that experience &amp;c.</hi> Belike he had forgotten the old saying, <hi>Mendacem oportet esse memorem, A lyer had need have a good memorie.</hi> And further, if it were as he saith now, why did they not then so alledg, that we might haue insisted therevpon? why shrank they from the handling of the question between vs, which we would have discussed by the Scriptures, had not they refused as they did? But (if some be not mistaken) there was an other cause then any of the aforesaid, which they will not make knowen, namely, that <hi>Mr Po.</hi> &amp; this <hi>White</hi> might have bene Officers of that Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had little hope among vs to satisfie their desier: Which whether it were so or not, themselves know best. And howsoever, yet with what face can this hypocrite write as he doth, that they would not joyn to vs <hi>for divers disorders among vs,</hi> when but even a while after, they returned to the Church of England, which they knew certainly to have not onely divers disorders, but even a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the corruptions of Antichrist the sonne of perdition.</p>
               <p>Well might he write of these things, as he did in another letter of his to <hi>Mr S. W. Respice finem, Look to the end.</hi> For as they sowed, so have they reaped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not having the wind of Gods grace to blow vpon them that they might be a fruitfull garden, but the worme of Gods judgment to smite them that they might become a withered gourd. And this according to his owne prophecy (though as <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> speaking more trueth then himself intended) when to the same <hi>Mr S. W.</hi> he wrote thus also, <hi>Certainly if God doth not worke mightily for vs we shall come to desolation.</hi> Balaam even then when he would have cursed Israel, prophecied the truth, though against his will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fift is a meer calumniation, like the rest. In the place quoted, we blame in the Dutch (as we do also in the French) Church of this towne, <hi>that the rule and commaundement of Christ, Mat.</hi> 18.15.16.17. <hi>they neyther observe, nor suffer rightly to be observed among them.</hi> (If this man-pleaser could approue them herein, why doth he not?)
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20072:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For our selves we do carefully observe it, &amp; think all the Churches of Christ are bound so to do. For <hi>deciding of matters</hi> which are of publick nature, they are made knowen and decided among vs in &amp; by the whole body of the Church, and not <hi>by the Elders alone.</hi> Yet therein we have this order, that all such matters be first signifyed <hi>to the Elders,</hi> to whom the oversight of the Church and affaires thereof apperteyneth: by whom likewise they are proprounded advised &amp; treated of also publickly, as the cases do require. Of which points we have spoken sufficient (at least till we be answered) in our <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie against the Oxf. Doct. pag.</hi> 63.64. Notwithstanding if any come to the Elders, eyther for our advise or to have some matters brought to the Church, we shew them what we think to be best as we are perswaded our selves: &amp; yet debar not any from proceeding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so as they will answer their doing to the Church, as there the case shalbe found to be. And this to be our practise and maner of walking, I think this man himself knoweth well.</p>
               <p>For <hi>T. C.</hi> his matter, the Elders did not <hi>decide it</hi> (as he falsely saith) but shewed him what we our selves thought to be best accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to godlynes, and required of him to do no otherwise in it, then he could answer to God and to the Church. Of the matter it self, as also of <hi>W. H.</hi> is spoken here before, <hi>pag.</hi> 33. And for that he saith here, seeing <hi>W.H.</hi> his wife put him away, who can constreine her or any other in like case to retein such if themselves be not willing.</p>
               <p>For the bringing of matters in <hi>a third place to the Elders,</hi> as they have obiected: <hi>Mr P.</hi> himself &amp; the rest of them have ben answered, that we do not so: but that when in the third place a matter is to come vnto the Church by that rule of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. this is the order we keep therein, that first knowledg thereof be given to the Elders, the overseers of the Church, then that they seing the matter to be such and so dealt in as is to come to the Church, it be by them pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly propounded and prosequuted as is meet: whereas otherwise both the Church might be troubled and mens names and private matters be brought in publick without iust cause. And this we do, not adding <hi>to that rule of Christ</hi> (as this man and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers have still objected) but having that care and keeping that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the observation thereof, as the Scriptures els where lead vs vnto. For which, see 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.18.19.21.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7.8.1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.12.13.14.27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1.7.8.11.12.18.29 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.1.6.7.13.14.22. <hi>with Exod.</hi> 3.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.29.30.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.21. <hi>and with</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40.</p>

When he stayed there, vpon other occasion, he saith it was not so long as here is deceitfully pretended, (though longer then he or we would have had it) and that he could not then possibly do otherwise, as things fell out. But I will not here insist to speake, what may be done in cases of necessitie or speciall occasion; or to put dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between factours, servants, and men agreing together on mutuall conditions; nor vpon the difference that is between Ministers of the word and the Deacons; and specially the difference between one man having two three or fower benefices (as they call them) by reason whereof, though he be still with some of those Churches, yet must he needs be a non resident all his life, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one Church having two three or mo Deacons, by meanes whereof though some be absent vpon occasion, yet there are other vsually present to performe the duties apperteyning to the office notwithstanding.

The first particular here spoken of is about this, that we blamed in the Dutch Church of this towne, <hi>that they receive vnrepentant excommunicants, to be members of their Church: which by this meanes becommeth one body with such as be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered vnto Sathan.</hi> But this man had no list to set it downe in our owne words, because he hath no love to speak of things as the truth is. And if there were no other corruption but this onely in the Church aforesaid, let such as are of judgment consider whether we have not just cause to put difference between it, &amp; the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20072:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of these countreyes that stand not in like transgression: (of which we spake before, pag. 25.) and whether we which know these things and have had dealing with them thereabout, may suffer the members of our Church to joyne with them in this estate, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of their worship and Ministration, be it the preaching of the word, or any other whatsoever. Yet notwithstanding it is false that he saith <hi>we excommunicated our owne members onely for hearing the word preached amongst the Dutch or French:</hi> for those whome yet we haue cast out hereabout, it hath bene partly for their revolting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trueth which they have professed with vs, to the corruptions of these Churches (which declining as they may shew in hearing the word preached among them in such estate,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18.</note> so are we accordingly to esteem thereof) and partly for other sinnes withall, whereinto they have fallen. And a most shamelesly it is, that he saith <hi>we are our selves one body with an excommunicate from the French Church.</hi> The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whom he intendeth (now one of the Elders of our Church) was not excommunicated by them, but did himself leave them for their corruptions, after he had long &amp; much dealt with them in all good manner to the vttermost of his power thereabout, &amp; they persisted therein notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>The next particular here spoken of, is about our dislike of them for that <hi>they observe daies and times, consecrating certaine dayes in the yeare to the Nativitie, Resurrection, Ascension of Christ &amp;c.</hi> Which this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie himself knoweth we do not: though his conscience be so seared as he careth not how he bely vs and abuse the Reader, so he may seem to say something against vs. And straunge it is (if he were not impudent out of measure) that he is not ashamed to say <hi>that we observe their holy dayes as much as they do.</hi> A thing which is false, in both the instances which himself giveth hereabout: the one being about <hi>the shutting of shops,</hi> the other about <hi>our publick meetings for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, on those dayes.</hi> For towching the first, such of vs as shut their shops, do it not in respect of religion or with observance of publick worship as they do, but partly thinking it to be a thing civill which may be done at the Magistrats appointment, seing no spirituall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation is vrged vpon vs withall, partly chusing rather so to do then to pay the penalty whereto otherwise they are lyable, it being far more then in compasse of the day they could by their labour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn.

That we have the power and vse of excommunication: without which no Church can walk aright in obedience of the faith of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor long continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manifold errors and corruptions prevayling among them. 2. That even by this appeareth we hold that evill men may creep into and arise in the Church. 3. And that when they are once knowen and will not be reclaymed from their evill, we approue them not, but cast them out from among vs. And so this fourth poynt being well observed, overthroweth the whole tenour and intendement of all his writing against vs. Now to come to the particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. About thirteen yeares synce, this Church through persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in England, was driven to come into these countreyes. A while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were come hither, divers of them fell into the heresies of the Anabaptists (which are too common in these countreys) and so persisting were excommunicated by the rest.

As for him in particular of whom he speaketh that he <hi>was distracted in mynd,</hi> 1. He was not then so knowen to be, neyther so reputed of his fellowes, but onely that he had some trouble of conscience which disquieted him. 2. Yet sithens it hath bene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by some that he was dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this he would never yet do: although it have bene signifyed to him againe and agayne by my self and others, that thus the Church had agreed concerning him. And thus standeth his case.</p>

Wherevpon the matter being againe and further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined both by them &amp; by vs (as in such estate and distance of place we could do) it was in the end agreed vpon by the Church, that the excommunication was iust and not to be recalled, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the errors in the maner of proceeding thereabout: which the Church then did and alway is ready to acknowledg, and wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had before revoked it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>And now both for their good whom this matter more specially concerneth, as also for the satisfying of others, and that <hi>Th. White</hi> his abusing of vs may better appeare, I will here briefly note downe the grounds whervpon the excommunication was esteemed iust &amp; not to be recalled: as I find in some writings reserved about this matter: Which was thus. 1. The excommunicated were found to be abettours of an evill cause, and therevpon to have made the schisme at the first: and so were guilty of the sinne for which they were proceeded against. And this was then agreed on all hands, as we were let to vnderstand. 2. They also were afterward divers tymes and wayes reproved &amp; admonished thereof; They had sight of the witnesses testimonies about the matter then in question; they heard the reasons gathered by one of the brethren for their convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Church sent vnto them of the best able of the brethren to deale with them, besides that we wrote from London concerning this matter, exhorting them to peace &amp;c. And all this before the last message of the Church vnto them, which was <hi>that they should

                     </gap>me to the Church, &amp; there they should be convicted, or if they came not they should be cast out.</hi> 3. They yet remayned impenitent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised the Churches voyce and authority. Which appeared by their answer to the Churches message aforesaid, being to this effect, <hi>That as by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or as vnto the Church they would not come at any time</hi>: And, <hi>that whereas some of them were to go out of the towne on the morrow, and all of them were at that time vnprovided to maynteyne their cause, if they might have a hand with them in appointing another day, they would come to conferre with them and mainteyne that they did.</hi> In which answer be divers things shewing their impenitency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising the Churches authority. 1. Their answering resolutely, <hi>that by comaundement or as vnto the Church they would not come at any time.</hi> 2. That they would <hi>have an hand in appointing the day when they would come.</hi> Which might have greatly infringed the libertie &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church, to yeeld vnto schismaticks an equall authority in such cases. 3. That their comming should be <hi>to conferre and mainteyne their cause,</hi> not to shew repentance. Besides that some of them also dispitefully asked the brethren, <hi>when they would draw out their woodden dagger, &amp;c.</hi> Now whereas it hath bene objected, <hi>that they refused not simply to come, that charity would have taken things in the best part, that the Church might have appointed them another day &amp;c.</hi> it was also graunted that these and all such things should have bene duly weighed afore the censure had bene executed, and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever errour was committed therin is alway to be acknowledged: yet for the reasons before alledged, the censure was deemed to be just and not to be recalled.</p>
               <p>And for those he speaketh of <hi>that withstood their receiving in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,</hi> even this sheweth that there were then among themselves which thought the excommunication was not to be revoked. Yet were not they <hi>therefore excommunicated,</hi> as he saith: but were earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhorted to rest in their difference of judgement, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it peaceably to continew with the Church, if it were but till they could vse the advise and help of others for the better clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this conttroversy which had so long &amp; much troubled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet they would not, but left of all communion with the Church: and so persisting, were for this cause excommunicated: Who also afterward vpon acknowledgement of their e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Of the third, which is about the question of <hi>Apostasie,</hi> (often spoken of by him who is so notable an Apostate himself) I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken somewhat before, <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. Now further the Reader is to know, that while my self with some other of vs were prisoners in England, there fell out question about this matter among the brethren here in these countreyes. Whereof knowledge being given vnto vs from hence, we wrote <hi>a letter</hi> vnto them, setting downe what our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then was about this point, &amp; <hi>the reasons</hi> perswading vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. And this is that wherof he speaketh here: which we wrote to the Church being absent from it. Whereabout some of the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from hence wrote vnto vs a while after, how they were contrarie mynded, and their reasons thereof. Afterward it pleased God so to dispose as we were discharged out of prison, and came over hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Being here, there was speach and question againe about this matter: And some of vs did now consider further about it, more being observed out of the Scriptures about this point, then at the first had ben. And so began <hi>the alteration of our iudgment</hi> to be such as it is. Which was a good while before ever we heard any thing concerning <hi>Mr A.</hi> So very false it is which here he writeth therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
               <p>And for those <hi>that were cast out,</hi> these things are to be observed: 1. Both the poynt in generall, and the case in particular was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. For the generall, these questions were spoken of,<note place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>And these were in deed the causes that made vs think more and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of this matter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we had done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Which we also shewed in the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> whether <hi>the Priests</hi> being speciall types of Christ, the exception out of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44. where they are spoken of, do yet include all persons, tymes, offices, and conditions, &amp;c. Also, whether even in the tyme of the Law, <hi>the Levites</hi> (which were not of the Priests) falling to Idolatry, and afterward repenting, might not againe have and execute the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20072:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
same office &amp; function as they had before: And in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether <hi>Iohn Mark</hi> at first refused by Paul for his apostasie, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.37.38. was not afterward received by the same Apostle and employed in the Ministerie of the Gospell notwithstanding, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.10.11. &amp;c. For the particular, it was also considered, what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was about (which is spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of before, <hi>Pag.</hi> 42.) that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves could not deny but he was a man very fit for the office in all other respects; that he was already in office, and the thing before this tyme not knowen to the Church concerning him; (although if it had bene knowen, consideration were to be had of the nature of the thing done, of the condition of the person, of the estate of the Church, and other the like circumstances to be observed thereabout) that both before and after his being in office he had well approved himself to and with the Church, to the great help &amp; comfort of vs all, &amp;c. 2. Yet notwithstanding they persisted and left of to participate with the Church in all his ministration therin. 3. We entreated them that they would not so walk, but to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new with vs as before, at least till we might eyther among our selves or by others have further help and dealing about this matter: but they would not. Wherevpon they were for this leaving of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, together with other causes which he noteth not, cast out: and some of them a good while synce vpon their repentance received in againe.</p>
               <p>For that which he saith of <hi>not answering the reasons in writing,</hi> note these things: 1. We were absent from the Church, when we wrote the reasons aforesaid in a letter sent hither: but now were here present with the Church to speak mouth to mouth with any that did or should make question thereabout. 2. We also signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if it were so that we were absent, having like occasion as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we would then write as before we had done: but being now present to speak and reason together, we thought it best so to do. Not to speak any thing now of the persons and their dealing that would have it otherwise. 3. Yet when the matter was still vrged, we further advised &amp; agreed about it, of some particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances or cautions to be observed therin: Which were set down in writing, and given to the ruling Elders, for any that would come to read or reason thereabout: And vpon occasion we gave the same also in writing to the Eldership of the Dutch Church here. These things <hi>T. White</hi> himself knoweth, and heretofore thought it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to satisfy any that were reasonable: howsoever now he write
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20072:43"/>
thereof.</p>
               <p>And where he saith <hi>we would not suffer the reasons to be read in our. meeting, being requested there vnto</hi>: sometimes in deed we did not suffer it, wishing the parties that were contrary minded vnto vs to shew their reasons out of the word of God (whether they were those conteyned in that writing or any other) and so to reason from that ground, which is the onely rule of our faith: sometimes also for the more satisfying of all, they were both read and reasoned of in our publik meeting.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>playing Sathans part,</hi> let him apply it to himself, who hath heretofore both by word and writing out of the Scriptures appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our cause against the Antichristian estate of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and having now left and oppugning it, yet hath not, (nor ever can) vse as good meanes to disprove it, and to approve the estate of that Church whither he is returned: With whom also it is so common throughout his book, to obiect against vs things very false, &amp; to conceale or deprave the things he knoweth to be good: and all this to calumniate the truth and vs that wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nesse it before the world.</p>
               <p>For that which he annexeth of <hi>Mr Ad.</hi> such as were here present, do neyther remember it, nor think it to be true: howsoever he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it: And if it had so bene, yet who knoweth not that altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of practise doth vsually follow alteration of judgement? And if in other cases, why not in this also?</p>
               <p>Finally we do here know but in part: &amp; are subiect to erre both in our judgment and in our walking: as I deny not but in these things thus much vrged vpon vs we may have done. Yet our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire hath bene and I trust shalbe alway to try all things by the word of God, and to keep that which is good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth instance is of <hi>W.A. cast out for recalling a former Schisme,</hi> spoken of a little before in his first instance. Whatsoever <hi>W.A.</hi> now say, the Church heard and see what then he spake &amp; did. If he do still repent of that Schisme, <hi>standing to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he made,</hi> that matter is soone ended. To <hi>the writing of Th. White and others</hi> about this matter, this answer was given by the Elders (which the messengers can testify) that it being about excomunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was a matter which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerned the whole body of the Church, and therefore if they had any thing to say thereabout, they should come to the Church at our publick meeting, and there they should
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20072:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have an answer. But thither came they not. So themselves kept back an answer from themselves. And still <hi>Th. VVhite</hi> keepeth on his course to write falselie. What the <hi>schisme</hi> here spoken of was &amp; whereabout, see before, <hi>pag.</hi> 65.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>appealing,</hi> seing it is from an inferior Iudge to a superiour, we hold it Antichristian to enterteyne or admit of such appeales from one Church to another, because Christ the Lord hath given like &amp; equall power &amp; authority to all his Churches on the earth. Yet notwithstanding may and ought one Church to help another, by any good meanes they can, as there is occasion. But what is this to the appealing and tryall whereof he speaketh, when such as be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated by this Church, would have their matters and the like submitted to the Dutch and French Churches here, or any other els where? For which themselves could not by the word of God shew any warrant: And against which we had &amp; have these reasons following. 1. That the Iudge which God hath ordeyned in these cases, is to be submitted vnto, and not to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8.9.10.11.12. 2. That the highest Iudge ordeyned now of the Lord for all sinners by Ecclesiasticall censure, is the Church, even that particular Church whereof the sinner is a member, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. <hi>with</hi> 1 Cor. 5.4.5.12.13. 3. That all Churches of Christ haue equall power, and are not one over an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but have Christ himself over all, and in middest of all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.1. And therefore in vrging our Church to submit to another Church, they sought to draw it into Antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bondage, which we might by no meanes yeeld vnto, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9.12. 4. The sinne and sinner being bound in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how may the cause be submitted to men on earth? <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. 5. If the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church, then also other doctrines of the Gospell &amp; our faith in Christ, might aswell by the same ground be brought to like submission. 6. It is contrary also to the Confession of our faith published, <hi>Artic.</hi> 24.25. 7. And this way there would be no end of strife: for if the two Churches disagreed, a third &amp; higher must be sought vnto by like reason; and if yet they agreed not, an higher then that: and thus might the vsurped Supremacy of the Romish Church and Pope grow and be established. 8. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally if we might &amp; would assent, yet these Dutch &amp; French Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do not heare any such matters; but they are heard and handled onely by the Eldership (by them erroneously put in place of the

                  </gap> Church) as we have had experience vpon other occasions.</p>
               <p>Now though we might not (for these and like reasons) submit as they required, yet we also signifyed that if these Churches or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, or any els whosoever, could shew vs by the word of God to have faulted in any thing, we were willing and ready to heare them. These are our reasons and this is our refusall and walking in such cases. Which <hi>this White</hi> knoweth full well, and therefore his sinne is the greater, to write and deale notwithstanding as he doth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fift instance, which is about receiving <hi>the penitent offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in cases of adultery,</hi> is spoken of before, <hi>pag.</hi> 32.33. To which I refer the Reader: &amp; will now onely aske of him, whether he would have any to reteyne vnrepentant adulterers and adulteresses, and so to partake in their sinne? It may be some of his Lords the Prelates can quickly take him out as bad lessons as this: specially he being so apt a scholler for such Maisters. Yet may not we reteyne such members in our Church. And if we should, what exclamations would he make against vs, as in deed justly he might? Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mark the wickednes of this Impe of Sathan, common to him with such enemies of the truth and Church. If any stand from and against the Church, be they never so lewd &amp; wicked, he is ready to favour &amp; partake with them. But if any continue with the Church, though they repent of their sinnes as David, he will not cease to maligne and abuse them, yea &amp; to defame the whole Church ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as if it were a company of adulterers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before in his book hath appeared.</p>

               <p>For the <hi>abuses</hi> which he speaketh of, to give an instance, was not one of them our observing <hi>of that rule Mat.</hi> 18.15.16.17. in such maner as we do?

               <p>That the covenant of grace made with the Church in Christ, was without respect of persons or sexe, there being in him neyther male nor female, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. and therefore though the father should refuse or neglect, the mother hath right and ought to present.</p>
               <p>That she might not deprive her seed of the sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme vpon her husbands will, any more then her self of the Lords supper if he should forbid her, because that by the believing woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the children are clean, as well as by the believing man. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>4. &amp; she now being of our church &amp; her husband not, we were to call vpon her for performance of her duty.</p>
               <p>That baptisme was a signe of incorporating into Christ, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by his death and resurrection, so as her neglect of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her child could not but be iniurious both to Christ and it.</p>
               <p>When these &amp; the like perswasions were vsed vnto her, and she had nothing to answer but asked <hi>why then Timothees mother did not circumcise her child,</hi> our Teacher (as he remembreth) answered that the cause was not certainly knowen, for it was not expressed in the scripture: If she were living and present we would demaund of her self, but she is now dead and gone, wherefore it were hard for vs to determine of the cause, but this <hi>Ro. White</hi> was living and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent &amp; must give account of her own wayes: That we must not walk by example but by law of God: for even the most righteous may offend, &amp; Moses himself faulted in neglecting the circumcising of his sonne. <hi>Exod</hi> 4. And if Timothees mother being a Iewesse did mary with a Gentile an infidel, who therefore would not suffer her to circumcise her sonne, &amp; she obeyed him; that such mariages were forbidden of God and vnlawfull: And then she sinning in marying with him, why might she not also sin in keeping her child vncircumcised for him, if that were the cause as now this woman pretended? Wherefore she was put in minde rather of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of other good women, as Abigail, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. the elect Lady. 2 <hi>Ioh.

               <p>These and the like reasons being then shewed and spoken of, and now vpon this occasion thus noted downe, let the Reader here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of this mans dealing and his wives, and accordingly esteem thereof as now he findeth it to be. His scoffing at <hi>the Teacher of our Church,</hi> not onely for his words then vsed, but even at the office it self which he executeth (and therein at the <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7.</note>ordinance of Christ) hurteth not him nor vs, but encreaseth this skorners sinne &amp; judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon his owne head.</p>
               <p>For that which he saith of <hi>myself,</hi> I did in deed with hold my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent towching the first cause of her excommunication about the childes baptizing: making some doubt about the case aforesaid, partly in respect of the husbands authority over his family, partly because of the objections arising about the case &amp; Scriptures alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of <hi>Act.</hi> 16.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet notwithstanding I gave my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent as touching the second cause thereof, for <hi>her falling from the truth to their corruptions here</hi>: And that so, as I said also I was willing for it to pronounce the sentence my self, if the Church should so appoint. By which compared with his writing may appeare, how still he keepeth on his woonted course against vs, &amp; hath himself drawen fourth this vnfolding of his evill dealing and his wives too.</p>
               <p>For the others of whom he speaketh (viz, Mrs Sl. Goodw. Ch. &amp; R. M.) they were excommunicated for other causes then he hath noted downe. And it is not our maner to cast out any for differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of iudgement in such cases, if they be content notwithstanding to walk peaceably with the Church, and to cary themselves towards the excommunicates as they should by the word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That which he speaketh of the Magistrate is false: he did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, but perswaded vs not to do it. Though if he had or should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid

               <p>Excommunication we vse as <hi>the holy ordinaunce of God,</hi> to recover the parties that have sinned (if so it be his will) and to keep the Church from the leaven of their wickednes.

But obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, we vse the remedie which Christ hath given vs, for their good: and if it work not so in them, then is their destruction the more iust vpon their heads, and we are cleare.

            <p>For the nature of the thing, 1.

well together. 3. Whether it haue great and present need of some to be taken into office. 4. VVhether it have others in all respects, as fit to be chosen. As <hi>Paul</hi> when he refused <hi>Iohn Mark,</hi> had <hi>Silas,</hi> whome he chose to take with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.25.26.27.32.38.40.</p>
