            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>WEll overtaken, honest <hi>Bumpkin;</hi> what, your Whip in your
hand man? Prithee what's that for? and why so much
in haste?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Dear honest <hi>Citt,</hi> never better met than now; I am now going
about a Business of extraordinary Importance, and your presence (if you please
to accompany me) will be extream useful and necessary: I am going in search
of that Dissembling Tool who Nick-names himself <hi>Trueman,</hi> though indeed the
meerest <hi>Crack-fart</hi> in the World. Don't you remember him <hi>Citt?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Remember him, I that I do, too well; the first time you know, like a
cunning Sophister, he bolted out of a Closer to surprize us, a second time he
intruded into our Company in our walk to <hi>Hampsted,</hi> and then obtruded those
things upon us we never imagined.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Right, right <hi>Citt;</hi> But if I do not give him a Lace to his fine Coat (if
I can but set eyes on him) as long as this Whip lasts, never believe man more for
my sake.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Well said <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> and I'll assist thee with this Cat of Nine-tails; for
to say the Truth, I always took him to be a sharp-witted Logician, without
the least Dram of Honesty; and now the Sophister has showed us a fair pair
of heels.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Pox-on't, who'd think a man in his Coat should serve us so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Think <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> why I always thought no other; for to say the truth,
How could you reasonably expect he would stay to hazard his Neck? Come
come, think what you will, I know he is a meer <hi>Hocus,</hi> and no better.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>But whither <hi>Cit</hi> do'st intend to go to find him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66482:2"/>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>First <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> I'll tell the whither I have been to look him, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
where I intend to go, upon his own words in his <hi>Appeal,</hi> I conceived he
might very fairly have hanged himself in his Closet, since he so fairly took his
last Farewel of the World; but upon search I found it a notable Cheat, the
Bird was flown, but had left such a poisonous stink of Sedition behind him,
that at first I Protest I took his Closet for a Common-Shore; to say the truth,
I was almost stifled.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Say you so man? why I thought Sedition could not enter there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Not enter there! Faith such another word <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> will make you and
I fall out; what do ye think I tell ye a Lie? Let me assure ye, I verily believe
<hi>Machiavel</hi> himself never invented the Hundredth part of so many Political My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Villany as are there extant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Say'st thou so <hi>Citt?</hi> well but go on, where hast thou been else in
search for Monsieur <hi>Crack?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Why next I went to enquire for him at Mr. <hi>B. H.</hi>—'s, but he poor man
Protests he had not seen him never since he Publickly absented himself, and
to tell thee the truth, for ought I understand, he has showed him but a kind of
a slippery trick.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>As how pray?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Why I'll tell thee <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> This <hi>B. H.</hi>—is a man who has an itching
desire for the Philosopher's Stone, which our <hi>Crack</hi> (for <hi>Trueman</hi> is not his
right Name) promised to help him to in a small time; and to say the truth,
he had so great Confidence in his words, that he hardly conceived himself In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to the King of <hi>Morocco;</hi> in the mean time, our sly Politician <hi>Crack,</hi> makes
an exchange with his Chapman <hi>(viz.)</hi> Wast Paper for good Gold, assuring him
withal, nothing could more speedily effect his desire; but since <hi>Crack</hi> has ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
himself, his poor Chapman is ready to gnaw his Thumbs off, as a revenge
for his Folly, and looks as Pale in the Face, as the old Woman that broke her
Jaws with eating thick Milk at <hi>Islington,</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Troth <hi>Citt.</hi> you make me Laugh at this humour; but where else have
you been in his search pray?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Why I'll tell you <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> my next and last Journey was to <hi>M.</hi>—Coffee-House,
and I mist of him there but very narrowly; for he had left his old scent
behind him, the very Room was perfum'd by the scent he left; I thereupon paid
for my Dish, and thought to track him by the scent, which I forthwith did, but
with no success; and now honest <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> if thou wilt accompany me, I'll tell
thee whither I design next to go in search of this Animal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Honest dear <hi>Citt,</hi> tell me presently, for I protest my Fingers itch to
have a fling at his Arse, he hath so notoriously abused us both; I hope you'll
Second me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>If I don't <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> take me for a half-Spirited Fool; and I am sure you
know better.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Come then, let's jogg on, and talk on it as we go.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis done <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> agreed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>But which way shall we steer our Course <hi>Citt,</hi> and not lose our labour?
for I am stark wild till I find him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Faith my Opinion is, if we could find but a Cabal of Jesuists, we should
find him Spoaksman to the Company; you know he is a Plaguy Fellow, and
has his Pen and Tongue at will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Troth well thought on, but now I consider better, these Vermin are
so disguised, that it is as hard to find them, as the Party we look for; they are a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66482:2"/>
sort of Plaguy cunning Shifters, and play so many <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> Tricks, that if
we should by chance hit in among them, we should scarce know them in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Truly <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> I fear so too; but however 'tis but Labour lost, let's
venture however.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, let's first steer our Course towards the water side, and call
a Boat, and go on Board the <hi>Vanherring,</hi> my life for yours he has no small
Acquaintance amongst the <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>I care not much if we do, and I believe it a very probable Course; but
how shall we do to get him on shore if we chance to find him; for we must not
attempt any thing on Board.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Faith <hi>Citt,</hi> I'll tell thee, Let us each take the care to provide us a
Garment that may bespeak us <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and we may happily effect our
Desires. What think ye?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>But I cannot well speak their Language.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Why <hi>Citt,</hi> I did not take thee before to be so much a Child, or a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
they all speak the same Language as we do as to Outward appearance; when
we are thus accoutred, you need say no more, but that a Friend would speak
with him at the Pope's Head, and he immediately comes on shore.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Come then, let's go, and fit our selves with a convenient Garb, and away
as fast as we can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bump.</speaker>
               <p>Let's strike into this Shop then, and furnish our selves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>

               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>I would have them trim'd with a competent Shoulder-Knot of seeming
Honesty, my Coat lin'd with Equivocations; in a word Sir, you know what
belongs to a true <hi>Mahometan</hi> Dress; Pray let's have two of the newest Fashion,
one for my Self, another for my Friend.</p>

each an entire Suit, except a Hempen Cravat, for that begins to grow out
of Fashion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Shopkeeper.</speaker>
               <p>In a word Sir, the two Suits are worth 12 <hi>l.</hi> as well as a Jesuit
is worth a Halter; but I'll abate you Six Shillings in the two because you
take them together.</p>
