            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the bonnie white Bul, the ardent heates of <hi>Paſiphaë</hi>
were more &amp; more increaſed; in ſo much that one horne of his

euen ſo as ſoone as the bruite of moſt bountifull <hi>Bacchus</hi>

choaked with a marueilous drie heat, which he of late had got
by lifting ouerlong at old mother <hi>Redcaps;</hi> this <hi>Tom Typſay,</hi>
I ſay, with a wel tried tankard trailing at his taile: the more
he thought of <hi>Bacchus</hi> bountie, the more he deſired to trie the
experience: and the further hée laboured after his liking; the
longer he luſted after his liquor: wiſhing at euery foote, the
worthie preſence of ſo gracious a God.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Tom Typſay,</hi> not only in hope to tipple with the beſt,
but truſting to merite a further rewarde: fell flat downe on

he rouſed vp his moyſty head, and from a muddie mufe
ſo cléered vp his cherilike countenance, that the maieſtie of
his noſe ſéemed as the beames of the ſunne ſhining along
throughout the coaſtes of <hi>Archadie.</hi> But miſſing the ſight
of him whom he lately heard, forthwith he tumbled vpon his

which to him was imparted by <hi>Euriopazeus;</hi> he ſaw
<hi>Tom Tipſay</hi> in an excéeding quandary, in ſo much that <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
for very pittie, through the might of his deitie, ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſoared through the airie region, that in a moment he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried
this perplexed Tapſter, and drawing nere him, he hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtd
him after this maner.</p>
            <p>Whereas (my friend) thy groanes are ſo great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous,
that they haue aſcended the hieſt cloudes, which cry out
in thy behalfe for my accuſtomed clemency, and pierced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
into my bountifull tunne, which now troubled with the
ſharpnes of thy ſpéech, threates out a danger to her former
ſwauitie: behold <hi>Bacchus, Bacchus</hi> I ſay, thy beſt beloued god,
ready preſt to performe what thou art willing to demaunde.</p>
            <p>Say on therefore boldly and feare not: and withall know
this, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> hath not only a care to kéepe his clients in
ſafety, but great cauſe (no doubt) to preſerue them in felicity:
for who is he that hath euer heard, much leſſe ſéene, that any
of the gods, at any time ſo tendred the welfare of their ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
as from age to age, both dayly and hourely béen ſéene in
me. The tyrannie of <hi>Iupiter</hi> is teſtified by his threatning
thunderbolte: the malice of <hi>Mars</hi> is expreſſed by his bloody
blade. The outrage of <hi>Pallas</hi> is diſſembled by the booke; but
euidently perceiued by the piercing launce. The broyles of
<hi>Pan</hi> are performed by the crooke. The furie of <hi>Syluanus</hi> is
knowne by the Clubbe: the diſmall decrées of <hi>Diana</hi> are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by her dartes, and to be briefe, all the other gods and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes,
<hi>Hercules</hi> like are cloyed with ſuch cholericke clubbs;
that their mouthes taſte nothing ſauing wordes of wrath,
and their déeds ſéeme vndecent, vnleſſe they ſmel of reuenge.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Bacchus</hi> that braue god, whom thou ſéeſt here preſent,
<pb facs="tcp:5926:7"/>
abhorreth that his wightes ſhould bee wearied with the
waight of ſuch vnweildie weapons. No, no, I beare (as thou
maieſt ſée) a beautifull braunch of goodly grapes in token of
ioy &amp; gladnes: whereas the terrour of other gods, to the griefe
of many, doth prognoſticate ſorrow and ſadnes.</p>
            <p>Now therefore Tapſter, if thou wilt be as readie to make
trial of my bountie, as I willing to inuite thée to my banquet;
beholde, Whilſon-wéeke is néere at hand, then are my feaſts
called <hi>Bacchanalia;</hi> then reſort together the whole band of
<hi>Bacchus</hi> in their chiefeſt brauerie, amongſt whome (if it ſo
pleaſe thée) thou ſhalt be entertained as a gueſt moſt welcom

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tom Typſay</hi> hearing ſo courteous a diſcourſe, as a man
marueilouſly amazed for ioy, ſtood a long time ſtaring in <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
face, not able poore ſoule (as then) to make a reply. But
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> a perfect phiſitian willing to preſerue his patient in
ſo pitifull a plight, reuiued his ſpirites with the ſwéet moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of his tunne, and refreſhed his braines with the iuice of
his grapes. Hereat <hi>Tom Typſay</hi> awaking as it were from a
drouſie ſlumber, yéelded to his god <hi>Bacchus</hi> a tub full of
thankes, and promiſed at the time appointed to bée there
with the firſt. Yet becauſe hée knew not the place, hée deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of him thus.</p>
            <p>Sith your worſhips godhead hath vouchſafed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
my companie to ſo famous a feaſt; let it not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
your maieſtie to put mee in memorie of the place:
elſe by the maſſe, I promiſe you, I feare mée, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
finde out your honours houſe; I pray you ſir how do you
call it?</p>
            <p>To reſolue this doubt (quoth <hi>Bacchus</hi>) vnderſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that my manſion houſe is called <hi>Alepotto,</hi> ſcituate on
the ſouth ſide of <hi>Quaffington,</hi> enquire for mée at the ſigne
of the ſcarlet noſe, and from thence ſhalt thou bée ſet aright
into <hi>Beerebury</hi> lane, ſo that being there, thou canſt not
miſſe to finde out my palace, for thou ſhalt plainely ſée it
before thine eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5926:7"/>
Hereat <hi>Tom Typſay</hi> made a long legge, vowing to bée
there without faile, and <hi>Bacchus</hi> willing to diſmiſſe him,
bleſſed the Tapſters tankard with part of his bountie, and
thereupon departed.</p>
            <p>Thus the Tapſter in great haſte hies him home as mery
as any hare in the moneth of March. For whereas before
this ſo comfortable a conference, hée was ſo lazie, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
foote ſéemed to haue a leaden héele: euerie legge in
ſuch a quandarie, as though they had tooke ſome new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the goute; yea his very head ſo heauie,
as if it had béene harneſſed in an horſe-nightcap: and his
whole bodie ſo diſtempered, as though he had beene prickt
to the very heart with a belclapper: beholde, nowe the
caſe is altred, and hée is altogether become another man:
for now is hée as nimble as a dogs taile, as couragious
as a butterflie, and as merrie at the heart, as the beſt
paire of bagpipes in all the countrey.</p>
            <p>But as times are altred, ſo diuers accidents are infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Happie was <hi>Midas</hi> when it was graunted vnto
him, that all which hée touched ſhould bée golde: but ſoone
haples againe, when his meate was metamorphoſed into
metall, and hée with his wiſh ready to ſtarue. Glad was
<hi>Acteon</hi> at the ſight of <hi>Diana,</hi> when ſhee bathed her ſelfe
amongſt her nimphes: but luckles was his lot, when
ſhortly after hée became himſelfe a preſent pray to bée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
of his owne dogs. And ioyfull was <hi>Tom Typſay</hi> in
remembraunce of the bountie of his god <hi>Bacchus,</hi> but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
alas at his returne when firſt hée came within
the viewe of his wife: for ſhée (as is the manner of all
headie huſwiues, whoſe tongues are more readie to raue,
than their hands to worke) not ſticking one iot to teache
him a new leſſon, tooke him roundly by the topping, and
welcomed him home after this manner.</p>
            <p>Ah ah ſirra, I ſée by Aſtronomie that the Moone is
euen now at full, and the ſigne ſetled iuſt in the noſe: in ſo
<pb facs="tcp:5926:8"/>
much that (as by all mathematicall probabilities I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture)
backe and bellie may this yeare both goe bare, ſo
that there be no want of harnes for the head. Well, well I
néed not to tel thée what thou art, the gilding of thy noſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
bewraies thy good behauiour. In ſo much that either
<hi>Luna</hi> hath come downe alone, and in taking thée for her olde
<hi>Endimion,</hi> hath made thée her newe Moone face: or (as thy
tottering too and fro doth plainely teſtifie) thou haſt had ſome
long tariance at <hi>Simon Soakers</hi> houſe, the coppernoſe ſmith,
your euer aſſured friend. But one thing aſſure thée, for ſo am
I certainely perſwaded, that as the diuell hath already dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
thée for a drunkard: ſo hereafter, one time or other, but
neuer too late, <hi>Don Tyburne</hi> will inuite thée to a liueles feaſt,
and teach thée the croſſe caper in an halfepennie halter. And
thus in a fuſtian fume flung away.</p>
            <p>If true it be, as many report, that a curſt queanes tongue
is as ſharpe as a razor: experience then proueth, that this
poore ſhaueling néeded no better a barber. How euer it be, I
will referre it to their rehearſall, which haue had their
crownes ſmoothed as well with a crabtrée combe, as thoſe
which haue tried the ſharpnes of the ſiſers.</p>
            <p>But euen as the clap of the thunder the greater it is, the
ſooner it ceaſeth: and the blaſtes of <hi>Boreas</hi> the more furious
they are, the leſſe while is their continuance: ſo likewiſe, a
womans mouth the more full it is of wordes, the leſſe it is of
force, and ſooner it waſteth into winde. The falling out of
louers is the renuing of loue, and the bitternes of the tongue
is eaſely ſeaſoned with the ſwéetnes of the lippes: for what
with pleaſing ſpéeches, ſwéete conceipts, the clinking of the
pot, and the drinking of new <hi>Nectar,</hi> theſe two ſwéete ſoules
became both as one, and the heate of their former furies were
frozen vp as it were into a lake of euerlaſting loue.</p>
            <p>Thus whiles this couple continued in ſolacing themſelues
to their hearts content, behold Whitſontide drew on: and to
be briefe, away they both doe walke to the banquet, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
theſe gueſtes were wrapped vp in their chiefeſt roabes;
<pb facs="tcp:5926:8"/>
it wil not be a miſſe to deſcribe them in their chéefeſt brauery,

               <l>About his neck he wore a ruffe</l>

               <l>His back was ridged like a boare,</l>

               <l>There hangs a tap betweene his legs</l>
               <l>From whence he turneth foorth his dregs.</l>
               <l>On either hand was placde a cuffe,</l>

And here deſcribed is the gueſt</l>

            <p>Now as concerning the coſtly attire of the Tapſters wiſe,
becauſe I am in haſt at this time, I am rather willing to ſlip
ouer ſo cumberſome a matter with filence, than to trouble i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
heads with matters of ſo great importaunce.</p>
            <p>As they thus traueled togeather, at length they obteined
their long deſired hauen, and entered into the Pallace of
god <hi>Bacchus,</hi> where they were, ſo worthilie entertayned,
that the ſunne in his midday ſpheare ſhining out moſt bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
doth ſcarce halfe repreſent ſuch glorie, as was by report
ſéene in this feaſt. For whereas commonly now a daies, wée
either inuite them of our acquaintance, or ſuch whoſe new-found
friendſhip may be as meanes to cure olde ſoares: this
mightie god <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to the wonder of the worlde, inuiteth
not onely ſuch as bée his familiars, but men altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
as well the poore as the rich.</p>
            <p>Sée then the goodnes of this ſo gracious a god, al yée, which
in the drieſt drought of ſummer had rather ſhroude your
throates with a handfull of hemp, then with the expence of
an odde Crinclepouch waſh your ſelues within and without,
and make your ſelues as mery as dawes: yea learne yée nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
at god <hi>Bacchus</hi> to bée liuely; whoſe eſpeciall fauour
ſpreads out it ſelfe ſo far, that euery nation doth magnifie his
name, euery countrey ſpeakes in his commendation and all
people paint him out with pen and penſill, in ſo much that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
himſelfe doth wonder at his worthines.</p>
            <p>But to returne from whence I came, their entertainment
I ſay was ſuch, that they rather thought themſelues tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
into <hi>Paradice</hi> that place of pleaſure, then remayning
in any earthly habitation: for there they ſaw a royal reſort as
well of all lands and languages, as of all degrées and callings
whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>There was <hi>Ganimedes</hi> ſent from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> to imploy his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice

furniſh this feaſt with all ſolemnitie. There was <hi>Sylenus,</hi> a
ſtately ſeruitour, waiting at euery winke, &amp; preuenting euery
want. Yea ſuch was the bounty of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> that he ſent downe
to <hi>Plutus</hi> prince of hell, and craued the company of diuers his

            <p>Thither rode great <hi>Alexander</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the back of prauncing <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalus,</hi>

looſe that he had in turning downe his liquor, was called <hi>Bicon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius;</hi>
with him came the blockheaded <hi>Balatronus,</hi> and <hi>Vibidius,
Mecenas</hi> trencher-mates: &amp; that old huddle and twang <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi>
the ſhadow of Saint <hi>Socrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Proſerpina</hi> the infernall quéene, willing to honour <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
in what ſhe might, releaſeth <hi>Tantalus</hi> from out of the riuer,
cauſeth <hi>Syſiphus</hi> to ceaſe from his tumbling taſke, ſets <hi>Ixion</hi> frée
from his torture: cals downe <hi>Prometheus,</hi> and compels the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
deuouring his heart, to ceaſe from their pray, and for the

to depart.</p>
            <p>Glad were they to be releaſed tho but for a time, and glad was
<hi>Bacchus</hi> that it was his lot to welcome ſuch willing gueſtes.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Bacchus</hi> was thus moſt buſie amongſt his friends, behold
a reuerend route reſorted towardſt his court with a trumpet
before them ſounding moſt melodiouſly in token of great ioy,

therewith might baſte his belly, when it was ready to crack,
with licking vp ouer lauiſhly the ſmall crums that tumbled out of
his tunne.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenth was one <hi>Simon Swil-kan,</hi> he came from <hi>Colops</hi> a
citie in <hi>Africa,</hi> and preſented to <hi>Bacchus</hi> a buttock of Bacon:
which broyled on the coales, and ſo eaten, will ſet a man on
longing for his liquor before ſunne ſhine, bee the morning neuer
ſo moyſty.</p>
            <p>The eight was of <hi>Capſa,</hi> a towne well knowne in <hi>Numidia:</hi>

<hi>Iberia,</hi> and one of the ſect of Saint <hi>Sinckator.</hi> This <hi>Philip</hi> was
a phiſition, and brought to his god <hi>Bacchus</hi> a certaine potion,
merueilous in operation, of which who euer he were that did
drinke after hee had beene well whitled, by vertue thereof, if
hee once were a ſleepe, ſhoulde neuer awake till hee were
wiſer.</p>
            <p>The 11. was a Iewe borne in <hi>Ioppa,</hi> hee had to name <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher

            <p>The 14. was called <hi>Hodge Heauie-breech,</hi> hee came frome
<hi>Miſerga</hi> a cittie in the confines of <hi>Perſia: Hodge</hi> by his

occupation was a Cardmaker, who for the zeale he had to god <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
and al good fellows, offered vp to him that renowmed ruffler
the knaue of <hi>Clubs,</hi> with a box of trim trillilles, commonly called
the dice: the one to aide him in a needeles combat, the other after
his loſſe, to ſerue him in ſtead of recreation.</p>
            <p>The 15. was one <hi>Maudlen Moonface,</hi> a mery gentlewoman

            <p>The 16. was a pleaſant <hi>Parthian</hi> of the ſtately cittie <hi>Catompy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>

very gratefully.</p>
            <p>The 17. was borne in <hi>India,</hi> at a faire citie called <hi>Tyndis,</hi> this
forſooth was a coy dame, called <hi>Cate Craſhpot,</hi> ſhe came clincking

            <p>The 18. was one <hi>Baudwin Barrelbely</hi> from <hi>Ormuſa,</hi> a place
ſufficiently knowne in the ile of <hi>Cypruſſe,</hi> with him he brought a
firkin full of wine of <hi>Baſterdes:</hi> aſſuring god <hi>Bacchus</hi> on his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that ſo many as he made thereof partakers with him, as long
as they applied themſelues to the harty carouſe, ſhould neuer be
daunted by death, and faile footing.</p>
            <p>The 19. came from <hi>Garma</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> called <hi>Goody Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale:</hi>
ſhee (in token of pure deuotion) deliuered to <hi>Bacchus</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that neither grape nor very might in any reſpect be compared
to the maieſtie of the mault.</p>
            <p>The 20. was a worthie yeoman, one <hi>Tom Toſpot,</hi> he came from
<hi>Friburgum</hi> an <hi>Heluetian,</hi> he as willing to pleaſure himſelfe, as to
honour his god, preſented to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> a dainty deuiſed compound,
of ſundry ſimples paſtiewiſe, as the trimming of tripes, the fat of

chitterlings, and the marrow of ſwéet ſouſe, lapt vp altogether

with the beſt increments of his ouer-flawing tunne.</p>
            <p>When theſe had ended their deuotion, they were placed all in

            <p>Scarſe had they tipled gyrum wiſe, as commonly the ſect of

            </lg>
            <p>This ſong thus ended, the whole hall for ioy did ring out a loud
laffing peale, and thanked the fidler for his mirth. <hi>Bacchus</hi> made
him drinke, <hi>Silenus</hi> bad him not ſpare, ſo <hi>Barlicap</hi> did drink till his
eyes did ſtare.</p>
            <p>Thus euery man falls to his taſke, and hee happie that is able
<pb facs="tcp:5926:12"/>
to ſtand ſtoutly in the forefront, to giue the braueſt onſet.</p>
            <p>Whiles thus they tipled, the fidler he fidled, and the pots dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for ioy the old hop about, commonly called Sellengars round:
euery man ſet to his foot, there was not whip ſnatch and away, but
plaine rack and manger, where euery one dranke himſelfe out of
danger: cups and cans went clip clap, the gueſts were al welcome,
their tongues ran at randome, ſir <hi>Prattle</hi> kept a wrangling, and
dame <hi>Tattle</hi> a great iangling, each one was mery, &amp; no man wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
words to ſolace his next neighbour: to be briefe, heauen was
here, and hell where they were not, yea who but the gueſts of god
<hi>Bacchus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amids theſe only pleaſures, and ioyes incomparable, <hi>Iupiter</hi>
ſends downe <hi>Mercury</hi> to make them pleaſant: &amp; <hi>Venus</hi> the queene

and to lead them along blindfold vnto luſt &amp; loathſome ſelf-liking.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Pluto</hi> the maſter diuell of hell ſeeing fit opportunity and
place conuenient, ſent amongſt the ioyfull gueſts of this feaſt, the
furies of hell, who with all ſpeed poſted to god <hi>Bacchus</hi> pallace, to
exerciſe their helliſh outrage.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Cupid</hi> lingred not out his time, but did driue his dartes
amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſuch force, that ſome for pure loue wedded them

ſome matched themſelues only to Metheglin, one liked this,
another that, all was wonderfull to behold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bawdwin Barrelbelly</hi> was greatly grieued with loue gripes,
eſpecially through the deſire hee had to goody <hi>Goodale</hi> the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kit Crabface</hi> ſo ardently burned in the loue of <hi>Maudlin Moone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>
that well nere he burned himſelfe to aſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercury</hi> he caſt his eloquence amongſt them by horſe loades at
once, ſo that large promiſes with no performance, were as eaſie to
be heard, as ſmall bells in a morrice daunce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meduſa, Megera</hi> and the reſt of thoſe furious hags, flie al at once
in amongſt them, and ſets their teeth on edge to practiſe villanie,
one againſt another: one puls his felow by the beard without cauſe;
another crackes his next felowes crowne with a quart pot, one
flings a glaſſe in another mans face, another makes a buckler of
<pb facs="tcp:5926:12"/>
his hat to ſaue himſelfe before, whiles another with a black iack
breakes his head behinde: one cries downe with him, downe with
him, not able of himſelfe to kill a louſe, another lies lurking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the table altogether ſpeechles.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Dauid Drithroat</hi> gathered vp his teeth, which <hi>Pierſe
Spendall</hi> the Frier had lately ſtrooke out, becauſe <hi>Dauid</hi> like an
vnmannerly knaue, preſumed to piſſe in the holy water pot.</p>
            <p>There <hi>Gotfrey Grouthead</hi> begins to fume, and fometh at the
mouth like a ſauage bore, hee falls at variance with miſtris <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godowne,</hi>
and hales her along by the haire of the haead: in ſo much
that (thou knaue) was as common amongſt them as cartway, or
<hi>probo</hi> in the ſchooles: and (thou whore) as vſuall a terme, as hait
hary in the mouth of a carter.</p>
            <p>Whiles thus they lay on heapes, one on the neck of another,
ſome ſpurning others w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their heeles, ſome ſcratching their heads
where they itched not, ſome ſprauling vnderneath moſt glad to
riſe vp againe, ſome wiping the blood away from their faces: ſome
rubbing their ſhinnes which they burſt on the frames: ſome gaping
for winde, almoſt choked with flies, while theſe, I ſay, did lie in
this ſo great diſorder, the gods aboue were conſtrained to winke
at their follies, and the diuels below reioyced at the viewe of this
our mortall wretchednes.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Bacchus</hi> aroſe, with the reſt of his Barons, and diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
euery man very bountifully: who after long ſtumbling, at the
laſt returned from whence they came. And <hi>Bacchus</hi> himſelfe reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Archadie,</hi> whereat this day, for his ſingular liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
&amp; bounteous behauiour towardes all inhabitants
trauellers &amp; paſſengers, he is of power to make
a greater companie of able men then
any man of his degree.</p>
