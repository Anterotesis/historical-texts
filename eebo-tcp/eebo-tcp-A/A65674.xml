            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT may not perhaps, for some Reasons, be improper
in it self, or unacceptable to the Reader, to
have a short History of the Occasions and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of the discovery of the several Particulars
in the <hi>New Theory;</hi> and to see by what steps I
proceeded in that matter: that at once I may claim
to my self what Interest or Right I really had in the
same; and it may appear how far, and in what
manner any other Persons or Opportunities were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
therein: and at the same time the Reader
may perceive how little Affinity there is between a
bare Hypothesis, the product only of the Wit and
Skill of the Inventor, and the several Branches of a
<hi>Theory</hi> in which the foregoing Qualifications were
not necessary, and so can or ought to be very little
consider'd therein. To wave therefore any more
words by way of Introduction, I shall come to that
Account it self, which is the single Subject of this
Preface.</p>
            <p>The Reader is therefore to know, that ever since
I saw the University, and began to rellish the New
Philosophy; I mean particularly the <hi>Cartesian,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with some other later discoveries of a more solid
nature, I withal fell into an exceeding liking of the
main part of Dr. <hi>Burnet's Theory of the Earth;</hi>
and thought my self never more pleas'd than in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
perusal of so ingenious and remarkable a Book.
Insomuch that upon my being to perform the accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Exercise in the Schools for my first degree, one of
my Positions was in Vindication of the same. This
<pb facs="tcp:106675:3"/>
good liking continued with me a great while after;
till my deeper researches into Mechanical Philosophy,
and the Discoveries contain'd in Mr. <hi>Newton's</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Book began to convince me of the Indefensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of many of the particulars; and that the
whole Scheme, as it then lay, could not be justify'd
by the Principles of sound Philosophy; nor did it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
better consideration, agree with the accounts in the
Holy Scriptures. Yet still several of the particulars,
especially the <hi>Perpetual Equinox</hi> before the Flood;
and the Situation of the Earth upon a <hi>Fluid Abyss,</hi>
seem'd very reasonable, and very agreeable to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
Sacred and Profane of those ancient Ages of
the World. And as I have never yet found reason
to alter my Opinion about the <hi>latter,</hi> when duly
stated; so I was in great perplexity how to believe
the <hi>former;</hi> since I found the way of changing the
Position of the Earth's <hi>Axis</hi> in Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> by the
Laws of Mechanism plainly impossible; on which yet
<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>he before mention'd Opinion did in great measure
depend.</p>
            <p>In this doubtfulness of Mind, a Thought came into
my head (since which I believe 'tis now at the least
five or six Years.) That from Mr. <hi>Newton's</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
'twas certain that a Comet might pass near
the Earth; and that also in case it pass'd near enough
and in a certain <hi>trajectory,</hi> it might alter the Position
of the Earth's <hi>Axis,</hi> as now the Sun does, backward
and forward every year: (tho' this be a thing only
known to those who have made some progress in
Mr. <hi>Newton's</hi> Book, and not here to be explain'd
for every Reader.) I thought it therefore worth my
while, after a long time, to try whether, by this means,
if a Comet, in the most advantagious manner possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
came near the Earth at the Deluge, the Earth's
<hi>Axis</hi> could be thereby chang'd from a Parallelism to
<pb facs="tcp:106675:3"/>
that of the Ecliptick, to the Obliquity of 23Â½ Degrees,
which it has had ever since that time. This calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
I try'd about <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December</hi> 1694.
But could by no means perceive that the hundredth
part of the present Obliquity was by any such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to be accounted for. Which occasion'd therefore
my laying aside that Hypothesis I had so long before
been fond of, and desirous to establish; and permitted
my Thoughts a greater freedom about the occasions of
the Deluge, than Dr. <hi>Burnet's</hi> Notions had allow'd
me before.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, considering the Nature of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
and viewing sometimes Mr. <hi>Newton's</hi> Scheme
of the last famous one among us, which my self could
easily remember, in 1680 and 1681. A Thought
came into my mind, which in discourse I mention'd
to a very Learned Friend,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi>
               </note> that 'twas possible the Tail
of a Comet might afford Water at the Deluge, and
that the confused Mass of Air, and irregular Steams
from the Comet's Atmosphere or Tail might afford a
fair Solution of that <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> I had been so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of the Perpetual Equinox to account for before:
I mean the unhealthy state of our Air and Earth at
present, and the effect thereof, the shortning of Mens
lives ever since the Deluge. These were my first and
crude thoughts of this matter; which tho' the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
were but ill adjusted, and uncertain; yet gave
me an eagerness of considering the matter farther, and
occasion'd all the subsequent discoveries which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the <hi>New Theory.</hi> And truly, upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
farther consideration, now the hint was once given,
I soon found that a great many of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
of Nature, and of the Deluge, did of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
fall in with my Notion; and that if on its
Original Formation, the Inward constitution of the
Earth were suppos'd a Fluid, (as I had long done,
<pb facs="tcp:106675:4"/>
tho' on no good consideration of the nature of that
Fluid;) and if withal the Inequality of the Earth's
Surface at first, which Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> positively deny'd,
could be Mechanically accounted for, I then imagin'd
I could go a great way in a new Hypothesis of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Creation, and the Deluge. At which time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Easter</hi> 1695, Dr. <hi>Woodward's Essay</hi> was
made publick; and read by me with a great deal of
eagerness and sollicitude, to see whether the History of
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Inward parts of the Earth
would accord with, or contradict those Notions I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to entertain about the Points before-mention'd.
And as a little before I had observ'd, that 'twas
highly reasonable to suppose a Fluid nearer the Center
of the Earth to be heavier than those upon its Surface;
yea than that Orb of Earth which was above it; so,
as I was reading Dr. <hi>Woodward's Essay,</hi> That
Axiom also in <hi>Hydrostaticks,</hi> that Bodies according
to their different specifick Gravities will sink into Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids
in a different proportions, and so be extant in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
degrees; came into my thoughts; upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
I know not: and together, eas'd me, to my
no small satisfaction, of the Difficulties which before
stopp'd my progress in that Hypothesis my Thoughts
were so busy upon.</p>
            <p>Having now got the main strokes of the New
Theory, so far as concern'd the particular <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
of the Deluge at least, in my mind: and not
finding the Observations in Dr. <hi>Woodward's Essay</hi>
wholly disagreeable to the same, I began to write my
Thoughts, and digest 'em into as regular a method,
as the warmth of my Temper, still increas'd by the
daily addition of new, and to me very surprizing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
would permit. About which time I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that if the Comet pass'd by the Earth at the
Deluge, it must alter the annual Motion and Period,
<pb facs="tcp:106675:4"/>
from the Universality of the Law of Attraction, so
fully demonstrated by Mr. <hi>Newton.</hi> Whereupon I
went to try whether, if the Earth mov'd in a Circle
before the Flood, the becoming Eccentrical at that time
would account for, and correspond to those 5Â¼ odd Days,
which we now have in ours above 360, an <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ven and
regular Year, which I was willing to imagin the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tediluvians</hi>
had enjoy'd. But as this Calculation
fail'd my present Hopes, so it discover'd a Coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
vastly more remarkable; namely, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Solar Year, if the Earth's Orbit was Circular, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
corresponded with the present and ancient Lunar,
by reason of the accurate Equality and Agreement of
the <hi>Eccentricity</hi> of the Earth with the <hi>Lunar Epact.</hi>
Which Coincidence I must own did in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
please and satisfy my Thoughts; and gave me
some assurance of the <hi>truth,</hi> as well as <hi>probability</hi>
of my main Hypothesis.</p>
            <p>Soon after this I discern'd another most remarkable
way of trying the Reality of the Passing by of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met;
namely, to see whether the Place of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helion,</hi>
at which I perceiv'd the Deluge must, on my
Hypothesis, begin, would accord with the Time of the
Year deliver'd by <hi>Moses.</hi> This, with no small fear
of a disappointment, I try'd: and having only I think
<hi>Tycho's</hi> Tables of its Motion then by me (in
<hi>Mercator's</hi> Astronomy,) I consulted it accordingly,
and to my still higher satisfaction and assurance found
the Astronomical Tables, and the Mosaick History,
exactly to agree in the same Time of the second Month
from the Autumnal Equinox.</p>
            <p>Soon after this I found out another still more sure
way of discovering the <hi>time,</hi> nay the very <hi>day</hi> of the
beginning of the Flood from Astronomy, and so of
trying whether the former coincidences were by chance,
or occasion'd by the reality of that Passage of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
<pb facs="tcp:106675:5"/>
to which I ascribed the Deluge. Now in this
case, tho' I saw the necessity of the day of the Comets
passing by being near the New or Full Moon, yet I
was not then well enough vers'd in Astronomical cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
readily to try this matter; and besides did
not know how many years ought to be accounted since
the Deluge, because of my own unacquaintedness with
the point then, and of the variety of Chronologers
Sentiments about it. However, since I look'd upon the
most Learned, the Lord Bishop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and
<hi>Lichfield,</hi> (whose most free, ready, and generous
Assistance in all my Studies, I must own with the
highest Gratitude) as by common consent, the
most Accurate Chronologer of this Age; and did
remember that in a Bible which lay in his Study I
had formerly observ'd the Year of the World 4004,
set in the beginning of St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> I suppos'd his
Lordship's opinion to be that from the <hi>Herbrew</hi> Verity,
the Christian <hi>AEra,</hi> began <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 4004. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Supposition, tho' with great diffidence of
mistake on every side, I try'd to find the time of the
Moon corresponding to the beginning of the Deluge;
and found it to be as near the <hi>new</hi> as my Hypothesis
requir'd. Which exceedingly pleas'd me at the present,
but gave me a new Sollicitude lest it should overturn
all in case I had made any mistake in the Chronology,
since the Deluge; which <hi>then</hi> at best only depended on
the memory of a number I had occasionally seen before;
tho' since I have received full satisfaction in the point.
In great concern therefore I went down to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Lodgings, and with no small fear, enquir'd of
the truth of what I had remembred, and of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
opinion touching the number of Years according
to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verity, till the Christian <hi>AEra;</hi> And
found I was exactly right in the whole, to my no small
encouragement, and to my greater assurance of the
<pb facs="tcp:106675:5"/>
certain truth of that Hypothesis which by so many
trials had, beyond expectation, approved it self to me.</p>
            <p>After all this I discover'd, as I thought, that the
Ocean was an effect and remains of the Waters of the
Deluge; and that the passing by of the Comet would
distinguish the Earth into two Continents, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an Ocean betwixt 'em. But here in my first
thoughts I was stopt a little, and fear'd that this last
Hypothesis would overturn my other; because the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the Centers of the two Continents would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the time of the Year when the Comet pass'd
by; and that, as my first thoughts represented to me,
in a downright opposition to my other accounts of that
matter. But it proved quite otherwise, for as all my
former fears had come to nothing, but ended to my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
satisfaction; so on a more exact consideration I
found this position of the Centers of the two Continents
so exactly agreeable with the time of the beginning of
the Deluge stated by the other methods, that instead
of contradicting, I perceiv'd, with pleasure enough, it
highly confirm'd and secur'd the same. And then, as
to the bigness of the Comet, and the several other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidences
all along, they generally occur'd readily to
my thoughts as I went on; and so need not have any
particular notice taken of them in this place.</p>
            <p>But I think somewhat before I had proceeded so
far, I drew up a hasty imperfect draught of my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to communicate to some Friends, and especially
to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> immediately, and the Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>
afterwards, whom I accordingly waited on, the first
at <hi>London,</hi> and the other as I (in attendance on my
Lord Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi>) pass'd by <hi>Cambridge;</hi>
which was, I think, about <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> the same
Year 1695. And having now by the Hints and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
I received from these Learned Persons, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from the latter; and by a more accurate review
<pb facs="tcp:106675:6"/>
and reconsideration of the whole, much corrected, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
and enlarged my Hypothesis; and took in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Particulars more as they occurr'd to me; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that most remarkable one about the lowness of
<hi>Caucasus</hi> now, and its greater altitude at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
on which I lay so much stress in my Book,<note place="margin">Coroll. 3, &amp; 4. post Solut. 59.</note> I
found my self prepar'd to digest the whole into a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme,
and began to make it ready for Mr. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's</hi>
Review, and to think of putting it into the
Press. Only I was still somewhat puzled about Dr.
<hi>Woodward's</hi> Observation of the time of the Year in
which all the Plants buried at the Deluge were lodg'd
in their several places; whence he had stated the
commencing thereof half a Year differently from that
which all my ways of determining it assur'd me of.</p>
            <p>In this difficulty I wrote to the Doctor for a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some Queries relating to those Plants, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
such an answer, part of which is in my Book, as
gave me sufficient foundation, I thought, to clear the
difficulty, and turn'd what was before a shrewd Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against, into a real attestation to that time of
the Year which my Hypothesis assign'd in the Case.
Being thus clear of my difficulties, I went on with my
work with considerable application, and no small de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of pleasure and satisfaction; till I brought it to
an intire Systeme, and sent it to <hi>Cambridge</hi> for Mr.
<hi>Newton's</hi> final Review and Correction. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over, and communicated to me, I soon brought it
into the present form, and only added that <hi>Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Discourse,</hi> which partly on another occasion, I
had in good measure finish'd before; and which I found
would be but a necessary preparation to some points of
great moment in the following <hi>Theory.</hi> This is a true
and faithful account, as far as my memory can now
recollect the Particulars, of the progress of this matter,
and of the occasions of the several discoveries contain'd
in the <hi>New Theory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106675:6"/>'Tis true, when I brought my Manuscript to
Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> the first time, he told me (what I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard syllable of before; and of which I know
nothing particularly to this hour:) that he had heard,
That Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> (a Person sufficiently, and deservedly
Eminent in the Learned World) had propos'd Reasons
at <hi>Gresham-College</hi> why a Comet could not cause
the Deluge. But when I ask'd him farther, whether
he knew the Nature of that Hypothesis Mr. <hi>Halley</hi>
set up, and oppos'd: He told me he did not, so far
as to be able, to give me any manner of satisfaction;
but desir'd me to apply my self to Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> if I
had a mind to be farther inform'd about it. Which
to this day I have not done, and so could not possibly
make any use of any Notions he either propos'd, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
in this matter, as I am told some persons have
been willing to suggest, and which, if it had been so,
I should as freely own as I do all the other Hints and
Advantages I have had from any in this matter.
And I am under less temptation than another in this
case: for however remarkable I look upon several of
the Discoveries in the <hi>New Theory;</hi> yet I think the
Praise belonging to the Discoverer not so great as l<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>sser
Points, requiring a deeper Skill in the Author, may
justly deserve.</p>
            <p>The Case seems to me to be this. Tho' many Wise
men, with variety of Keys, belonging to other places,
should long puzzle themselves in vain in the opening
of a Door: and One of a worse character, who had
the good fortune to find the true one, should with ease
let them into the Closet; yet I think He, who upon
this should value himself, and expect a great degree
of Commendation, would thereby only demonstrate
that he deserv'd but a very little share of it. The
Application is easy; and tho' I perhaps do believe that
I have found a Key, and have open'd and explain'd
<pb facs="tcp:106675:7"/>
some Points of consequence, in the <hi>New Theory:</hi>
Yet as I heartily own and adore the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in all the Success of my Enquiries, so I, with
the before-mention'd Thoughts, am under little tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Envying any one their share in these Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
And I can safely say, that I have been more
than ordinarily cautious not to mention any thing,
which was the product even of my own Thoughts, if
I found that others had also took notice of it, without
making such mention of them as the Case did require:
And whatever Imputations I may otherwise deserve,
I have long since resolved to give no occasion that any
one should take me for a <hi>Plagiary.</hi>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO Mr. Keill's Remarks ON THE New Theory of the Earth.</head>
            <p>SINCE I perceive the Force of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
has had so great an Influence on
Mr. <hi>Keill,</hi> as to obtain his Allowance of
the Passing by of a Comet at the beginning of
the Deluge, which is the main Point I contend
for; and which once establish'd, the rest (as I
think I can still demonstrate) must, when fully
understood, be granted also; 'Tis a little sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
that he of all Men should in Publick
appear against me. And truly I am ready to
hope I have but few competent Judges besides
Mr. <hi>Keill,</hi> who, yielding me that main Point of
all, do yet reject my Account of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
of the Deluge; which are, I think, but natural
Consequents of such a Concession. But to let
that pass; this I am pretty secure of, that if
Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> were not more deeply engag'd against
my design by a peculiar fondness he seems to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106675:8"/>
have for the Introduction of unaccountable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
on all occasions, than by any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory
Objections against me; 'tis probable
he would rather privately have communicated
his Difficulties, and by Letter desir'd the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of them, than have taken this publick
Method of writing Remarks on the <hi>New Theory,</hi>
and leading it as it were in Triumph after the
Conquest he had been gaining over the <hi>Old one.</hi>
But not to expostulate this procedure with
Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> any farther; I must, before I come
to Particulars, <hi>both</hi> openly take notice of his
Civility and Fairness to me, in that he has
been pleas'd, amidst his somewhat severe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on the Mistakes of others, to deal with
me kindly and candidly even whilst he looks
upon me as guilty of not a few Errors in my
Reasoning;<note place="margin">Remarks, Pag. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>And</hi> at the same time faithfully
promise him, that I will cautiously avoid those
dis-ingenuous and studied Evasions which, as he
truly observes, are but too often made to pass
for Answers to the shrewdest Objections. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will I refuse at any time, on due convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to own my Mistakes; and as publickly to
retract my Errors, as I have publickly profess'd
them. But to wave any farther Preliminaries,
and to come to the Particular Objections.</p>
            <p>(1.) 'Tis alledg'd that my first Hypothesis,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 179, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>viz.
That a Chaos is the Atmosphere of a Comet,</hi>
can't be true, because the former is by all agreed to
have <hi>had Darkness on the face of its Abyss;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note>
whereas the latter is certainly a transparent Fluid;
and so has the Light, if not of its own Central Body
from within, yet at least of the Sun from without,
freely admitted into it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106675:8"/>
For Answer to which I affirm, That as to the
Central Solid, since a Comet is not capable of
a Change to a Planet or Earth till a long time
after its <hi>Perihelion,</hi> or indeed till 'tis return'd
from the vast and cold Regions beyond <hi>Saturn;</hi>
I wonder Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> should fear it would be not
too warm only, but so vehemently hot as to be
light also: Iron and other Solids will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
hot a long time after their Light or visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Fire is gone; and I don't imagin that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
descending to the Sun can be so much hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and brighter than such a cooling Ball of
Iron as to illuminate the Regions about them
for many hundred, if not thousand Miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
And then as to the Sun, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to shine through the Atmospheres of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
while they remain such, if Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> can
prove that the Words of <hi>Moses</hi> refer to the past
Ages, and not to the time of the commencing
of the Creation, to which principally if not
solely All Commentators I think refer them; it
will be to Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi> purpose: but if not, here
is no valid Objection against this part of the
<hi>New Theory.</hi> For as to the word <hi>Abyss,</hi> which
was once dark, and afterward enlightened, I see
no reason to restrain it at this time to the Dense
Fluid alone; (whither indeed the Light could
not penetrate after it was once intirely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
collected together below the Earth;)
But by it is, I think, in this place meant all that
heterogeneous and hitherto muddy Fluid which
was beneath the Earth's future Surface; or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
below that place where <hi>Adam</hi> was to
b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>

                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>l
Journal of the Creation is suppos'd to have
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>. And I believe there can be no reason
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106675:9"/>
to refuse this Interpretation, nor consequently
to create hence any difficulty against my Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
relating to this matter, What comes
to be next consider'd, is this:</p>
            <p>(2.) If we proceed Mechanically and Gradually
in the Formation of a Planet from a Comet's Atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere,<note place="margin">P. 182, &amp;c.</note>
we must allow the whole Subsidence to be as
leisurely, and to proceed by the same steps, that the
violence of its Heat decreases; which will then be
compleated not in six Days, or single Years, but scarcely
in as many Centuries; and the Opake parts will take
so much time in descending and composing the Crust
of Earth, that the Sun might always as freely almost
penetrate the <hi>Upper</hi> Regions of the Atmosphere at least,
if not farther, as it does the whole Atmospheres of
Comets while they are within our Observation.</p>
            <p>Now in Answer to this; which I own to be
an Argument of Good force, and to deserve
Consideration; I say, That if we found from
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Comets in their descent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sun, after their long Periods to cool
and settle in, since their last <hi>Perihelia;</hi> that they
had no Atmospheres, but that the Masses which
formerly compos'd 'em were subsided and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like the Surface of Planets, then indeed
this Reasoning were unavoidable: (Tho' even
in that case this would only enforce a still larger
Interpretation of the <hi>Days</hi> of Creation than I
allow, without any farther harm to the rest of
the <hi>Theory:</hi>) But seeing the contrary is evident
from Astronomical Observations, this cannot
affect my Hypothesis. It must indeed from
hence, I think, follow, that all the same Laws,
Properties, and Operations of Bodies which we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106675:9"/>
find establish'd here on Earth, do not so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
obtain in the Atmospheres of Comets:
which I confess the consideration of their <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
has always oblig'd me to believe, and
which any one who reads a Page or two may
easily see I was aware of when I wrote my
<hi>Theory.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Solut. 2.</note> The Introduction of the particular
Laws,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> Powers, and Properties of Bodies with
us, (that of Universal Gravity ever excepted;)
being in my Opinion there explain'd the Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
effect of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> who is said to
have <hi>moved on the face of the Waters</hi> at the very
beginning of the Mosaick Creation. And so
much I hope may suffice to shew the inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of this Argument; and that my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is no present Evasion of an emergent Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
but my setled Thoughts ever since I
wrote the <hi>New Theory.</hi> And the consideration
of this matter will afford a like Answer to
what is with some shew of Strength urg'd in
the next place,</p>
            <p>(3.) If the Sand, Stones, and Gravel of our Earth
were formerly in the Atmosphere of a Comet,<note place="margin">Pag. 184, 185.</note> which
is once in every Revolution prodigiously scorch'd by the
nearness of the Sun, they must formerly have been
melted, become transparent, and been turn'd into Glass;
because such is now the natural Effect of a violent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Heat with us in the like case. <hi>I answer:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, as we have just now observ'd, we
can't universally reason from the State and <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
of a Planet after its Formation, to the
<hi>Chaotick</hi> Condition it was in before. Tho' in
truth we do not need this Answer in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Case: For neither is it certain, that because
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106675:10"/>
such gross and compounded Bodies on Lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
become Glass, that therefore their first
elementary Atoms, or primary Dust, scatter'd
separately in the vastness of the Atmosphere,
would then have been subject to the same Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Nor if that were granted, does Mr. <hi>Keill</hi>
know that either our Earth, or the Comet that
came by at the Flood, was one of those which
approach so near the Sun, as that the Effects he
mentions must be unavoidable in them, tho'
they should be so in others, whose <hi>Perihelia</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them to the utmost degree of Scorching
imaginable. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>(4.) 'Tis Objected that there is no need of a
Central hot Solid to solve the Origin of Springs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 185, &amp;c:</note> and
such other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, they being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
accounted for by other means; nor if there were
a Central hot Solid, could its Heat be here sensible,
because the Heat of a very vehement Fire can't pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
a stone Wall of a few Feet in thickness.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Reality of an internal Heat,
below the influence of the Sun, in the Bowels
of the Earth, 'tis undeniable matter of fact, and
must be accounted for, whatever become of the
Origin of Springs, or the like <hi>Phaenomena;</hi> and
so it may be needful to admit a hot Central
Solid, even tho' such Effects as I with Dr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
am willing to ascribe to an Heat, should
be deducible from other causes. Tho' truly
I don't think that account Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> refers to
here of the Origin of Fountains so universal,
as to stand in no need of subterranean Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours:
For which, tho' I believe I can give good
reasons; yet I don't think it at all necessary at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106675:10"/>
present to engage in so long, and somewhat
foreign a Controversy. But then as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
of heat by a Wall of no great thickness,
'tis a very different case from our Earth: wh<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>re
the Heat ever ascending upwards, has first a Fluid
to heat; which when hot in one place, will
thereby be heated throughout; and after that,
has a crust of Earth, somewhat loosely put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and multitudes of <hi>Perpendicular Fissures</hi>
quite through it, with other pores and <hi>horizontal
Fissures,</hi> to permit the passage of the warm
Steams to the upper Regions. Besides all which,
the Heat is not merely deriv'd anew from the
Central Solid; but has been, by its means, ever
preserv'd since it self was deriv'd from the Sun
at the ancient <hi>Perihelia.</hi> All which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
do so much alter the case, that if
Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> had been aware of them, I hardly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he would have much insisted on this as a
mighty difficulty in my Book.</p>
            <p>We are now come to the principal doubt of
all,<note place="margin">P. 189.</note> which relates to my Interpretation of this
Fourth day's Work, so as to exclude the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Creation of the heavenly Bodies at
that time. Wherein Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> thinks I have
not exactly observ'd my own First <hi>Postulatum,</hi>
but receded from the Letter of the Scripture,
without sufficient Reasons for so doing. As to
which Point, I must still own that I am by no means
of Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi> mind; and since he only delivers
his opinion without producing his particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or enervating any of those I had so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given for what I asserted, I see no occasion
for a farther Vindication at present; and so shall
still leave that matter to the consideration of the
free and impartial Reader. However, since
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106675:11"/>
here occur some particular Difficulties, I shall
take notice of such of them as have not already
been consider'd.</p>
            <p>(5.) Tis objected,<note place="margin">Pag. 190, 191.</note> That because Comets have no
secondary Ones moving about them, the Moon, our
secondary Planet, must either have been really created,
or at least brought into our Neighbourhood on the fourth
Day; which being therefore the importance of the
word <hi>Made</hi> with relation to one, ought to be taken
in the same sense when referr'd to the other of the
heavenly Bodies: and so my Interpretation of this day's
work, which is built on other Principles, must be a
mistake.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' I might ask why the Moon might
not as well have come into our Neighbourhood
before, as just upon this day, in case she had
not of old been our Companion? Yet to put
this matter to another issue, I desire Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> to
prove that no Comets have any <hi>Satellites</hi> revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
about them. For my part, I think the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
we have yet made about Comets are
not nice nor numerous enough to determin this
Point. Nay rather, what the Histories of many
Comets relate about the various Shapes and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
they have sometimes appeared under,
seems to me hardly accountable, unless we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
lesser Comets to have been Companions to
the greater, and by their various Positions and
other circumstances to have occasion'd some at
least of that variety and strangeness in many of
their <hi>Phaenom<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> which not a few Accounts
confirm to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106675:11"/>(6.) 'Tis alledg'd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 191, &amp;c,</note> that before the Sun became vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
'tis not supposable that on the second Day of the
Creation his Heat could raise Vapors enow to fi<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>l the
Seas, Lakes, and Rivers in the primitive Earth; on
which yet my account of their Original is entirely built.</p>
            <p>Now not to examin the Computation which
Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> makes use of about the quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
rais'd and falling in a year, which I suppose
may be accurate enough: Nor to enquire how
little the Heat of the Sun may be diminish'd on
the Earth by so few Vapors collected together,
as may yet be sufficient to hide his Body from
our fight; I would ask Mr. <hi>Keill,</hi> What if the Sun
in half a year did not draw up Vapors enow to
make the thousandth part of the present Ocean?
What is this to me? who assert there was no
Ocean till the Deluge, nor no other than small
Seas and Lakes, perhaps not containing much
more than a thousandth part of the Water that
is now upon the Earth. And this is so visible
in my Book, that I prove there was before the
Flood no Ocean,<note place="margin">Solut. 7.</note> by this very reason,<note place="margin">Corol. 2.</note> That the
Sun could not draw up Vapors enow in half a
years time to compose so vast a collection of
Waters. Which if Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> had been pleas'd to
observe, he might have spar'd me the pains of
answering such an Objection.</p>
            <p>Having proceeded thus far in my own Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
I must now, according to my promise,
be so ingenuous as to own that much of Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi>
Reasoning against my Third Hypothesis of an
Only Annual motion of the Earth before the
Fall,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 193, &amp;c.</note> and so of a half year of Cold and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
together, (without a greater freedom of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106675:12"/>
thought than I expect in most Readers) taken
as 'tis at present laid down in my Book, is strong
and forcible, and unless I fly to such Evasions
as I have resolv'd against, not easily to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But then I must desire Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> to do me
so much Justice, as to remember that I told the
Reader I had somewhat farther to say in the
case; which might therefore, by a private en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
have been first understood before this
whole Proposition, of so great Importance, had
been absolutely rejected. My Words are these:
<q>This,<note place="margin">P. 102.</note> when rightly consider'd may save me
the labour of returning any other Answer to
the particular Difficulty here mention'd; and
of enlarging upon several other things which
might be said, to great satisfaction, on the
present occasion.</q> That upon this Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
therefore I may fully clear my Hypothesis
from this Obvious, Popular, and not inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Objection, I shall endeavour to set this
matter in a new and clear Light. And tho' I
do not my self see any plain <hi>Necessity</hi> of altering
any thing I have said on this Head; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have been long inclinable to think the
following Hypothesis very probable (as 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
very agreeable to the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the main Principles of my <hi>Theory</hi>) and
very likely to satisfy the difficulties of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Readers, I shall more fully explain my
thoughts in this case, and thereby shew that all
the Arguments that are levell'd against this
Branch of the <hi>New Theory</hi> are unconcluding.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding therefore I have already, and
do still assert that the <hi>Original Orbits</hi> of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
and particularly of the Earth were perfect
Circles; meaning by the <hi>Original Orbits,</hi> those
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106675:12"/>
in which they were to revolve immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were intirely form'd, and were to be
universally inhabited: Yet I must now add,
what I at first had some imperfect Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
that this Reduction of the very Oblong
and Eccentrical Orbit of our Earth whilst it was
a Comet, into a Uniform, Concentrical and
Circular one, which I suppose it had before the
Deluge, may justly be allow'd to have been
gradual, and not done at once: the greatest
part at the Commencing of the Mosaick Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the rest at the Commencing of the
Diurnal Rotation afterwards. (As indeed the
Diurnal Rotation could not Mechanically be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
I mean by the oblique Collision of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
but that the annual Orbit would thereby
be alter'd also.) Which being suppos'd; and
that Providence adjusted all circumstances so as
should be most to the advantage of Paradise;
We shall then have the Earth revolving in a
moderate <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> without any Diurnal Rotation
about the Sun in the Space of a Year: (Tho' the
<hi>exact</hi> length of that Year will not now be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable:)
A Day and a Year will be all one:
We shall have that <hi>Diameter</hi> of the Earth which
pass'd through Paradise, parallel to the longer
<hi>Axis</hi> of that <hi>Ellipsis</hi> it revolv'd in: And withal,
we shall have the place of Paradise, respecting
the same fixt Stars with the <hi>Perthelion</hi> of the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsis.</hi>
Which being suppos'd, as the Circular
Orbit is much the best for a Globe inhabited all
round, that providing equally for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of both Hemispheres; So is this <hi>Elliptick</hi>
Orbit the best for a Globe inhabited but in one
place, as the Earth was in the Primitive State;
this providing peculiarly for the happiness of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106675:13"/>
that particular Spot where alone the living part
of the Creation was to reside; as on considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will easily appear. Thus, for instance, the
heat of the day-time would gradually increase
before, and decrease after noon: but yet would
never be violent; because almost all the increase
of the Heat by the Sun's rising above the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
still higher and higher in the Forenoon or
Spring, would be prevented by his real receding
from the Earth, and approaching nearer his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegseon</hi>
during the same time; <hi>&amp; vice versÃ¢,</hi> in
the Afternoon or Summer: which would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the state of the Air more equable and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and less uneasy or inconvenient than any
other method whatsoever. Thus also not only
the Cold of the Night, (which by our then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nearest the Sun would be inconsiderable;)
but the Duration and Darkness thereof (two
very severe and frightful <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Hypothesis would be entirely avoided. For
the whole Night would then bear no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion

which will amount to no more than two
Months. Out of which Night-time, we must
deduct the two <hi>Crepuscula,</hi> each of about half a
Month, which reduces now the Darkness of
the Night to a single Month: Out of which
another half Month is to be still deducted for
the Moon's being above the Horizon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening
the Earth: So that at last, if the
Moon's <hi>Crepuscula</hi> be at all allow'd for, we shall
scarce have a single Week of pure Darkness in
the whole Year. Which Hypothesis does at
the first View so fully take off the popular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106675:13"/>
made against me; and affords so easy
and natural a Solution of the Difficulties urg'd
by Mr. <hi>Keill;</hi> besides its peculiar Fitness to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the primary Animals, and particularly our
first Parents happy, and their state to the utmost
degree Paradisiacal; that I shall add no more
in confirmation of it, but leave it to Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi>
and the Intelligent Readers own Consideration.
Only before I pass on, I cannot but take notice
of a great mistake of Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi> about the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Heat in the primitive Earth from my Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,
which he reckons some hundred of
times as great as in the present State: which I
am sure must be a plain Error, and all its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
which he from thence draws against
me, without any foundation. The Heat <hi>then,</hi>
for the light half year, being but the same quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Heat all at once; which <hi>now</hi> at times,
and with interruptions we are partakers of.
Which may deserve Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi> consideration and
correction.</p>
            <p>We are now come to the principal Part of my
<hi>Theory,</hi> the Account of the Deluge of <hi>Noah:</hi>
against which, 'tis objected by Mr. <hi>Keill,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(7.) That the Presence of a Comet,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 203, &amp;c.</note> tho' it would
cause considerable Tides in the Seas above, yet it could
not in the Abyss below the Earth: because this latter
is pent in, and closely shut up within a thick and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Crust of Earth, and has therefore no room to raise
it self as the Waters of the Seas have.</p>
            <p>Now in answer to this, I wonder how
Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> comes to imagin the Orb of Earth to
be so compact and solid a Sphere, as to be able
to overcome the great Impulse, which on the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106675:14"/>
Comet's approach the Abyss would make upon
it? In my Hypothesis, I am sure, it had only
the Consistence of adjoining Columns sinking
down together into the same Fluid, and that
extreamly broken, divided, and shatter'd at the
commencing of the <hi>Diurnal Rotation;</hi> when
great Numbers of Clefts and <hi>Fissures</hi> were every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
made through it, and the Orb by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence dispos'd to a division and separation
of Parts upon any considerable Impulse whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
One might almost as well assert, that a
Floor of disjoined Planks laid cross the <hi>Thames,</hi>
without any fastness on either side could sustain
the force of the Tide, and prevent its Ascent;
as that our Crust of Earth, so cleft and disjoined
as it was, should be able to sustain the force of
the Tide in the Abyss, and prevent its Ascent,
and those Effects which would be consequent
thereupon.</p>
            <p>(8.) 'Tis objected,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 104, &amp;c.</note> that the Expanded Vapors
deriv'd from the Comet, would, by passing through the
Air, and its resistence at their first descent, be all
turn'd into Water; and so, tho' this may at once drown
the World, yet it will not account for the long Rains
of forty Days, to which the Deluge of <hi>Noah</hi> was
principally owing.</p>
            <p>Now in answer to this I say, That tho' much
the greatest part of the Vapors should have been
at first turn'd into Water, and so continued, yet
'tis hard that Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> will not allow many of
them to escape the same; enow at least to make
a constant Rain for forty days together. I am
sure 'tis to me strange, that so thin a Body as
our Air, lying in so small a compass about the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106675:14"/>
Earth, as the height of not very many Miles
(for much higher 'tis so very thin as to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
inconsiderable) should have the good luck
to stop, arrest, and condense all and every part of
so immense and swift a descending Column
of Vapors as we have here to be consider'd. But
besides, (not to question whether Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi>
method of reducing Vapors into Rain-water be
universal or not:) Let it be granted that these
hot Vapors were at their first descent forc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
yet till that quantity of Heat which
caus'd and continued their degree of Expansion
in the Comet's Atmosphere or Tail were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
diminish'd, and they become as cool as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors
turning into Water with us, till then I say,
whatsoever their first violent Motion might on
the sudden produce, yet their own proper Heat
would immediately rarify 'em again, and so
elevate 'em to a proportionable height in the
Air, and capacitate them to produce that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
forty days Rain, which appears to have
had so great a share in the Universal Deluge.</p>
            <p>(9.) 'Tis objected,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P</hi> 207, &amp;c.</note> That tho' a persorated Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Stone or Marble, pressing upon Water in an
exactly equal Cylindrical Vessel under it, would thereby
force it, or any lighter Fluid on its Surface through
the holes upwards; yet the Pressure of the Additional
Waters upon the Crust of Earth could not cause the
Eruption of the <hi>Dense Fluid,</hi> or of any Waters lying
upon it in the Bowels of the Earth, on several accounts;
particularly because in the first ase the Cylinder is
specifically heavier than Water, but in the second the
Orb of Earth is lighter than the Dense Fluid under it:
which Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> supposes does wholly alter the case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106675:15"/>
Now in answer to this I say, If Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it,
I will put a Cylinder of Wood, which
is lighter than Water, instead of one of Stone
or Marble which is heavier; and I do not
doubt of the truth of the Experiment in this
case, if that will afford him satisfaction. But
indeed I perceive by all Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi> Reasoning
here, that he mistakes my Notion; and that
'tis but setting him right in this, and all his
difficulties will vanish of their own accord. I
say then, and I am sure Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
it, that a lighter Solid will as truly
press a Fluid heavier than it self, till it is
sunk so deep as the known Law of <hi>Hydrosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
requires, as a solid that is Specifically
heavier: And if by its closeness of texture,
and want of room about it, it be hindred from
really descending so far, it will continually press
the Fluid, and force it upwards, or any way
where there are any Holes and Fissures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an equal degree of pressure upon them.
And this certainly is the present Case. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Columns of Earth at the beginning
were 200 Miles in Depth in the whole, and
taken together but half so Dense as the Fluid
on which they rely'd; Then at the Mosaick
Creation, when the <hi>Strata</hi> of the Columns
were not yet consolidated, but every where
previous to the Fluid, the several Columns
would, as Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> well knows, sink 100 Miles
into the Fluid, and the other 100 Miles would
be extant above it. If now after the Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidation
of the <hi>Strata,</hi> when the Orb can't sink
freely as before, a New addition be made at
the top of each Column (whether of lighter
or heavier matter 'tis all one) equal in weight
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106675:15"/>
to two Miles of the same Column; which is
just the case of the Deluge: In this state 'tis
evident that the pressure of two intire Miles
of each Column, being so prodigiously great,
must squeeze the Fluid upward through the
Fissures (which were just open'd, and fill'd
with Water to the height of perhaps 60 or 70
Miles, from the Neighbouring Earth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
with the same) and thereby throw
out the incumbent Water, and perhaps it
self upon the Face of the Earth. And
this the more easily, because the pressure was
from the Water, which would lie chiefly in the
Valleys, whilst the Fissures were mostly in the
Mountains, and so above the Surface of the
Cortex; which otherwise by running into them,
would a little stop the upward current, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
the motion of the ascending Waters.
Which things being, I think, undeniably true,
and plainly express'd in my Book, I must be a
little surpriz'd that one so well Vers'd in <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staticks</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Keill,</hi> should be so perplex'd in
this matter. All Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi> Demonstrations sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
either that not the Water on the Earth, but
in the Fissures did contribute to raising the Fluid
through them; which I could not be so childish
as to imagine. Or that the several Columns of
Earth had free liberty, and could subside as far
as occasion should be; which I have in my Book,
as well as here, shew'd they could not. Or that
a pressure from a Column specifically heavier
than the Fluid is necessary to raise it upward;
when 'tis evidently all one, though it be lighter.
So that upon the whole, I think Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> might
have spar'd those peremptory words which he
uses in this point. <q>From all this it is <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106675:16"/>
evident, that by no sort of pressure
of the Incumbent Fluid, the Abyss could be
forced upwards to spread it self on the Surface
of the Earth.</q>
               <note place="margin">Remarks, P. 215.</note> Which I hope on farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
he will think fit to retract.</p>
            <p>(10.) 'Tis Objected,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 215, &amp;c.</note> That whereas I derive at
least half the Waters of the Deluge from the Bowels
of the Earth, this is impossible; because there can be
no Sphere or Collection of Waters between the Earth
and the dense Fluid, which is the only place besides, in
Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi> Opinion, the Fissures themselves, capable
of containing the same.</p>
            <p>In Answer whereto I cannot but say 'tis
strange Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> should look for Subterraneous
Waters every where else but where I always
plac'd 'em; in the pores and cavities of all the
lower Earth. And I imagine Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> himself
will not deny that 60 or 70 Miles together of
the inward Earth, satur'd and full with Water,
might afford much more than we have occasion
for at the Deluge; and so might easily supply
the Fissures, in a constant drein for 5 Months
together, with enough to go more than half
way in the laying the Surface of the whole
Earth under Water. However, since we know
not, nor did I ever directly assign, in what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
the two several causes of the Deluge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
their shares thereto; my <hi>Theory</hi> is not
concern'd, though no more Water was thrown
out upon the Earth than fill'd the Fissures, as
high as the Earth was satur'd with Water at the
Mosaick Creation: which Quantity even Mr. <hi>Keill</hi>
seems not unwilling to allow me. As to the
Dense Fluid it self, and whether the force were
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106675:16"/>
great enough any where to cast any quantity
thereof out upon the Earth, I know not how
to determine. Though so far I am sure, that
vast quantities of it might have been on the
Earth without any of its appearing now above
ground; which is Mr. <hi>Keill's</hi> Objection in this
case. For unless there was more than Satur'd,
and perhaps Consolidated with, the Sediment
of the Waters (which now, as Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> will
grant, composes at least two or three hundred
Feet thickness of our present Earth:) I am sure
we are not, (on account of their mighty gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
bearing 'em to the bottom of the whole
Fluid,) to expect any remains of it in the Seas
or Ocean, no nor in any Pits, Holes, or
Valleys upon the present Earth.</p>
            <p>And here Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> is so kind as to afford me
a breathing time, and to grant so many of my
solutions to be right at once; namely all those
relating to Dr. <hi>Woodward's</hi> Essay,<note place="margin">P. 217.</note> and the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Deluge; that I cannot but own
my real Joy on this occasion: That the force
of my reasoning should here prove so strong as
to satisfy even Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> (who seems so little to
acquiesce in many other of my Arguments) in
that intire point, of which I must grant my self,
from any enquiries of my own, to be the least
Master, of all other in my Book. And truly
I must say that I think Mr. <hi>Keill,</hi> by confessing
that I have convincingly enough prov'd that a
Comet pass'd by the Earth at the Deluge; and
that All Dr. <hi>Woodward's Phaenomena</hi> are rightly
accounted for by that easy Hypothesis I took
concerning them; By these concessions, I say,
I believe Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> has done more to establish
my Book, than all his Objections will avail to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106675:17"/>
reject it: And himself is therefore much more
my Friend and Patron than he ever intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have been by these Remarks on my
<hi>Theory.</hi> But to leave this Digression, and proceed
to the.</p>
            <p>(11.) And Last Objection;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 221, &amp;c.</note> which is this, That
though I can easily fetch as much Water as I have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for upon the Earth to drown it; yet I have
no way to get handsomly rid of it again; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
my solutions of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Deluge come to nothing, and all at last must be
resolv'd into Miracle.</p>
            <p>Now how it has come to pass that this drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off the Waters of the Deluge has been so
much stuck at, I cannot tell: The thing it self
having, I think, no difficulty in it. Certainly
the pores and interstices of 30 or 40. Miles of
dry Earth are capable of receiving 3 or 4 Miles
of Water into 'em: and certainly the same
Fissures which permitted the ascent of the Fluids
from beneath before, would after the ceasing of
that force permit the descent of the Waters of
the Deluge; and by degrees in length of time
draw them off, and so leave the Earth as it now
appears to us. For what is in the <hi>perpendicular
Fissures</hi> will sideways run into, and saturate, by
the <hi>Horizontal Fissures</hi> and other passages, all the
Neighbouring Earth: which if Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> doubts
of, let him but make a hole in the Earth, and
fill it with Water, and see whether he do not
perceive the Neighbouring parts to be moistened,
and the hole to be soon empty enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a new supply; notwithstanding there be
no subterraneous Cavern ready to receive it:
which easy experiment may go a great way to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106675:17"/>
convince Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> that the removing the Waters
of the Deluge is no such insuperable <hi>Problem,</hi> as
he seems to suppose it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have gone through the whole Body of
the Reflections made by Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> on my <hi>New
Theory:</hi> and hope I have observ'd the Rules
which at his desire I at first set my self in this
Reply: And all that I, in my turn, shall claim
of him, in case he think sit to make any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joinder,
is this, That he would be careful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to observe the same Rules himself, which he
expected from me; and be as ready to own any
satisfaction I may have given him in any points,
as to reinforce those Objections he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not yet be satisfied about. And as I shall
willingly correct any occasional mistakes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in other points, or in the Mathematicks of
my Book (a few of which, tho' of no ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to the <hi>Theory</hi> it self, I am conscious of)
if it ever come to a Second Edition; So in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thereto I shall heartily thank Mr. <hi>Keill,</hi> or
any body else, who shall be so kind as by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to inform me of any of them.</p>
            <p>I have now done with Mr. <hi>Keill's Remarks on my
Theory,</hi> and before we part, I shall only desire
him to answer plainly to a question or two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the matter now in debate between us,
and shall then take my leave.</p>
            <p>(I.) Since Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> grants that a Comet
pass'd by at the Deluge, and yet contends that
the Flood is not to be solv'd therefrom, but is
to be believ'd wholly miraculous; To what
purpose did the Comet so providentially pass
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106675:18"/>
by just at that time if it had no relation to the
Deluge? Does Mr. <hi>Keill</hi> imagine, That the
same miraculous power which caus'd the Deluge
could not also, without the attraction of a
Comet, make the Earth's Orbit <hi>Elliptical?</hi> A
strange, unheard of, and most surprizing <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi>
happens in the World! A Blazing Star,
which we but seldom discover at a vast distance
in the Heavens, descends hard by the body of
our Earth: which without the greatest exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Chain of Providence does not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in thousands, nay millions of years: and
as soon as ever 'tis pass'd by, a wonderful, and
incredible Deluge of Waters overflows the
whole Earth, and drowns all its Inhabitants
without any other visible or imaginable occasion
in the World: and yet, as it seems, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
only accidentally pass'd by, and had no
hand at all in the Deluge!â€” <hi>Credat Iudaeus
Apella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) How could those effects I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
be avoided upon the passing by of the
Comet? We are not now in a <hi>Cartesian Vortex,</hi>
where fancy and contrivance can introduce or
hinder any effect at pleasure: But we are in
Mechanical and Experimental Philosophy, which
is an inflexible thing, and not at all subject to
our inclinations. When the Comet therefore
was just pass'd by us, I desire to know how the
Earth could possibly avoid passing through its
Atmosphere and Tail? If it could not, Pray
what could prevent the acquiring that Column
of Vapours I, by computation, find would fall
on its Surface? And if such a Column of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
was left on the Earth, what could hinder
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106675:18"/>
their becoming Water, and drowning the Earth?
I shall not, though I easily might, carry on the
Chain of Queries any longer. But if Mr. <hi>Keill</hi>
can fairly Answer me these few leading Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
I shall then believe him alike able to
Answer the rest, and so I shall not pursue this
particular any farther, but leave it and this
whole matter to his and the Reader's leisure
and consideration.</p>

fairness and justness of my proposal of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;

many <hi>insuperable difficulties</hi> which have been urg'd
against the Forming of our present upper Earth from

            <p>In answer whereto; for (to say nothing that
the non-appearance of any Towns, Cities, Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
or other Remains of the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> World,
is <hi>next to a demonstration</hi> on my side;) I must
own that I was so incapable of overcoming
those <hi>insuperable difficul<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>i<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> that I knew nothing
of them: and I did not in the least think, that
what I of my self suppos'd concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Subsiding of that Sediment, and without
any <hi>prior</hi> Dissolution of the Old Earth, its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
a new Crust upon it, had been once hit
upon by any one else before me. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be such <hi>insuperable difficulties,</hi> as to the
main strokes of that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> I ought not to
pretend Skill enough in the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the
inner Earth positively to determin. Dr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward's</hi>
larger Work ought to be publish'd before
one can venture to pronounce too dogmatically
in that Point. As to my self, I see hitherto no
reason to change my Belief therein, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the confidence of this Author. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
difficulties may appear at the first sight,
(arising, it may be, from a misunderstanding of
several particulars relating thereto, and of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
circumstances therein to be consider'd,) yet
those numerous Shells, Bones, Trees, Plants, and
other Bodies found in so many places in the
Bowels of our present Earth, to say nothing of
what was urg'd before, or might be from other
arguments, are to me so convincing, that 'tis
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106675:19"/>
not a few <hi>difficulties,</hi> nay scarce less than a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi>
will persuade me to the contrary. If
the non-observation sometimes of the Law of
Specifick Gravity, and the consequent irregular
Position of the <hi>Strata,</hi> be the main Objection in
the case, as it seems, by this Author, to be, I
had observ'd and accounted for the same alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the <hi>New Theory.</hi> And certainly if the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
disposition of Bodies in such a <hi>Chaotick</hi>
Sediment,<note place="margin">Phaenom. 83.</note> with the as irregular Tempests and
Commotions of the Waters, and the consequent
removal of several Masses either setled or setling
down from one place to another, by which the
Order, Crassitude, and Position of the <hi>Strata</hi>
must have been strangely diversified, together
with all the other circumstances of the Old
Earth, and of the Deluge, be consider'd, 'twill
not be so strange, that the irregular Position of
the <hi>Strata,</hi> subsiding all the while according to
their several Specifick Gravities, was disturb'd
and interrupted without being oblig'd to reject
such an intire <hi>Hypothesis</hi> on account hereof. It
will however (that I say something to what is
here observ'd from the Learned Dr. <hi>Lister</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be consider'd, whether some of those
Subterranean places, where such mighty sholes
of Shells are heap'd together, be as proper for
their production as those Cavities in Animals
where 'tis said some have been found, (to say
nothing of Knives, Nails, and other things some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
found in the Bodies of Animals, which
Nobody imagins to have grown there;) at least
those Trees, methinks, which are found buried
so deep in the Earth, will give some foundation
for that <hi>Hypothesis</hi> I here defend: there having
been no instances of such productions, I suppose,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106675:20"/>
in Animals;<note place="margin">Pag. 85.</note> and this Author himself, or rather
his Namesake, in a good humour being willing
to allow them as Reliques of the Deluge, how
much soever at another time he seems dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in that point.</p>
            <p>But however that matter shall be determin'd,
the main and principal Parts of the <hi>New Theory,</hi>
and those in which I look upon my self as most
nearly concern'd, are not very much interested
therein. Those who, with this Author here,
suppose the Subterranean Shell-Bones, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,
to have grown originally there where
they are now found, may suppose the Waters
of the Deluge to have been indifferent pure,
and that their Sediment by consequence was less
considerable; and may then omit so many of
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> and their <hi>Solutions</hi> in the <hi>New
Theory</hi> as refer to the other Opinion, and the
rest will, I hope, afford them still all reasonable
satisfaction. Nay farther, Altho' any, with
Dr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> should see reason to insist upon
the Dissolution of the Old Earth, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settlement
of the same again at the Deluge,
They will yet, I am pretty sure, be unable to
account for the greatest Number, and those the
principal <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of that Deluge, without that
passing by of the Comet, which if I mistake not,
I have next to demonstrated in the <hi>New Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
and upon which the main Reasonings of
that Book, with relation to the Deluge, are
founded. And tho' what Arguments these may
urge, should make it reasonable to add some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to, or alter somewhat in the particulars
in the <hi>New Theory</hi> relating to the Sediments of
the Flood, yet I think they must be far from
affecting the principal parts of that Book. In
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106675:20"/>
case my Calculations and Deductions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Commencing of the Earth's Diurnal
Rotation at the Fall, and the passage of the
Comet at the Deluge, with their Consequences,
hold true, (and I have met with nothing hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
to he opposed to 'em,) I shall go near to
leave the other coincident Point of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean
Bodies to such as are more capable
Judges of those matters, and freely give them
leave to believe what they shall have good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for in that case; tho' at the same time
I must needs profess, that the Arguments for
what I have asserted, even on that Head, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to me so cogent, that as hitherto I have
not, so I do not hereafter much expect to meet
with Reasons sufficient to alter my opinion
therein.</p>
            <p>But here, before I proceed, give me leave to
vindicate my self from an Aspersion thrown on
me by the Author of this last Objection; <hi>viz.</hi>
The Quoting Dr. <hi>Woodward's Essay</hi> for several
Observations, which 'tis said he was not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Author of, and depriving thereby the first
discoverers of their deserved commendations.
Now if this be so, and those things which I
have cited out of that <hi>Essay</hi> be owing to the
Pains of others, and not his own, (tho' I am
not satisfied how that matter stands, nor am
ready to believe the Doctor so great a Plagiary
as some would make us believe,) I sincerely
profess that I was wholly ignorant of it; and
if any thing of that nature have been done, the
Author of that <hi>Essay,</hi> not of the <hi>New Theory,</hi> is
accountable for it. I neither am, nor pretend
to be Master of much Skill in the History of
Learning, or the natural History of the Earth:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106675:21"/>
and this Author very rightly takes notice, that <hi>I
have not shewn a profound or clear knowledge in those
matters</hi> (which yet methinks might have been
more easily excus'd in a <hi>young</hi> (however <hi>thoughtful</hi>)
<hi>Divine,</hi> as I am stil'd a little before.) My own
Studies and Inclinations, to say nothing of some
other circumstances, have lain somewhat ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way: and I do not know any obligation
upon me, <hi>invitÃ¢ MinervÃ¢,</hi> to force my self into
them. I did therefore, I think, what Prudence
dictated in the case; where my own Stock fail'd,
I had recourse to the more Skilful; particularly
to Dr. <hi>Burnet's</hi> Enquiries as to the Ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and Doctrines of the Philosophers; and
to Dr. <hi>Woodward's Essay,</hi> just then made publick,
as to the present <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Earth. Both
of them, in their several kinds, had methought
extraordinarily perform'd their parts, so far as I
had occasion to make use of them; and Both of
them being Extant before any of my own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were known to others, or almost disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by myself, I thought, whatever partiality
they could possibly be suspected of, with regard
to <hi>their own</hi> several <hi>Hypotheses;</hi> yet with regard
to <hi>mine</hi> their attestation could not but be deem'd
valid and unprejudic'd, and so not unfit for me
in those circumstances to rely upon. When
therefore I observ'd that almost all which was
matter of Ancient Tradition, or of fact; almost
all that agreed with Scripture, and requir'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
immechanical or miraculous in 'em both,
did easily fall in with my own Notions, and
Calculations; In particular, when I observ'd
that the Waters of the Deluge, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Bodies, would naturally arrive at that
very state <hi>without,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> thought
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106675:21"/>
his <hi>Phaenomena</hi> forc'd him to bring 'em to <hi>with</hi>
his own strange <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Dissolution of
the Old Earth: and that consequently what Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
he had for <hi>his own,</hi> would in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
be stronger on the side of <hi>my Hypothesis;</hi> I
made no farther delay or enquiry, but set down
things from those Authors (whom I almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
had opportunity to consult, and whom
accordingly I every-where quote in the Margin)
as they now stand in the <hi>New Theory.</hi> This is
a true and fair account of the matter, and such
as I hope (whatever it do as to the weakening
the Opinion of my <hi>abilities,</hi> which I shall not
endeavour to raise beyond the truth) will free
me from any just Imputation of <hi>design,</hi> or <hi>disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
to any: of which I am not in the least
conscious to my self, and of which I think I
have not given any Indications in the <hi>New
Theory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, as to what this Author in the last
place is pleas'd to repeat again, notwithstanding
his <hi>discovery of a noble Genius in the Formation of
my System, and his unwillingness to accuse me of any
ungenerous dealing</hi> concerning my ascribing the
Observations of other Eminent Philosophers to

               </note>
That my Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Account of the Deluge implies it was no divine
Iudgment for the World's Wickedness; but from the
Necessity of the Motion of the Comet and Earth, must
have happen'd whether Men had repented or not;
and so induces a <hi>rigid fatality:</hi> And withal 'tis said,
That tho' <hi>Miracles,</hi> i. e. a violent perturbation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Laws, be not usual; yet a <hi>Providential Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
in particular Events is, and must be own'd
to be so; or else the Foundation of Devotion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is gone.</p>
            <p>Now as to a <hi>rigid Fatality.</hi> 'Tis strange my
<hi>Theory</hi> should be built on it, when I'm sure I
never imagin'd such a thing, nor in my opinion
or practice at all differ from other Christians in
those things relating thereto. I believe the same
as to the Success of Prayer, the Interest of the
Divine Providence, and the Deluge's being a
proper Effect thereof, as any other Christian
does: And were not this Objector so hot, and
engag'd in the Point, methinks all this is visible
in my Book. Now the Original of this Man's
mistake is the same, as is the Original of their
mistake in the arguing against the Liberty of
Will, from the Certainty of the Divine Prescience,
and of Prophecy depending thereon: and when
you have rightly consider'd the latter, I imagin
you will easily rectify your mistake in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Case. You say the Flood would have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
whether Men had been Wicked or not,
because the Comet was approaching. Let me
argue in the other case: The Flood would as
certainly have happen'd however, from the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the Divine Prescience which foresaw
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106675:22"/>
it. If you answer, The Divine Prescience fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
the Sins as well as the Punishment: So say
I, It foresaw the Sins, and therefore Originally
dispos'd the Comet's Course for the Punishment:
which if Men had amended, would have been
foreseen, and so the Comet otherwise dispos'd
of at first. And certainly the same Answers
every-where will serve in my Case, which can
be alledg'd in the other, on which mine wholly
depends. And truly I was so fully sati<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ed in
Dr. <hi>Barnet</hi>'s Answer in this Case formerly (and
observe Mr. <hi>Warren</hi> to have so little to say to it
in his <hi>Geologia,</hi> P. 126.) that I usually thought
those who could not clear this Point to their
own Minds, not capable of Philosophick Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
This Objector does well distinguish the
<hi>particular Interposition</hi> of Providence from a <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
and says our Prayers depend on the former.
It may be so, for ought that I am sure of to the
contrary; and however, 'tis best to suppose it in
our Devotions, as I always do, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
always does. But seeing the other Notion
is equally suitable to Religion, comes to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same at last, and will be of vast use in case of
the other parts of Nature yet to be discover'd, be
found reducible to as fixt Laws as those we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
know, certainly are; as giving a clear
account of the Consistency of a setled Course of
Nature, with the constant Interposition of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in the World. I confess I am pretty
confident of the Truth, as well as fully satisfied
of the Use of my Account of these matters.
My own Reputation may be blasted among
some w<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>n Persons (tho' I find few competent
Judges slick at this point) by my maintaining
this Opinion: But I fear Religion among the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106675:23"/>
               <hi>Deists</hi> will suffer more without it. Those who
are angry at me, believe the Bible, and so will
not be hurt, but only displeas'd at my Notion.
But those who finding Nature constant, know
not how to bring in, or believe a Providence,
will be really hurt without such an account as I
have given; and where only my own Interest
is on one side, and that of Religion on the other,
I think I can cheerfully submit to some degrees
of Popular Odium, if it should be my hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to incur it, without any reason: which yet
the reception I have generally met with, gives
me no reason to expect.</p>
            <p>(14.) 'Tis alledg'd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Nichols.</note>
That by turning the <hi>days</hi> of
Creation into <hi>years,</hi> I am too bold, and not very
consistent with my own Hypothesis; that neither the
sacred Stile, where days are so often us'd for years,
implies any thing; because those words of time are in
all Languages us'd indifferently: nor the Profane Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,
because they seem no more to countenance
my Hypothesis than Dr. <hi>Burnet's;</hi> and in truth were
only unintelligible Paradoxes coin'd, as usual, in those
Ages; and of which many more might be brought
to support other fancies; or at best were but explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the perpetual Spring, which was a fancy of
the Poets for the Golden Ages.</p>
            <p>But sure this is too loose arguing to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to all the positive Evidence I have alledg'd
in this case. I can demonstrate to none but
such as grant all my <hi>Postulata,</hi> the 3d of which
is here set aside; and if any think 'em preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
they must look for better satisfaction in
other Authors. But however, I do not turn
<hi>days</hi> into <hi>years;</hi> but deny their distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106675:23"/>
the Fall: And in truth the Vulgar Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ought as well to prove that their days then
were of the present length; as I that they were
equal to years; since there is no particular inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in the Words how long they were;
nay, whoever considers, what will I hope e're
long be demonstrated, that <hi>days</hi> are only in two
places of the Scripture denominated by <hi>Evening
Mornings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 14. 26.</note>
the one here, and the other in <hi>Daniel;</hi>
and that 'tis evident in the latter they signify
years,<note place="margin">N. T. P. 84.</note> will not be averse from believing the
former to denote the same also. Besides, I have
already deny'd that all words of time are us'd
wholly promiscuously in Scripture; and am
confident the contrary is not to be prov'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.
But as to the prophane Testimonies; those
who can give a rational account of 'em, will
never slight 'em. And whatever is here in the
general said, I refer my self to the considering
Reader whether I have not demonstrated those
Ancient Philosophers to agree better to mine
than to Dr. <hi>Burnet's</hi> Hypothesis. But instead of
a farther Answer here, I shall add another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the same nature, which since my
Book was publish'd was discover'd by a Friend,
and communicated to me: which I must own to
be a much more remarkable Testimony than any
of those I formerly insisted on; which therefore I
shall recommend to the Reader's consideration;
and 'tis this; 'Twas the Assertion of <hi>Empedocles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. Plut. de Plac.</note>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106675:24"/>
to the day time alone, I mean the space of the
Sun's being above the Horizon, (which is a
common acceptation of the Word <hi>Day,</hi>) accords
so exactly with my Hypothesis, as it stands at
present, that nothing can do more so: and
coming so late, so unexpected, and yet so intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
home to our point, is justly, I think,
to be look'd on as decretory in the present
case.</p>
            <p>(15.) 'Tis said I have not ground enough to
suppose a double course of Rain at the Deluge.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Nichols.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is a matter of small consequence; for
as I with others think the double course much
the most agreeable to the Sacred History, and
have accordingly accounted for it; so in case it
were not so, no great harm would accrue to the
rest of my <hi>Theory:</hi> for as, if the Comet's Orb
was exactly in the plain of the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> the
Earth would fall a second time into it, unless
its Tail was very short; so if either of those
circumstances were otherwise, which we can
only determine from the effects, there could be
no second course of Rain upon my Hypothesis.
All which is said more with regard to others no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
than my own: for I confess I see no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of reason to recede in this point from what
I have said already in the <hi>New Theory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(16.) 'Tis said that by supposing Seas without
Clouds before the Flood I contradict the known <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
of nature:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Nichols.</note> for when Vapors and Steams are

do at present.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:106675:24"/>
But sure this is too hasty a Conclusion: and
if the Moon has Seas, as is generally allow'd,
'tis contrary to the known appearances of that
Planet: to say nothing of any of the others.
And certainly the long spaces at some times,
and in some Regions, which are without Clouds,
even in our present state of things, when yet
vast quantities of Vapors continue in the Air,
are sufficient Answers to this Argument. 'Tis,
I think, the Wind, and the irregular Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and descent of the superior and inferior
Vapors which occasion those thick Masses in the
Air we call Clouds, and those showers conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
thereupon, and not any thing belonging
to the Antediluvian Earth.</p>
            <p>(17.) 'Tis Objected, with great shew of accuracy,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Nichols,</note>
that in 40 days or 96 day, but a very small quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Vapors 4000 times as rare as our Air could
descend; within which spaces yet the Rains at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
must be confin'd: for as Vapors now condense
and fall about a mile in six hours, when they compose
the dew; so vapours 4000 times rarer would be
4000 times as long before they would descend; so
that every Mile of the Comet's Vapor (at least that
of the Tail) must be 1000 days, or almost 3 years in
condensing into rain; and so by consequence 750000
Miles of this Vapor must be almost three times 750000
years before it be all condens'd and fallen upon the
Earth.</p>
            <p>Now in Answer to this I say, Here is a gross
mistake, that every Mile of the Comet's Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors
must have a distinct time of condensing,
and descending. As they all fell at once upon
the Earth at first, so those of the same degree of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106675:25"/>
rareness would generally be condens'd and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
at once upon the Earth in rain afterwards.
And as the Vapors, being of several degrees of
rareness, and subject to various chances, would
successively descend and cause continual Rains;
so I think the spaces of 40 and of 96 days, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to confine the last of 'em respectively.
The Altitude, and where the Air is 4000 times
as rare as with us, and whence, by consequence,
the highest would descend from, is not so many
Miles as one would imagine, (as the <hi>Torricellian
Tube,</hi> by its different height, at the foot and top
of Mountains assures us) nor indeed any other
than very well agrees with the 40 and 96 days
of descent, which are necessary in the present
case, as on a fair Calculation, will, I believe,
easily appear; tho' 'tis so impossible to state all
the points relating to this matter very nicely,
that I think it hardly worth while to set about
it, since the general consideration hereof does so
wholly take off the force of the present
Objection.</p>
            <p>(18.) 'Tis said that because the bodies of Comets
appear much less in their <hi>Perihelia</hi> than before,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Nichols.</note>
'tis
probable their Tales are Smoak, and not Vapor; and
that the Earth of the Comets was by the Sun's heat
evaporated, and composed the Tail.</p>
            <p>Now truly this is to me News, that the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Body of a Comet grows much less at the
<hi>Perihelion.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> becomes
somewhat less at that time; which is a natural
effect of the rarefaction of part of it into the
Tail. But Smoak is an Earthly Substance, not
to be rarifi'd or elevated in any proportion with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106675:25"/>
Vapors; and indeed when I see showers of Dust
or Smoak as common as those of Rain, I may
be tempted to doubt of this point, but hardly
before; especially if we regard the Tail in its
descent from the cold Regions, which must
certainly be Vapor, till the violence of the heat
in the Perihelion doth mix other Earthly Bodies
therewith. Tho' if much Smoak were among
the Vapors, I see not what great harm would
ensue to my Hypothesis thereby.</p>
            <p>(19.) 'Tis said <hi>Noah</hi> and the Ark must have
been scorch'd or burnt by the heat of the Comet and
its Atmosphere,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Nichols.</note>
if they came as near as my Hypothesis
requires.</p>
            <p>To omit here the place of <hi>Noah</hi> and the Ark,
(In that Hemisphere of the Earth which escap'd
the primary descent of the Vapors; and so let
'em have been never so hot, would be cool'd
e're they became Rain:) I pray what harm could
a Comet, tho' 10 times as hot as the Earth
(which yet is too great a heat in the descent to
the Sun) at the distance of at least 30000 miles,
do to it? For tho' the Comet which Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>
mentions were heated prodigiously, and would
not cool in a very long time; yet this revolving
in such an Orbit as my Figure supposes, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
but the 60th part of the heat, and revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
if the Trajectories were similar, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
20 times the period of the other, is not liable
to the same computations; or ought to occasion
the same difficulties; which if the other had
come by in its room might justly have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
against me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:106675:26"/>
(20.) 'Tis Objected,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> B.</note>
with great shew of strength,
that the different attractions of the Earth and Moon
must separate 'em farther than before, and thereby at
once alter the species of the Orbit of the Moon, and
its periodical time also; on the continuance of which
last so much depends; for at the Comets approach it
would, before it came at either of 'em, draw 'em
asunder and accelerate 'em differently, and after it
was past 'em, it would do the same; by reason of
the different distances of the one and the other to
the Comet; and by reason of the proportional at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of the one commencing before that of the other.</p>
            <p>In Answer to this difficulty, which deserves a
careful consideration, I deny that any such ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricity,
or difference of periodical time in
the Moon would follow: For as the accelerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Earth commenc'd before that of the
Moon, so also did its retardation; and as while
the Comet was above or below 'em both, it
would separate them; so while it was between
'em it would draw 'em together. Besides, in
general I demonstrate the whole thing thus:
The Earth and the Moon had equal velocity,
and a right position before: And the velocity
and position were equally increas'd, or affected
alike by the Comet, (as from the like position
of these two Bodies in a System revolving about
their Common Center of Gravity, and from
the equal approach and acceleration of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
to 'em both is plain.) And consequently
their old Position and common Revolutions
would still remain. So that when the Moon's
Eccentricity could be no other way caus'd by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106675:26"/>
the Comet than I conjectur'd,<note place="margin">P. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

in which the
Period of the Moon would still be preserv'd, all
these fears may be at an end. Tho' I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
thank this Objector for putting me upon
clearing so substantial a point; in which the
main of the <hi>New Theory</hi> was so deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.</p>
            <p>(21.) That our Earth should have been once a
Comet seems not probable,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> B.</note>
because in all past Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
no other Comet has been observ'd to stop and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Planet; which one would imagine should
now and then have happen'd since the Mosaick
Creation.</p>
            <p>For Answer to which I say, That as the Earth
is inconsiderable in comparison of the Universe
or the Solar System; so I believe is 6000 or 7000
years, (the Period I suppose of its duration)
[much more about 2000 years the reach of our
Astronomical Histories] to the Duration of
the whole System. So that tho' we have no
other Example of an Earth form'd from a
Comet, yet this is no great difficulty in the
Case. I believe Worlds are not form'd every
Age, nor perhaps every thousandth Age nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>(22.) Why should not the Comet,<note place="margin">

to which I
ascribe the Deluge have been seen many days before
it approach'd the Earth, since 'twas in opposition to
the Sun?</p>
            <p>In Answer to which I say, That if it were
seen, as perhaps it was, and so the memory of
the Flood's happening upon it preserv'd; which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106675:27"/>
one of my Solutions will easily permit any one
to suppose;<note place="margin">Solut. 93.</note>
yet because its nearest approach

and
because withal 'twas not then imaginable,
that a blazing Star could drown the World; or
indeed could approach the Earth at all, 'tis not
to be expected that any Ancient History should
ascribe the Flood to it.</p>
            <p>(23.) 'Tis Objected, That whereas I assert that the
point <hi>B.</hi> or place of the Comet's passing by the Earth,<note place="margin">Fig. 3.</note>
by reason of the prevalence of the outward attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over the inward,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> S.</note> must have been five, six, or
seven degrees after the place of the <hi>Perihelion;</hi> on
the contrary, by the nearness of the inward attraction
downward, immediately after the passing by of the
Comet, so far as to over-balance the longer time of the
outward attraction, the point <hi>B.</hi> ought rather to be as
far before the <hi>Perihelion;</hi> and that, by consequence,
one of my greatest coincidences is gone, and my super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure
all precarious and false.</p>
            <p>In Answer to which I must ingenuously
own, that this is so far true as to take away the
distance between the point <hi>B,</hi> and the <hi>Perihelion;</hi>
which I before assign'd, upon a general view,
and before any trial by computation. Nay, I must
farther own that the above-mention'd inward
attraction, by reason of its nearness, does over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
the longer time of the outward; and
so the point <hi>B.</hi> must be rather on the other side of
the <hi>Perihelion.</hi> But then I must say 'tis on Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
so small, as is wholly inconsiderable;
and the point <hi>B,</hi> and the <hi>Perihelion</hi> coincident:
which being thus granted, unless we can find the
motion of the <hi>Perihelion</hi> to have been slower

than Mr. <hi>Flamstead's</hi> Table, which I alone men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd

difficulty in the present case, and destroy one
of the best Foundations of the <hi>New Theory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this Enquiry I find that Mr. <hi>Newton's</hi>
computation <hi>Ã  priori</hi> corrected,<note place="margin">P. 473.</note> allows but 53â…“

for the same number, <hi>viz.</hi> 53 10/11 Nay, that
<hi>Tycho's</hi> Tables allow only 50Â½, so that if we take
a mean 51Â½ this will bring the <hi>Perihelion</hi> at the
Deluge to the very day the 17th degree of <hi>Taurus,</hi>
and the 17th day of the second Month. Which
last computation of <hi>Tycho's</hi> as it was that I first
observ'd, so now I finding it so near the exactest

near it: and am not displeas<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Life in the days of <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Post. 2 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll. Solut. 33.</note>
is according to the
Chronology of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> at least equal to that
from the Creation to the Deluge, according to
the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> (from which latter the Calculations
of this 33d <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> are made) and since
withal the lives of Men at a <hi>Medium</hi> were du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that space from the conjoint Testimonies
of both the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Septuagint</hi> about 265
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106675:28"/>
years; 'Tis easy on the grounds proceeded on
there to prove, that in Case the <hi>Septuagint's</hi>
Chronology be receiv'd, the World must have
been much more populous in the days of <hi>Moses,</hi>
than it is at present; and that by consequence
Mankind has not increas'd but decreas'd in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
since those ancient days; contrary to the
most undoubted matter of Fact in all the past
and present Ages of the World. So that 'tis
evident that not only some pretended vast Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of years of the <hi>Egyptian Dynasties</hi> or <hi>Chinese</hi>
Reigns, with any other extravagant computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those kinds, enlarging the time since the

by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> nay, or the <hi>Samaritan Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi>
are false, and contrary to the certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the increase of Mankind in these latter
Ages of the World. Upon the whole therefore
no other accounts of the Ancient times, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
some have imagin'd, have rational Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature on their

               <hi>Corollary.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coroll. 5.</note> It may here deserve our Notice that

sixt in the days of <hi>Moses;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Solut. 7.</note> yet seeing
such things are gradual, and sooner reduc'd to
a Standard in some Families, Countries, and
Situations than others; it seems not necessary,
nay not probable that the Period was <hi>Universally</hi>
reduc'd to the lowest at the time assigned. So
that if in the next Period we find some instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Longevity which are hardly to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd
now, it will be no more than <hi>may,</hi>
nay,
than <hi>ought</hi> in reason to be expected in such a case.
Thus there is no reason to be surpriz'd that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>

And in like manner the Cases of <hi>Rahab, Booz,

(where four Generations reach'd about 400
years) which otherwise, notwithstanding what

if compar'd with later
times,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 12.</note> would appear very strange, and next to
incredible, are become hereby very easy, and
very agreeable to the state of things in those
Ancient Ages of the World.</p>
            <p>[By way of <hi>Corollary</hi> at the End of the Postscript.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corollary.</hi> The main Body of the 10 Tribes,
as well as of those two of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
returned out of Captivity, and resetled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Reign of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his Successors
in their own Land. This is, I confess, a new
conjecture, and contrary to what <hi>Iosephus</hi> really
does, and the Sacred History is suppos'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
touching this matter. But when 'tis better
consider'd, I imagine both <hi>Iosephus</hi> will be found
to deliver somewhat which will assist us to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
his Assertion, and the Sacred Books will be
found every where to establish what is directly
contrary to the common Opinion herein. It
may be own'd that the Catalogues of particular
Families mention'd by <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> do
not concern the 10 Tribes; nay, it may be
own'd, that in the first of <hi>Cyrus</hi> those carried
into <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the two Tribes alone returned
home; (and the Catalogues belong expresly
and singly to the first Return of all in the first
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 2. 1.</note> and that out of <hi>Babylon</hi> only.<note place="margin">Neh. 7. 5, 6.</note>) But
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106675:29"/>
that the Ten Tribes did not return either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after, or in the following Reigns, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the 2d of <hi>Darius,</hi> or the 7th or
20th of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> is, I think, improbable in it
self, and not agreeable to the Scriptures, nor to
that Assertion of <hi>Iosephus</hi> on which I ground
this Corollary, and which I now come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
The intire Number of those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
out of Captivity is not set down in
Scripture, but is by <hi>Iosephus;</hi> and 'tis thus:
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>.<note place="margin">Antiq. 1. 11. c. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The total
Summ of those who returned, above the Age of
twelve Years, was</hi> 4628000, without including
the <hi>Levites</hi> or their Families. Now if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this Summ taken out of the Old <hi>Iewish</hi>
Records, and that they, as in the Scriptures,
included only the Males, as 'tis reasonable to
do, it will appear that so great a Number must
relate to the whole twelve Tribes, not to those
of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> alone, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> asserts.
For seeing the Tribes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi>
together,<note place="margin">Vid. P. S.</note>
in the former numbering of 'em by
<hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 9.</note> were of Males above twenty Years old,
or that drew the Sword, about 500000, and
that after the allowance for their increase at
the rate of doubling in 360 Years, consider'd
with that mighty Diminution of 'em by <hi>Pekah,</hi>
the King of <hi>Israel</hi>'s slaying 120000 of 'em in
one Battle,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 28. 6.</note>
their Number at this their Return
from <hi>Babylon</hi> could not be much above one
Million; as on Calculation will appear.
This mighty Number in <hi>Iosephus</hi> may justly
seem much too large for the two Tribes, nay
to the full large enough for the twelve toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
as any one, who from the intire Number
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106675:30"/>
in <hi>David's</hi> Time,<note place="margin">Vid. P. S.</note> and the proportion of increase
till the Return out of Captivity, compar'd with
the mighty Diminution of 'em by <hi>Abiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 13. 17.</note>
the
King of <hi>Iudah's</hi> slaying Five hundred thousand
of 'em in one Battel, reduces this matter to
Calculation, may easily perceive. Which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
methinks is of considerable force to
prove that the ten Tribes are not lost, nor still
scatter'd abroad about <hi>Assyria</hi> alone, as is so
commonly suppos'd, but return'd with their
Brethren the <hi>Iews</hi> to their own Land; and
were with them subject to all the Accidents
mention'd by <hi>Iosephus</hi> under the <hi>Persian</hi> and
<hi>Grecian</hi> Empires, the <hi>Asmonaean</hi> or <hi>Maccabaean,</hi>
and <hi>Herodian</hi> Races, till their common and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Excision, and ultimate Dispersion by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
under <hi>Titus Vespasian.</hi> This Observation
and Corollary might easily be confirmed from
other Arguments. But that would be to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
too much from my Point. He who doubts
may see some confirmation in what Archbishop
<hi>Usher</hi> takes notice of (tho' without design to
prove what I say) at the Year of the World
3468. To which, together with his own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
hereafter, I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>'Tis perhaps worth our Enquiry,<note place="margin">Scholium post Corol.</note> whether
most mens Notions of the time for the abating
of the Waters of the Deluge be not very preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,<note place="margin">2 Solut. 61.</note>
at least if not wholly mistaken. 'Tis the
general Opinion, taken from the Mosaick Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Flood, that the Waters were wholly
subsided, and the Earth laid as dry in a manner
as 'tis at present, by that time <hi>Noah</hi> came out
of the Ark; or in the Space of about a Year,
from the beginning of the Flood. 'Tis true,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106675:30"/>
               <hi>Moses</hi> says,<note place="margin">Gen. 8. 3, 4.</note> that on the <hi>seventeenth Day of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Month the Waters were abated, and the Ark
rested on the Mountains of Ararat:</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 5.</note> That on the
<hi>first Day of the tenth Month the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
were seen:</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 13.</note> That on the <hi>first Day of the

And then lastly,<note place="margin">v. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> That on the <hi>twenty-seventh Day
of the second Month was the Earth dried,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi>
call'd out of the Ark. But all this may be very
true, and yet vast quantities of the Waters of
the Deluge might at the same time remain on
the face of the Earth. And as the present Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
may be still part of the same, so the rest of them
might require a hundred or two hundred
Years before they arriv'd at or near to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
subsidence and condition. And this, I think,
is the truth of the case, and is so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
the Sacred History, that it may be
establish'd by an Observation or two from
thence, as well as by the present <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of
Nature. As to the Sacred History of <hi>Moses,</hi> 'tis
first evident, that the Mountainous Regions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Ararat</hi> or <hi>Caucasus,</hi> especially since they
were, from my Hypothesis, particularly Elevated
above the rest, might be wholly clear of the
Waters in a year's time; and yet the lower
Plains and Valleys in a very different Case, and
still to a great depth under the Water: And
'tis as evident, 2ly, That we have no authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Account of the lower Plains, being become
dry and habitable, even in Regions more eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
than many others, I mean about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Parts of our Continent, till the Building of
<hi>Babel,</hi> the Confusion of Languages, and the

from the Deluge,<note place="margin">Gen. 10. 25. &amp; 11 3, 2.</note> in the days of <hi>Peleg.</hi> And
then as to the present <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, I
think they determin the Question before us, and
sufficiently demonstrate the longer abode of the
Waters of the Deluge upon the Earth than is
commonly allow'd. For as many Maritime
Countreys (which I have already observ'd, and
others have noted the same) do by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
even and smooth Surface,<note place="margin">Corol. 2. post Solut. 61. Mr. <hi>Ray's</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sico The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olog. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, P. 28, 29. 2d Edit.</note>
shew they
have been made so in length of time, by the
motion of the Sea, which now lays the Sands in
the same manner: So does the Consideration
of the Nature and Position of the <hi>Strata</hi> of the
Earth in some places now fully confirm the same
Observation. Near my Habitation, at present,
upon the Sea-coast, there is a pretty high and
remarkable Cliff, at the least twenty Foot above
the Surface of the Ocean adjoining: and yet
'tis to the very top <hi>Stratum</hi> of all almost as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
the Product of the Waters, laying Heaps,
<hi>Strata,</hi> and Beds of <hi>Sand</hi> and <hi>Chingle;</hi> as that
very Shore on which we stand, and which is
daily made and remov'd by the Tides and
Waves of the present Ocean. And as I do not
doubt from the always equal height of the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
every-where, that 'tis frequently thus in
other places also; so this is, I think, a plain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that the Ocean has been at least 20 Foot
higher than 'tis now: and that for a long time
together, sufficient I mean to heap up such
mighty Beds of Sand and Chingle as the present
observation does require. Which of it self is at
once a demonstration that all the lower Regions
near the Sea have formerly been drown'd, and
layn under water: And at the same time does
fully confirm that length of time which I assert
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106675:31"/>
was taken up in the intire subsidence of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Deluge.</p>
            <p>In this place I cannot but propose a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
I have for some time had in my mind
about the Peopling of <hi>China;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scholium post sect 2. Hypoth. 8.</note>
which I think
may deserve to be consider'd; and 'tis This.
That the <hi>Chinese</hi> are the Offspring of <hi>Noah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
after the Flood, and not deriv'd from any
of his other posterity <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> or <hi>Iaphet,</hi>
as the inhabitants of the rest of the World are.
This Conjecture depends on the following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
(1.) The account of the Posterity of
<hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> and of their dispersion,
gives no hint of any that went so far East as
<hi>China,</hi> as I think is plain from the best exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the 10th of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where that matter is
chiefly treated of. (2.) Since the dispersion of
the Posterity of <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> appears
to have begun about <hi>Babylon,</hi> a Countrey so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
as <hi>China</hi> could not be so soon reach'd and
peopled as the prodigious Numbers of its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
at present shew it to have been. The nearest
regions must have been first and most fully peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled;
and the remoter not till Men were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
sufficiently to require new Habitations;
and accordingly it has happen'd in the Countries
of <hi>Europe, Africa,</hi> and the Western parts of <hi>Asia;</hi>
to which I suppose the dispersion begun at <hi>Babel</hi>
is confin'd. But this is a sufficient proof that so
very large and prodigiously populous a Country
as <hi>China</hi> could not be of so late an Original, as
it must be in case the <hi>Chinese</hi> are deriv'd from this
dispersion. (3.) The Sacred History soon after the
Flood confines it self within the then known
World: (which, I think, did not include <hi>China,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:106675:32"/>
no more than <hi>America,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 19.</note>
and which is stil'd the <hi>whole
Earth</hi> very often in Scripture,) and at the same
time says not a word of the great Father of
the whole Race of Mankind, <hi>Noah:</hi> (excepting
the number of years he Liv'd.) Now this is, I
think, a kind of intimation that <hi>Noah</hi> had no
share in the Actions related in the Sacred Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
and so by a fair consequence was probably
plac'd in <hi>China,</hi> a region out of the compass of
the then known World. (4.) 'Tis otherwise
strange, that whereas <hi>Caucasus,</hi> the resting-place
of the Ark, was so near the middle of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
no footsteps should remain of any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
sent Eastward; but all Mankind should
take one course, and place themselves in the
Western Regions alone: and this at the same
time, that no reason can be given why the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Countreys should be more inviting to them
than the Eastern, since the latter certainly have
been as valuable and pleasant to the past and
present Ages, as the former. (5.) The <hi>Chinese</hi>
Language and Writing are so intirely different
from those with us which the confusion at <hi>Babel</hi>
introduc'd, and are at so vast a distance from them,
that I think they cannot well be deriv'd from
thence, nor from any of those Patriarchs whose
Posterity was there divided into the several
Parts of the World. All our Languages consist
of Words and Syllables made by a few Letters:
which is wholly different from the way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
intire Sounds, and of varying the sense
by Tones or Accents among the <hi>Chinese.</hi> All
which persuade me, that their Original is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from Ours: And that as we are the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> whose Sons
were scattered from <hi>Babel,</hi> so are they of <hi>Noah</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:106675:32"/>
who was no way interested in that Dispersion, or
in those Languages which are deriv'd therefrom.
(6.) The learned Sciences seem to have been
anciently much better known in <hi>China</hi> than in
these Parts of the World: Their Government
and Constitution much firmer, and more last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than Ours: Their most Ancient Histories
more Authentick and Certain than Ours; (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
those of more than humane Original.)
All which things make one ready to imagin,
that as 'tis probable <hi>Noah</hi> might be much wiser
and learneder than any of his Sons; so all those
Settlements, Laws, and Traditions, which are
deriv'd from him, are remarkable Effects and
Testimonies of the same: and therefore that in
<hi>China</hi> (where these Effects and Testimonies chiefly
appear) all those Prerogatives are owing to <hi>Noah,</hi>
their Original Founder, and to no other. (7.) There
are some Reasons to believe that the <hi>Chinese</hi>
mean no other by their first Monarch <hi>Fohi,</hi> than
<hi>Noah</hi> himself: For as the beginning of their
History, with the Reign of <hi>Fohi,</hi> will, if their
old years were Lunar, fall, even from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Verity, about the second Century of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's</hi>
Life; (as if they were Solar, they will fall
about the time of his Birth:) So what their
History of King <hi>Fohi</hi> mentions about his <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing,</hi>
and his Name of <hi>Sacrificer</hi> given him
from thence, seems plainly to refer to the Sacred
History of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> after the
Flood. From all which I think 'tis evident,
that we have good grounds to believe the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese</hi>
the Off-spring of <hi>Noah,</hi> by his Children
born after the Deluge: and that from this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Original proceeds all that difference
in other things, which is so remarkable, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106675:33"/>
with the rest of the World, in that Ancient
Numerous, and Learned Nation.</p>
