            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ias the wyse man came to Cresus the ryche
kyng, on a tyme, when he was makynge newe
shyppes, purposyng to haue subdued by water
the out yles lying betwixt Grece and Asia mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:
What newes now in Grece, saith the king
to Bias? None other newes, but these, sayeth
Bias: that the yles of Grece haue prepared a wonderful com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panye
of horsemen, to ouerrun Lydia withall. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
vnder heauen, sayth the kynge, that I woulde so soone
wisshe, as that they durst be so bolde, to mete vs on the lande
with horse. And thinke you sayeth Bias, that there is anye
thyng which they wolde sooner wysshe, then that you shulde
be so fonde, to mete them on the water with shyppes? And so
Cresus hearyng not the true newes, but perceyuyng the wise
mannes mynde and counsell, both gaue then ouer makyng of
his shyppes, and left also behynde him a wonderful example
for all commune wealthes to folowe: that is euermore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
and set most by that thing whervnto nature hath made
them moost apt, and vse hath made them moost fitte.</p>
            <p>By this matter I meane the shotyng in the long bowe, for
English men: which thyng with all my hert I do wysh, and if
I were of authoritie, I wolde counsel all the gentlemen and
yomen of Englande, not to chaunge it with any other thyng,
how good soeuer it seme to be: but that styll, accordyng to the
oulde wont of England, youth shulde vse it for the moost ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
pastyme in peace, that men myght handle it as a mooste
sure weapon in warre. Other stronge weapons whiche bothe
experience doth proue to be good, and the wysdom of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
Maiestie &amp; his counsel prouydes to be had, are not ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to take away shotyng: but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both, not compared togither,
whether shuld be better then the other, but so ioyned togither
that the one shoulde be alwayes an ayde and helpe for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
myght so strengthen the Realme on all sydes, that no
kynde of enemy in any kynde of weapon, myght passe and go
beyonde vs.</p>
            <p>For this purpose I, partelye prouoked by the counsell of
some gentlemen, partly moued by the loue whiche I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
borne towarde shotyng, haue wrytten this lytle trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,

yf I haue sayed a misse, I am content that any man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
it, or yf I haue sayd to lytle, any man that wyl to adde
what hym pleaseth to it.</p>
            <p>My minde is, in profitynge and pleasynge euery man, to
hurte or displease no man, intendyng none other purpose, but
that youthe myght be styrred to labour, honest pastyme, and
vertue, and as much as laye in me, plucked from ydlenes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftie

an excercise for the bodye, not vile for great men to vse,
not costlye for poore men to susteyne, not lurking in holes and
corners for ill men at theyr pleasure, to misvse it, but abiding
in the open sight &amp; face of the worlde, for good men if it fault
by theyr wisdome to correct it.</p>
            <p>And here I woulde desire all gentlemen and yomen, to vse
this pastime in suche a mean, that the outragiousnes of great
gamyng, shuld not hurte the honestie of shotyng, which of his
owne nature is alwayes ioyned with honestie: yet for mennes
faultes oftentymes blamed vnworthely, as all good thynges
haue ben, and euermore shall be.</p>
            <p>If any man woulde blame me, eyther for takynge such a

this answere I maye make hym, that whan the beste of the
realme thinke it honest for them to vse, I one of the meanest
sorte, ought not to suppose it vile for me to write: And though
to haue written it in an other tonge, had bene bothe more pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable
for my study, and also more honest for my name, yet I
can thinke my labour wel bestowed, yf w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a litle hynderaunce
of my profyt and name, maye come any fourtheraunce, to the
pleasure or commoditie, of the gentlemen and yeomen of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande,
for whose sake I tooke this matter in hande. And as
for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Latin or greke tonge, euery thyng is so excellently done
in them, that none can do better: In the Englysh tonge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
euery thinge in a maner so meanly, bothe for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and handelynge, that no man can do worse. For therin the
least learned for the moste parte, haue ben alwayes moost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
<pb facs="tcp:4601:5"/>
to wryte. And they whiche had leaste hope in latin, haue
bene moste boulde in englyshe: when surelye euery man that
is moste ready to taulke, is not moost able to wryte. He that
wyll wryte well in any tongue, muste folowe thys councel of
Aristotle, to speake as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people do, to thinke as wise
men do: and so shoulde euery man vnderstande hym, and the
iudgement of wyse men alowe hym. Many English writers
haue not done so, but vsinge straunge wordes as latin, french
and Italian, do make all thinges darke and harde. Ones I
communed with a man whiche reasoned the englyshe tongue
to be enryched and encreased therby, sayinge: Who wyll not
prayse that feaste, where a man shall drinke at a diner, bothe
wyne, ale and beere? Truely quod I, they be all good, euery
one taken by hym selfe alone, but if you putte Maluesye and
sacke, read wyne and white, ale and beere, and al in one pot,
you shall make a drynke, neyther easie to be knowen, nor yet
holsom for the bodye. Cicero in folowyng I focrates, Plato
and Demosthenes, increased the latine tounge after an other
sorte. This waye, bycause dyuers men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> write, do not know,
they can neyther folowe it, bycause of theyr ignorauncie, nor
yet will prayse it, for verye arrogauncie, ii. faultes, seldome
the one out of the others companye.</p>
            <p>Englysh writers by diuersitie of tyme, haue taken diuerse
matters in hande. In our fathers tyme nothing was red, but
bookes of fayned cheualrie, wherin a man by redinge, shuld
be led to none other ende, but onely to manslaughter and bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye.
Yf any man suppose they were good ynough to passe the
time with al, he is deceyued. For surelye vayne woordes doo
woorke no smal thinge in vayne, ignoraunt, and younge min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
specially yf they be gyuen any thynge thervnto of theyr
owne nature. These bokes (as I haue heard say) were made
the moste parte in Abbayes, and Monasteries, a very lickely
and fit fruite of suche an ydle and blynde kinde of lyuynge.</p>
            <p>In our tyme nowe, whan euery manne is gyuen to knowe
muche rather than to liue wel, very many do write, but after
suche a fashion, as very many do shoote. Some shooters take
in hande stronger bowes, than they be able to mayntayne.</p>
            <p>This thyng maketh them su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mtyme, to outshoote the marke,
su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mtyme to shote far wyde, and perchaunce hurte su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me that
looke on. Other that neuer learned to shote, nor yet knoweth
good shafte nor bowe, wyll be as busie as the best, but suche

be agaynst him, will be bothe glad of hym, and also euer rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
to laye and bet with him: it were better for suche one to sit
doune than shote. Other there be, whiche haue verye good
bowe and shaftes, and good knowlege in shootinge, but they
haue bene brought vp in suche euyl fauoured shootynge, that
they can neyther shoore fayre, nor yet nere. Yf any man wyll
applye these thynges togyther, shal not se the one farre differ
from the other.</p>
            <p>And I also amonges all other, in writinge this lytle trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
haue folowed su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me yonge shooters, whiche bothe wyll
begyn to shoote, for a lytle moneye, and also wyll vse to shote
ones or twise about the marke for nought, afore they beginne
a good. And therfore did I take this litle matter in hande, to
assaye my selfe, and hereafter by the grace of God, if the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
of wyse men, that looke on, thinke that I can do any
good, I maye perchaunce caste my shafte amonge other, for
better game.</p>
            <p>Yet in writing this booke, some man wyll maruayle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce,
why that I beyng an vnperfyte shoter, shoulde take
in hande to write of makyng a perfyte archer: the same man
peraduenture wyll maruayle, howe a whettestone whiche is
blunte, can make the edge of a knife sharpe: I woulde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
man shulde consider also, that in goyng about anye matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there be .iiii. thinges to be considered, doyng, saying, thinking
and perfectnesse: Firste there is no man that doth so wel, but
he can saye better, or elles summe men, whiche be now starke
nought, shuld be to good: Agayne no man can vtter wyth his
tong, so wel as he is able to imagin with his minde, &amp; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnesse
it selfe is farre aboue all thinking. Than seing that
saying is one steppe nerer perfectenesse than doyng, let euery
man leue maruaylyng why my woorde shall rather expresse,
than my dede shall perfourme perfecte shootinge.</p>
            <p>I truste no man will be offended with this litle booke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
it be su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me fletchers and bowiers, thinking hereby that
manye that loue shootynge shall be taughte to refuse suche
noughtie wares as they woulde vtter. Honest fletchers and
bowyers do not so, and they that be vnhonest, oughte rather
to amende them selues for doinge ill, than be angrie with me

hath to a fletcher y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> forsaketh to bye of him a noughtie knyfe:
For as an archer must be content that a fletcher know a good
shafte in euery poynte for the perfecter makynge of it, So an
honeste fletcher will also be content that a shooter knowe a
good shafte in euery poynt for the perfiter vsing of it: bicause
the one knoweth like a fletcher how to make it, the other kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth
lyke an archer howe to vse it. And seyng the knowlege
is one in them bothe, yet the ende diuerse, surely that fletcher
is an enemye to archers and artillery, whiche can not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that an archer knowe a shafte as well for his vse in sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge,
as he hym selfe shoulde knowe a shafte, for hys ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage
in sellynge. And the rather bycause shaftes be not
made so muche to be solde, but chefely to be vsed. And seynge
that vse and occupiyng is the ende why a shafte is made, the
making as it were a meane for occupying, surely the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
in euery poynte of a good shafte, is more to be required in
a shooter than a fletcher.</p>
            <p>Yet as I sayde before no honest fletcher wil be angry with
me, seinge I do not teache howe to make a shafte whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
onelye to a good fletcher, but to knowe and handle a
shafte, which belongeth to an archer. And this lytle booke I
truste, shall please and profite both partes: For good bowes
and shaftes shall be better knowen to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of al sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and good shotyng may perchaunce be the more occupied
to the profite of all bowyers and fletchers. And thus I praye
God that all fletchers getting theyr lyuynge truly, and al ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
vsynge shootynge honestly, and all maner of men
that fauour artillery, maye lyue continuallye in
healthe and merinesse, obeying theyr
prince as they shulde, and louing
God as they ought, to whom
for al thinges be al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <p>That Aristotle

proue. And as for your husbandrie, it was more

then throughly proued with reasons belongynge to

somtime of the daye, and sometime of the yere, made
asmoche for the encrease of learning, as to let the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
lye sometime falloe, maketh for the better encrease
of corne. This we se, yf the lande be plowed euerye
yere, the corne commeth thinne vp: the eare is short,
the grayne is small, and when it is brought into the
barne and threshed, gyueth very euill faul. So those
which neuer leaue poring on their bokes, haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

or piping lyke a reede, or roring lyke a bull, as some

where euery parte of the bodye must be laboured to

be nothing fit for studentes, bycause the body which
is moost hurte by studie, shulde take no profyte at all

you and other so moche. But I truste after I haue
sayd my mynde in this matter, you shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse your

                  </gap>fe that you do rebuke this thing more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye nede,
rather then you shal fynde that any man may spende
by anye possibilittie, more tyme in shotinge then he
ought. For first and formoost the hole tyme is deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into .ii. partes, the daye and the night: whereof
the night maye be both occupyed in many honest bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses,
and also spent in moche vnthriftinesse, but in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4601:23"/>
no wise it can be applyed to shoting. And here you se
that halfe oure tyme, graunted to all other thinges
in a maner both good and ill, is at one swappe quite
taken awaye from shoting. Now let vs go forward,
and se how moche of halfe this tyme of ours is spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in shoting. The hole yere is deuided into .iiii. partes,
Spring tyme, Somer, faule of the leafe, and winter
wherof the whole winter, for the roughnesse of it, is
cleane taken away from shoting: except it be one day
amonges .xx. or one yeare amonges .xl. In Somer,
for the feruent heate, a man maye saye likewyse: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be somtyme agaynst night. Now then spring
tyme and faule of the leafe be those which we abuse
in shoting. But if we consider how mutable &amp; chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geable
the wether is in those seasons, and howe that
Aristotle him selfe sayth, that mooste parte of rayne
fauleth in these two tymes: we shall well perceyue,
that where a man wolde shote one daye, he shall be
fayne to leaue of .iiii. Now when tyme it selfe grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vs but a litle space to shote in, lette vs se if sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
be not hindered amonges all kyndes of men as
moche otherwayes. First, yong childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vse not, yong
men for feare of them whom they be vnder tomoche
dare not: sage men for other greater businesses, wyll
not: aged men for lacke of strengthe, can not: Ryche
men for couetousnesse sake, care not: poore men for
cost and charge, may not: masters for their housholde
keping, hede not: seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes kept in by their maisters
very oft, shall not: craftes men for getting of their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
verye moche leysure haue not: and many there
be that oft beginnes, but for vnaptnesse proues not:
<pb facs="tcp:4601:24"/>
and moost of all, whiche when they be shoters gyue
it ouer and lyste not, so that generallye men euerye
where for one or other consideration moche shoting
vse not. Therfore these two thinges, straytenesse of
tyme, and euery man his trade of liuing, are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that so fewe men shotes: as you maye se in this
greate towne, where as there be a thousande good
mens bodies, yet scarse .x. y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vseth any great shoting.
And those whome you se shote the moost, with how
many thinges are the drawen, or rather driuen, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
shoting. For first, as it is many a yere or they begyn
to be greate shoters, euen so the greate heate of sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
is gone within a yere or two: as you knowe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
Philologe your selfe, which were sometyme the
best shoters, and now they be the best studentes.</p>
               <p>If a man faule sycke, farewell shoting, maye fortune
as long as he lyueth. If he haue a wrentche, or haue
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> colde in his arme, he may hang vp his bowe (I
warraunt you) for one season. A litle blayne, a small
cutte, yea a silie poore worme in his finger, may kepe
him from shoting wel ynough. Breaking and ill luck
in bowes I wyll passe ouer, with an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred mo sere
thinges, whiche chaunceth euerye daye to them that
shote moost, wherof the leest of them may compell a

and euident, that it is impossible either for me craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telye
to fayne them, or els for you iustly to deny the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seing how many hundred thinges are required

               <p>I can not deny, but shoting (as all other good
thinges) may be abused. And good thinges vngood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

that we laye not mennes faultes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thing
which is not worthie, for so nothing shulde be good.
And as for shoting, it is blamed and marked of men
for that thing (as I sayde before) which shoulde be
rather a token of honestie to prayse it, then any signe
of noughtinesse to disalowe it, and that is bycause it
is in euerye man his sight, it seketh no corners, it hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it not: if there be neuer so litle fault in it, euerye
man seeth it, it accuseth it selfe. For one houre spente
in shoting is more sene and further talked of, then .xx
nightes spent in dysing, euen as a litle white stone is
sene amonges .iii. hundred blacke. Of those that
blame shotinge and shoters, I wyll saye nomore at

One, whan he had lost his moneye, sware me God,

his money for lacke of sweringe: The other, losyng
his money, and heaping othes vpon othes, one in a

rebuked of an honest man whiche stode, by for so do
doynge, he by and by starynge him in the face, and
clappyng his fiste with all his moneye he had, vpon

For how can that pastyme whiche neither exerciseth

               <p>In dede as for greate men, and greate mennes

woulde wysshe that all great men in Englande had
red ouer diligentlye the Pardoners tale in Chaucer,
and there they shoulde perceyue and se, howe moche
suche games stande with theyr worshyppe, howe

many learned men in many places do saye, and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
experience doth playnelye shewe, in costlye appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
and other lyke matters.</p>
               <p>Therfore, seing that Lordes be lanternes to leade
the lyfe of meane men, by their example, eyther to
goodnesse or badnesse, to whether soeuer they liste:
and seinge also they haue libertie to lyste what they
wiil, I pray God they haue will to list that which is
good, and as for their playing, I wyll make an ende
with this saying of Chaucer.</p>

               <p>But to be shorte, the best medicine for all sortes of

suche vnlawfull games is by the contrarye,
lykewyse as all physicions do alowe in physike. So
let youthe in steade of suche vnlefull games, whiche
stande by ydlenesse, by solitarinesse, and corners, by
night and darkenesse, by fortune &amp; chaunce, by crafte
and subtiltie, vse suche pastimes as stand by labour:

suche an ende as is come to by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, rather then by

For contrarye pastimes, must nedes worke contrary
mindes in men, as all other contrary thinges doo.</p>
               <p>And thus we se Philologe, that shoting is not onely
the moost holesome exercise for the bodye, the moost

they wel perceyued that an hoste full of obedyence,
falleth as seldome into the handes of theyr enemies

I perceyue that sentence of Plato to be true, which
sayeth that there is nothyng better in any common

and in sekyng for that purpose, he marked this

neuerthelesse you shall perceaue if you wyl, that vse

are the onelye causes of stronge shootyng in warre,
and why? for you se, that the strongest men, do not
drawe alwayes the strongest shoote, whiche thyng
prouethe that drawinge stronge, liethe not so muche
in the strength of man, as in the vse of shotyng. And
experience teacheth the same in other thynges, for
you shal se a weake smithe, whiche wyl wyth a lipe

another man thrise as stronge, can not stirre. And a
strong man not vsed to shote, hath his armes breste
and shoulders, and other partes wherwith he shuld
drawe stronglye, one hindering and stoppinge an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <p>Of Use you speake very much Toxophile but
I am sure in al other matters, Use can do nothing,
wythoute two other thinges be ioyned wyth it, one
is a natural Aptnesse to a thinge, the other is a true
waye or Knowlege, howe to do the thing, to which
ii. yf Use be ioyned, as thirde felowe, of them thre,
procedeth perfectnesse and excellencie: If a manne
lacke the first two, Aptnesse and Cunnyng, Use can
do lytle good, at all. For he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> woulde be an oratour
and is nothinge naturallye fitte for it, that is to saye
lacketh a good wytte and memorie, lacketh a good
voyce, countenaunce and body, and other suche like,
ye yf he had all these thinges, and knewe not what,
howe, where, when nor to whome he shulde speake,
surelye the vse of spekynge, woulde brynge out none
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4601:51"/>
other frute but playne follye and bablyng, so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Use
is the laste and the least necessarye, of all thre, yet no
thing can be done excellently without them al thre.
And therfore Toxophile I my selfe bicause I neuer
knewe, whether I was apte for shooting or no, nor
neuer knewe waye, howe I shulde learne to shoote
I haue not vsed to shoote: and so I thinke fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred
more in Englande do besyde me. And surely yf
I knewe that I were apte, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you woulde teach
me howe to shoote, I woulde become an archer, and
the rather, bycause of the good communication, the
whiche I haue had with you this daye, of shotyng.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>TOX.</speaker>
               <p>Aptnesse, Knowlege, and Use, euen as you
saye, make all thinges perfecte. Aptnesse is the fyrst
and chyefest thinge, without whiche the other two
do no good at all. Knowledge doeth encrease al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Aptnesse, bothe lesse and more. Use sayth Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,
is farre aboue all teachinge. And thus they all
three muste be had, to do any thinge very well, and
yf anye one be awaye, what so euer is done, is done
verye meanly. Aptnesse is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gyfte of nature, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
is gotten by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> helpe of other: Use lyeth in our
owne diligence &amp; labour. So that Aptnesse &amp; vse be
ours and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in vs, through nature &amp; labour: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
not ours, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mynge by other: and therfore
moost diligently, of all men to be sought for. Howe
these three thinges stande with the artillery of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande,
a woorde or twoo I will saye.</p>
               <p>All Englishe men generally, be apte for shotyng,
and howe? Lyke as that grounde is plentifull and
frutefull, whiche withoute anye tyllynge, bryngeth
<pb facs="tcp:4601:52"/>
out corne, as for example, yf a man shoulde go to the
myll or market with corne, and happen to spyl some
in the waye, yet it wolde take roote and growe, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> soyle is so good: so Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d may be thought
very frutefull and apt to brynge oute shoters, where
children euen from the cradell, loue it: and yong men
without any teachyng so diligentlye vse it. Agayne,
lykewyse as a good grounde, well tylled, and well
husbanded, bringeth out great plentie of byg <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

corne, and good to the faule: so if the youthe of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande
being apte of it selfe to shote, were taught and
learned how to shote, the Archers of England shuld
not be only a great deale ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ker, and mo then they be:
but also a good deale bygger and stronger Archers
then they be. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie shoulde folowe also y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the youth of Englande were taught to shote, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as plowing of a good grounde for wheate, doth
not onely make it mete for the seede, but also riueth
and plucketh vp by the rootes, all thistles, brambles
and weedes, which growe of theyr owne accorde, to
the destruction of bothe corne and grounde: Euen so
shulde the teaching of youth to shote, not only make
them shote well, but also plucke awaye by the rootes
all other desyre to noughtye pastymes, as disynge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
cardyng, and boouling, which without any teaching
are vsed euery where, to the great harme of all youth
of this realme. And lykewise as burnyng of thistles
and diligent weding them out of the corne, doth not
halfe somocheryd them, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ground is falloed
and tilled for good grayne, as I haue hearde many

nor yet diligent searching out of suche vnthrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse
by the officers, shal so throwly wede these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious
games out of the realme, as occupying and
bringyng vp youth in shotynge, and other honest pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styme.
Thirdly, as a grounde which is apt for corne
and also wel tilled for corne: yet if a man let it lye stil
and do not occupye it .iii. or .iiii. yeare: but then wyll
sow it, if it be wheate (sayth Columella) it wil turne
into rye: so if a man be neuer so apte to shote, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so wel taught in his youth to shote, yet if he giue
it ouer, and not vse to shote, truly when he shalbe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled in warre tyme for his countrye sake, or
els prouoked at home for his pleasure sake, to faule
to his bowe: he shalbe come of a fayre archer, a stark
squyrter and dribber. Therefore in shotynge, as in
all other thinges, there can neyther be many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
nor excellent in dede: excepte these .iii. thynges,
Aptnesse, Knowledge, and Use goo togyther.</p>

and therefore I can not a lytle maruayle, why En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glysshe

nature it selfe gyueth them. For you se that euen chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren
be put to theyr owne shiftes in shotyng, hauing
nothynge taughte them: but that they maye chose,
and chaunce to shoote ill, rather then well, vnaptlye
soner then fitlye, vnto wardlye, more easely then wel
fauouredlye, whiche thynge causeth manye neuer
begynne to shoote: and moo to leaue it of when they

This knowe Paynters, karuers, Taylours, shoma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kers,

                  </gap> a perfite excellencie, which may

which you speke on wil discourage men to take
any thynge in hande, bycause afore they begin, they
know, they shal neuer come to an ende. And thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spayre
shall dispatche, euen at the fyrste entrynge in,
many a good man his purpose and intente. And I
thinke both you your selfe, &amp; al other men to, would
counte it mere folie for a man to tell hym whome he
teacheth, that he shal neuer optaine that, whyche he
would fainest learne. And therfore this same hyghe

they knowe, they shall neuer attayne vnto it, I am
sure cleane contrarie there is nothynge in the world
shall incourage men more than it. And whye? For
where a man seith, that though a nother man be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so excellente, yet it is possible for hym selfe to be
better, what payne or labour wyl that man refuse to
take? yf the game be onse wonne, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyl set forth
hys foote to ronne. And thus perfitnesse beynge so
hyghe a thynge that men maye looke at it, not come
to it, and beynge so plentifull and indifferent to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
bodye that the plentifulnesse of it maye prouoke
all men to labor, bycause it hath ynoughe for all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
the indifferencye of it shall encourage euerye one to

yet whych is moste meruel of al, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more men take of

discomend that way, except he thincke himselfe wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser

he teached any maner of crafte as he dyd Rhetorike
he would labor to bringe a man to the knowlege of

               <p>Litle
is to be sayd of the braser. A bracer serueth for two
causes, one to saue his arme from the strype of the
strynge, and his doublet from wearynge, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, that the strynge glydynge sharpelye &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
of the bracer, maye make the sharper shoote. For
if the strynge shoulde lyght vpon the bare fleue, the
strengthe of the shoote shoulde stoppe and dye there.
But it is best by my iudgemente, to gyue the bowe
so muche bent, that the strynge neede neuer touche a
mannes arme, and so shoulde a man nede no bracer
as I knowe manye good Archers, whiche occupye
none. In a bracer a man muste take hede of .iii. thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

that it be fast on with laces wythout agglettes.</p>

For the nayles wyll shere in sunder, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes string,
before he be ware, and so put his bowe in ieoperdy:
Buckles and agglettes at vnwares, shall race hys
bowe, a thinge bothe euyll to the syghte, &amp; perilous
for freatynge. And thus a Bracer, is onelye had for
this purpose, that the strynge maye haue redye pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</p>

               <p>A shootynge Gloue is chieflye, for to saue a
mannes fyngers from hurtynge, that he maye be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to beare the sharpe stryng to the vttermost of his
strengthe. And whan a man shooteth, the might of
his shoote lyeth on the formooste fynger, and on the
Ringman, for the myddle fynger whiche is the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
lyke a lubber starteth backe, and beareth no
weyght of the strynge in a maner at all, therfore the
two other fyngers, muste haue thicker lether, &amp; that
muste haue thickest of all, where on a man lowseth
moste, and for sure lowsyng, the formoste fynger is
moste apte, bycause it holdeth best, &amp; for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> purpose
nature hath as a man woulde saye, yocked it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the

yet youre fynger hurteth, you muste take a searynge
cloth made of fine virgin waxe, and Deres sewet, &amp;
put nexte your fynger, and so on wyth youre gloue.
If yet you fele your fynger pinched, leaue shootyng

haue a goose quyll splettyd and sewed againste the
nockynge, betwixt the lining and the ledder, whyche
shall helpe the shoote muche to, the other waye is to
haue some roule of ledder sewed betwixt his fingers
at the setting on of the fingers, which shall kepe his
fingers so in sunder, that they shal not hold the nock
so fast as they did. The shootyng gloue hath a purse

a good shootynge bowe for oure purpose.</p>
               <p>Euerye bowe is made eyther of a boughe, of a

pithe, and soue wyll folowe the stringe, and seldome
werith to any fayre coloure, yet for chyldren &amp; yonge

of the woode leadethe a man, or elles by all reason it
must sone breake, &amp; that in many shiuers. This must
be considered in the roughe woode, &amp; when the bow
staues be ouerwrought and facioned. For in dressing
and pikynge it vp for a bow, it is to late to loke for it
But yet in these poyntes as I sayd before you muste

A bowecase of ledder, is not the best, for that is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
moyste which hurteth the bowes very much.
Therfore I haue sene good shooters which would
haue for euerye bowe, a sere case made of wollen
clothe, and than you maye putte .iii. or .iiii. of them
so cased, in to a ledder case if you wyll. This wollen
case shall bothe kepe them in sunder, and also wylle
kepe a bowe in his full strengthe, that it neuer gyue
for any wether. At home these wood cases be verye
good for bowes to stande in. But take hede y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> youre
bowe stande not to nere a stone wall, for that wyll
make hym moyste and weke, nor yet to nere any fier
for that wyll make him shorte and brittle. And thus
muche as concernyng the sauyng and keping of our
bowe: nowe you shall heare what thynges ye must
auoyde, for feare of breakyng your bowe.</p>
               <p>A shooter chaunseth to breake his bowe common
ly .iiii. wayes, by the strynge, by the shafte, by dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng
to far, &amp; by freates: By the stryng as I sayde
afore, whan the strynge is eyther to shorte, to long,
not surely put on, wyth one wap, or put croked on,
or shorne in sundre wyth an euell nocke, or suffered
to tarye ouer longe on. Whan the stryng fayles the
bowe muste nedes breake, and specially in the myd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:
because bothe the endes haue nothyng to stop
them: but whippes so far backe, that the belly must
nedes violentlye rise vp, the whyche you shall well
<pb facs="tcp:4601:68"/>
perreyue in bendyng of a bowe backward. Therfore
a bowe that foloweth the strynge is least hurt with
breakyng of stringes By the shafte a bowe is broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ether when it is to short, and so you set it in your bow
or when the nocke breakes for lytlenesse, or when the
strynge slyppes wythoute the nocke for wydenesse,
than you poule it to your care and lettes it go, which
must nedes breake the shafte at the leaste, and putte
strunge and bow &amp; al in ieopardy, bycause the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
of the bowe hath nothynge in it to stop the violence
of it.</p>
               <p>Thys kynde of breakynge is mooste perilouse
for the standers by, for in such a case you shall se some
tyme the ende of a bow flye a hoole score from a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and that moost commonly, as I haue marked oft the
vpper ende of the bowe. The bow is drawne to far
.ii. wayes. Eyther when you take a longer shafte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
your owne, or els when you shyfte your hand to low
or to hye for shootynge far. Thys waye pouleth the
backe in sunder, and then the bowe fleethe in manye
peces.</p>
               <p>So when you se a bowe broken, hauynge the
bellye risen vp both wayes or toue, the stringe brake
it. When it is broken in twoo peces in a maner euen
of and specyallye in the vpper ende, the shafte nocke
brake it.</p>
               <p>When the backe is pouled a sunder in manye pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to farre drawynge, brake it.</p>
               <p>These tokens eyther alwayes be trewe or els verye

The fourthe thyng that breketh a bowe is fretes,<note place="margin">Freates.</note>
whych make a bowe redye and apte to breake by any
of the .iii. wayes afore sayde. Freetes be in a shaft as
well as in a bowe, and they be muche lyke a Canker,
crepynge and encreasynge in those places in a bowe,
whyche be weaker then other. And for thys purpose
must your bowe be well trymmed and piked of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the pinches, to make them somewhat weker, and as

freates.</p>
               <p>Freates begynne many tymes in a pin, for there
the good woode is corrupted, that it muste nedes be

               <p>Agayne bowes moost commonlye freate vnder
the hande, not so muche as some men suppose for the

the nature of heate sayeth Aristotle is to lowse, and
not to knyt fast, and the more lowser the more wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4601:69"/>
bowe is not well made, whych hath not wood plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye

I neuer hard tell of any, but onelye to make the

               <p>To fill vp the freate with lytle sheuers of a quill and
glewe (as some saye wyll do wel) by reason must be
starke nought.</p>
               <p>For, put case the freete dyd cease then, yet the cause
whiche made it freate a fore (and that is weakenesse
of the place) bicause it is not taken away must nedes
make it freate agayne. As for cuttyng out of freates
wythe all maner of pecynge of bowes I wyll cleane
exclude from perfite shootynge. For peced bowes be
muche lyke owlde housen, whyche be more charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

yf they consyder it well, they shall fynde it, bothe lesse

A stele muste be well seasoned for Castinge, and it

                  </gap>haste, but for a lytle shafte it is nothynge fit, bothe
bycause it wyll neuer flye far, and besydes that it is
euer in danger of breakynge, it flieth not far bycause
the strengthe of the shoote is hindred and stopped at
the knotte, euen as a stone cast in to a plaine euen stil
water, wyll make the water moue a greate space, yet
yf there be any whirlynge plat in the water, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge
ceasethe when it commethe at the whyrlynge

yf it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered wel. So euery thyng as it is plaine
and streight of hys owne nature so is it fittest for far
mouynge. Therfore a stele whyche is harde to sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
in a bowe, without knotte, and streighte (I meane
not artificiallye streyghte as the fletcher dothe make
it, but naturally streyght as it groweth in the wood)
is best to make a shaft of, eyther to go cleane, fly far
or stand surely in any wedder. Now howe big, how
small, how heuye, how lyght, how longe, how short,
a shafte shoulde be particularlye for euerye man (se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
we must taulke of the generall nature of shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng)
can not be toulde no more than you Rhethori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
can appoynt any one kynde of wordes, of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
of fygures fyt for euery matter, but euen as
the man and the matter requyreth so the fyttest to be
vsed. Therfore as concernynge those contraryes in

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4601:71"/>
the meane of them, whyche meane is best in al thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Yet yf a man happen to offende in any of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
it is better to offend in want and scantnesse,
than in to muche and outragiouse excedynge. As it
is better to haue a shafte a lytle to shorte than ouer
longe, somewhat to lyght, than ouer lumpysshe, a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to small, than a greate deale to big, whiche thyng
is not onely trewlye sayde in shootynge, but in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thynges that euer man goeth aboute, as in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge,
taulkynge, and all other thynges lyke, whych
matter was onse excellentlye disputed vpon, in the
Scooles, you knowe when.</p>
               <p>And to offend, in these contraryes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth much yf
men take not hede, throughe the kynd of wood, wher
of the shaft is made: For somme wood belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
excedyng part, some to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t part, some to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meane,

such lyke, make deade, heuy lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pish, hobblyng shaftes
Againe Hulder, blacke thorne, Serues tree, Beche,
Elder, Aspe, and Salowe, eyther for theyr wekenes
or lyghtenesse, make holow, starting, studding, gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
shaftes. But Birche, Hardbeme, some Doke,
and some Asshe, beynge bothe stronge ynoughe to
stande in a bowe, and also lyght ynoughe to flye far,
are best for a meane, whiche is to be soughte oute in
euery thinge. And althoughe I knowe that some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
shoote so stronge, that the deade woodes be lyghte
ynoughe for them, and other some so weeke, that the
lowse woodes be lykewyse for them bigge ynoughe
yet generally for the moost parte of men, the meane
is the best. And so to conclude that, is alwayes beste
<pb facs="tcp:4601:72"/>
for a man, whiche is metest for him. Thus no wood
of his owne nature, is eyther to lyght or to heuy, but
as the shooter is him selfe whyche dothe vse it. For
that shafte whiche one yeare for a man is to lyghte &amp;
scuddinge, for the same selfe man the next yeare may
chaunce be to heuy and hobblynge. Therfore can not
I expresse, excepte generally, what is best wood for
a shaft, but let euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he knoweth his owne
strength and the nature of euery wood, prouyde and
fyt himselfe thereafter. Yet as concerning sheaffe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couse
for war (as I suppose) it were better to make
them of good Asshe, and not of Aspe, as they be now
a dayes. For of all other woodes that euer I proued
Asshe being big is swiftest and agayne heuy to giue
a greate stripe with all, whyche Aspe shall not doo.</p>
               <p>What heuynes doth in a stripe euery man by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can tell, therfore Asshe being both swyfter and
heuier is more fit for sheafe Arroes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Aspe, &amp; thus
muche for the best wood for shaftes.</p>
               <p>Agayne lykewyse as no one wood can be greatlye
meet for all kynde of shaftes, no more can one facion
of the stele be fit for euery shooter. For those that be
lytle brested and big toward the hede called by theyr
lykenesse taperfashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reshe growne, and of some me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
fellowes bobtayles, be fit for them whiche shote
vnder hande bycause they shoote wyth a softe lowse,
and stresses not a shaft muche in the breste where the
weyghte of the bowe lyethe as you maye perceyue
by the werynge of euery shafte.</p>
               <p>Agayne the bygge brested shafte is fytte for hym,
which shoteth right afore him, or els the brest being

weke shoulde neuer wythstande that strong piththy
kynde of shootynge, thus the vnderhande must haue
a small breste, to go cleane awaye oute of the bowe,
the forehande muste haue a bigge breste to bere the
great myghte of the bowe. The shafte must be made
rounde nothynge flat wyth oute gal or wemme, for
thys purpose. For bycause roundnesse (whether you
take example in heauen or in earthe) is fittest shappe
and forme both for fast mouing and also for sone per
cynge of any thynge. And therfore Aristotle saythe
that nature hath made the raine to be round, bycause
it shoulde the easelyer enter throughe the ayre.</p>
               <p>The nocke of the shafte is dyuersly made, for some

some narow, some depe, some shalowe, some round,

               <p>The greate and full nocke, maye be well felte, and
many wayes they saue a shafte from brekynge. The
hansome and lytle nocke wyll go clene awaye frome

of the shafte and also for soden slyppynge oute
of the strynge when the narrowe nocke doth auoyde
bothe those harmes. The depe and longe nocke is
good in warre for sure kepyng in of the strynge. The
shalow, and rownde nocke is best for our purpose in
prickyng for cleane delyueraunce of a shoote. And
double nockyng is vsed for double suerty of the shaft

But the goose hath made vs flee to farre from oure
matter. Now sir ye haue hearde howe a fether must
be had, and that a goose fether onely. It foloweth of
a yong gose and an oulde, and the residue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>longing
to a fether: which thing I wyll shortlye course ouer:
wherof, when you knowe the properties, you maye
fitte your shaftes accordyng to your shotyng, which
rule you must obserue in all other thynges too, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no one fashion or quantitie can be fitte for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, nomore then a shooe or a cote can be. The
oulde goose fether is styffe and stronge, good for a
wynde, and fyttest for a deed shaft: the yonge goose
fether is weake and fyne, best for a swyfte shaft, and
it must be couled at the first shering, somewhat hye,
for with shoting, it wyll sattle and faule very moche.
The same thing (although not so moche) is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydered
in a goose and a gander. A fenny goose, euen
as her flesh is blacker, stoorer, vnholsomer, so is her
fether for the same cause courser stoorer &amp; rougher, &amp;
therfore I haue heard very good fletchers saye, that
the seconde fether in some place is better then the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in other some. Betwixt the winges is lytle dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
but that you must haue diuerse shaftes of one
flight, fethered with diuerse winges, for diuerse win<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des:
for if the wynde and the fether go both one way
the shaft wyl be caryed to moche. The pinion fether
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4601:75"/>
as it hath the firste place in the winge, so it hath the
fyrst place in good fetheringe. You maye knowe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be pared, by a bought whiche is in it, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
when it is colde, by the thinnesse aboue, and
the thicknesse at the grounde, and also by the stifnes
and finesse which wyll cary a shaft better, faster and
further, euen as a fine sayle cloth doth a shyppe.</p>
               <p>The coulour of the fether is leste to be regarded,
yet som what to be looked on: lest for a good whyte
you haue sometyme an yll greye. Yet surelye it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
with good reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue the cocke fether black
or greye, as it were to gyue a man warning to nocke
ryght. The cocke fether is called that which sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
aboue in right nocking, which if you do not obserue
the other fethers must nedes run on the bowe, and
so marre your shote. And thus farre of the goodnesse
and choyse of your fether: now foloweth the setting
on. Wherin you must looke that your fethers be not
drawen for hastinesse, but pared euen and streyghte
with diligence. The fletcher draweth a fether when
he hath but one swappe at it with his knyfe, and
then playneth it a lytle, with rubbynge it ouer his
knyfe. He pareth it when he taketh leysure and hede
to make euery parte of the ryb apt to stand streight,
and euen on vpon the stele. This thing if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take
not heede on, he maye chaunce haue cause to saye so
of his fletcher, as in dressinge of meate is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munelye
spoken of Cookes: and that is, that God sendeth vs
good fethers, but the deuyll noughtie Fletchers. Yf
any fletchers heard me saye thus, they wolde not be
angrye with me, except they were yll fletchers: and
<pb facs="tcp:4601:76"/>
yet by reason, those fletchers too, ought rather to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them selues for doing yll, then be angry with
me for saying truth. The ribbe in a styffe fether may
be thinner, for so it wyll stande cleaner on: but in a
weake fether you must leaue a thicker ribbe, or els yf
the ryb which is the foundacion and grounde, wher
in nature hath set euerye clefte of the fether, be taken
to nere the fether, it muste nedes folowe, that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall faule, &amp; droupe downe, euen as any herbe
doeth whyche hath his roote to nere taken on with
a spade. The lengthe and shortnesse of the fether,
serueth for diuers shaftes, as a long fether for a long
heauy, or byg shafte, the shorte fether for the contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry.
Agayne the shorte maye stande farther, the longe
nerer the nocke. Youre fether muste stande almooste
streyght on, but yet after that sorte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it maye turne
rounde in flyinge. And here I consider the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
nature of shootynge, whiche standeth all togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by that fashion, which is moste apte for quicke
mouynge, and that is by roundenesse. For firste the
bowe must be gathered rounde, in drawyng it must
come rounde compasse, the strynge muste be rounde
the stele rounde, the beste nocke rounde, the feather
shorne somwhat rounde, the shafte in slyenge, muste
turne rounde, and if it flye far, it flyeth a round com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace.
For eyther aboue or benethe a rounde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pace,
hyndereth the flyinge. Moreouer bothe the fletcher
in makynge your shafte, and you in nockynge your
shafte, muste take heede that two fethers equallye
runne on the bowe. For yf one fether runne alone on
the bowe, it shal quickely be worne, and shall not be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4601:76"/>
able to matche with the other fethers, and agayne
at the lowse, yf the shafte be lyght, it wyl starte, if it
be heuye, it wil hoble. And thus as concernyng set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
on of your fether. Nowe of coulynge.</p>

The swyne backed fashion, maketh the shaft deader,
for it gathereth more ayer than the saddle backed, &amp;
therfore the saddle backe is surer for daunger of we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp; fitter for smothe fliing. Agayn to shere a shaft

the triangle fashion, whyche is muche vsed nowe a

that he maye bothe knowe them and trust them

               <p>A chylde by thre thinges, is brought to excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
By Aptnesse, Desire, and Feare: Aptnesse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
hym pliable lyke waxe to be formed and fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
euen as a man woulde haue hym. Desyre to be
as good or better, than his felowes: and Feare of
them whome he is vnder, wyl cause hym take great
labour and payne with diligent hede, in learnynge
any thinge, wherof procedeth at the laste excellency
and perfectnesse.</p>
               <p>A man maye by wisdome in learnyng any thing,
and specially to shoote, haue thre lyke commodities
also, wherby he maye, as it were become younge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4601:81"/>
and so attayne to excellencie. For as a childe
is apte by naturall youth, so a man by vsyng at the
first weake bowes, far vnderneth his strength, shal
be as pliable and readye to be taught fayre shotyng
as any chylde: and daylye vse of the same, shal both
kepe hym in fayer shotyng, and also at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> last bryng
hym to stronge shootynge.</p>
               <p>And in stede of the feruente desyre, which prouoketh
a chylde to be better than hys felowe, lette a man be
as muche stirred vp with shamefastnes to be worse
than all other. And the same place that feare hathe
in a chylde, to compell him to take peyne, the same
hath loue of shotyng in a man, to cause hym forsake
no labour, withoute whiche no man nor chylde can
be excellent. And thus whatsoeuer a chylde may be
taught by Aptnesse, Desire, &amp; Feare, the same thing
in shootynge, maye a man be taughte by weake bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
Shamefastnesse and Loue.</p>
               <p>And hereby you maye se that that is true whiche
Cicero sayeth, that a man by vse, may be broughte
to a newe nature. And this I dare be bould to saye,
that any man whiche will wisely begynne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantlye

               <p>I can teache you to shoote fayre, euen as So
trates taught a man ones to knowe God, for when
he axed hym what was God: naye sayeth he I can
tell you better what God is not, as God is not yll,
God is vnspeakeable, vnsearcheable and so forth:
Euen lykewyse can I saye of fayre shootyng, it hath
not this discommodite with it nor that discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,
and at last a man maye so shifte all the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4601:83"/>
from shootynge that there shall be left no
thynge behynde but fayre shootynge. And to do this
the better you must remember howe that I toulde
you when I descrybed generally the hole nature of
shootyng that fayre shotyng came of these thynges,
of standynge, nockynge, drawynge, hewldynge and
lowsynge, the whych I wyll go ouer as shortly as
I can, describynge the discommodities that men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

vse in all partes of theyr bodies, that you yf
you faulte in any such maye knowe it &amp; so go about
to am end it. Faultes in Archers do excede the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Archers, whyche come wyth vse of shootynge
wythoute teachynge. Use and custome separated
from knowlege and learnynge, doth not onely hurt
shootynge, but the moost weyghtye thynges in the

those people whyche be the mayneteners of vses w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

mouthe but thys vse, vse, custome, custome. Suche
men more wylful than wyse, beside other discommo

And thys I speake generally of vse and custome.</p>
               <p>Whych thynge yf a learned man had it in hande y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
woulde applye it to any one matter, he myght han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
it wonderfullye. But as for shootyng, vse is the
onely cause of all fautes in it and therfore chylderne
more easly and soner maye be taught to shote excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlye
then men, bycause chylderne may be taught
to shoote well at the fyrste, men haue more payne to

               <p>A mayster of a shippe first learneth to knowe the

brode sayles, beyng glad to eschue as muche of the

to knowe the nature of the wynde, and with wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
wyll measure in hys mynde, howe muche it

wyll alter his shoote, eyther in lengthe kepynge, or

               <p>Therefore in shootynge there is as muche diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

and an other that knoweth and marketh nothynge,

muste firste learne to knowe the sure flyghte of

these thinges knowen, and euery shoote diligentlye

He that woulde knowe perfectly the winde and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
muste put differences betwixte tymes. For di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie

wyth the strength of man also. And to knowe that
this is so, is ynough for a shoter &amp; artillerie, and not
to serche the cause, why it shoulde be so: whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to a learned man and Philosophie.</p>
               <p>In consydering the tyme of the yeare, a wyse Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
wyll folowe a good Shipman. In Winter &amp;
rough wether, smal bootes and lytle pinkes forsake
the seas: And at one tyme of the yeare, no Gallies
come abrode: So lykewyse weake Archers, vsyng
small and holowe shaftes, with bowes of litle pith,
muste be content to gyue place for a tyme.</p>
               <p>And this I do not saye, eyther to disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
any weake shooter: For lykewyse, as there
is no shippe better than Gallies be, in a softe and a
caulme sea, so no man shooteth cumlier or nerer hys
marke, than some weake archers doo, in a fayre and
cleare daye.</p>
               <p>Thus euery archer must knowe, not onely what
bowe and shafte is fittest for him to shoote withall,
but also what tyme &amp; season is best for hym to shote
in. And surely, in al other matters to, amonge al de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

in a moystie day, stoppeth a shafte more than a good
whiskynge wynde in a clere daye. Yea, and I haue
sene whan there hath bene no winde at all, the ayer
so mistie and thicke, that both the markes haue ben
wonderfull great. And ones, whan the Plage was
in Cambrige, the downe winde twelue score marke
for the space of .iii. weekes, was .xiii. score, and an
halfe, and into the wynde, beynge not very great, a
great deale aboue .xiiii. score.</p>
               <p>The winde is sumtyme playne vp and downe,
whiche is commonly moste certayne, and requireth
least knowlege, wherin a meane shoter with meane
geare, if he can shoote home, maye make best shifte.
A syde wynde tryeth an archer and good gere verye
muche. Sumtyme it bloweth a lofte, sumtyme hard
by the grounde: Sumtyme it bloweth by blastes, &amp;
sumtyme it continueth al in one: Sumtyme ful side
wynde, sumtyme quarter with hym and more, and
lykewyse agaynst hym, as a man with castynge vp
lyght grasse, orels if he take good hede, shall sensibly
learne by experience. To se the wynde, with a man
his eyes, it is vnpossible, the nature of it is so fyne,
and subtile, yet this experience of the wynde had I
ones my selfe, and that was in the great snowe that
fell .iiii. yeares agoo: I rode in the hye waye betwirt
Topcliffe vpon Swale, and Borowe bridge, the
waye beyng sumwhat trodden afore, by waye fay,
rynge men. The feeldes on bothe sides were playne
and laye almost yearde depe with snowe, the nyght

and clere, the winde was whistelinge a lofte, and
sharpe accordynge to the tyme of the yeare. The
snowe in the hye waye laye lowse and troden wyth
horse feete: so as the wynde blewe, it toke the lowse
snow with it, and made it so slide vpon the snowe in
the felde whyche was harde and crusted by reason
of the frost ouer nyght, that therby I myght se ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
wel, the hole nature of the wynde as it blewe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
daye. And I had a great delyte &amp; pleasure to marke
it, whyche maketh me now far better to remember
it. Sometyme the wynd would be not past .ii. year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
brode, and so it would carie the snowe as far as
I coulde se. An other tyme the snow woulde blowe
ouer halfe the felde at ones. Sometyme the snowe
woulde tomble softly, by and by it would flye won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
fast. And thys I perceyued also that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wind
goeth by streames &amp; not hole togither. For I should
se one streame wyth in a Score on me, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the space
of .ii. score no snow would stirre, but after so muche
qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie of grounde, an other streame of snow at the
same very tyme should be caryed lykewyse, but not
equally. For the one would stande styll when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
flew a pace, and so contynewe somtyme swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer
sometime slowlyer, sometimebroder, sometime
narrower, as far as I coulde se. Nor it flewe not
streight, but sometyme it crooked thys waye some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
that waye, and somtyme it ran round aboute
in a compase. And somtyme the snowe wold be lyft
clene from the ground vp in to the ayre, and by &amp; by
it would be al clapt to the grounde as though there
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4601:92"/>
had bene no winde at all, streightway it woulde rise
and flye agayne.</p>
               <p>And that whych was the moost meruayle of al,
at one tyme .ii. driftes of snowe flewe, the one out of
the West into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> East, the other out of the North in

the one crosse ouer the other, as it had bene two hye
wayes. And agayne I shoulde here the wynd blow
in the ayre, when nothing was stirred at the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
And when all was still where I rode, not verye far
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me the snow should be lifted wonderfully. This
experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce made me more meruaile at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nature of the

are required to kepe a iust length. But to go forward
the nexte poynte after the markyng of your wether,
is the takyng of your standyng. And in a side winde
you must stand sumwhat crosse in to the wynde, for
so shall you shoote the surer. Whan you haue taken

it haue had any strype, at the laste shoote. A stripe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
a stone, many tymes will bothe marre the head,

               <p>No trewlye. And fyrste I wyll tel you what
shyftes Archers haue founde to shoote streyght, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
what is the best waye to shoote streyght. As the we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
belongeth specially to kepe a lengthe (yet a side
winde belongeth also to shote streight) euen so the
nature of the pricke is to shote streight. The lengthe
or shortnesse of the marke is alwayes vnder the rule
of the wether, yet sumwhat there is in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> marke, wor
thye to be marked of an Archer. Yf the prickes stand
of a streyght playne grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> best to shote at.
Yf y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> marke sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on a hyl syde or y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d be vnequal
 w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pittes &amp; turninge wayes betwyxte the markes, a
mans eye shall thynke that to be streight whyche is
croked: The experience of this thing is sene in pay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge,
the cause of it is knowen by learnynge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4601:95"/>
And it is ynoughe for an archer to marke it and take
hede of it. The cheife cause why men can not shoote
streight, is bicause they loke at theyr shaft: and this
fault commeth bycause a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not taught to shote
when he is yong. Yf he learne to shoote by himselfe
he is a frayde to pull the shafte throughe the bowe,
and therfore looketh alwayes at hys shafte: yll vse
confirmeth thys faulte as it doth many mo.</p>
               <p>And men continewe the longer in thys faulte
bycause it is so good to kepe a lengthe wyth al, and
yet to shote streight, they haue inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted some waies.
to espie a tree or a hill beyonde the marke, or elles to
haue su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me notable thing betwixt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> markes: &amp; ones
I sawe a good archer whiche did caste of his gere, &amp;
layd his quiuer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it, euen in the midway betwixt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
prickes. Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me thought he dyd so, for sauegarde of
his gere: I suppose he did it, to shoote streyght w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>all.
Other men vse to espie su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me marke almoost a bow
wide of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pricke, and than go about to kepe him selfe
on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hande that the prycke is on, which thing howe
muche good it doth, a man wil not beleue, that doth
not proue it. Other &amp; those very good archers in dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng,
loke at the marke vntill they come almost to
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> head, than they looke at theyr shafte, but at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> very
lowse, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a seconde sight they fynde theyr marke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.
This way &amp; al other afore of me rehersed are
but shiftes &amp; not to be folowed in shotyng streyght.
For hauyng a mans eye alwaye on his marke, is the
only waye to shote streght, yea &amp; I suppose so redye
&amp; easy a way yf it be learned in youth &amp; confirmed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
vse, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> a man shal neuer misse therin. Men doubt yet i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:4601:95"/>
lokig at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mark what way is best whether betwixt
the bowe &amp; the stringe, aboue or beneth hys hand,
&amp; many wayes moo: yet it maketh no great matter
which way a man looke at his marke yf it be ioyned
 w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> comly shotynge. The diuersite of mens standyng
and drawing causeth diuerse me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loke at theyr marke
diuerse wayes: yet they al lede a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hand to shoote
streight yf nothyng els stoppe. So that cumlynesse
is the only iudge of best lokyng at the marke. Some
men wonder why in casting a mans eye at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> marke,
the hande should go streyght. Surely yf he consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the nature of a mans eye, he wolde not wonder
at it: For this I am cerrayne of, that no seruaunt to
hys mayster, no chylde to hys father is so obedient,
as euery ioynte and pece of the body is to do what
soeuer the eye biddes. The eye is the guide, the ruler
&amp; the succourer of al the other partes. The ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, the
foote &amp; other members dare do nothynge w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the
eye, as doth appere on the night and darke corners.
The eye is the very tonge wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyt &amp; reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth
speke to euery parte of the body, &amp; the wyt doth not
so sone signifye a thynge by the eye, as euery part is
redye to folow, or rather preuent the byddyng of the
eye. Thys is playne in many thinges, but most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in fence and feyghtynge, as I haue heard men
saye. There euery part standynge in feare to haue a
blowe, runnes to the eye for helpe, as yonge chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
do to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mother: the foote, the hand, &amp; al wayteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the eye. Yf the eye byd y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d either beare of, or sinite,
or the foote ether go forward, or backeward, it doth
so: And that whyche is moost wonder of all the one

man lookynge stedfastly at the other mans eye and
not at his hand, wyl, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were, rede in his eye
where he purposeth to smyte next, for the eye is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
els but a certayne wyndowe for wit to shote
oute hir hede at.</p>
               <p>Thys wonderfull worke of god in makynge all
the members so obedient to the eye, is a pleasaunte
thynge to remember and loke vpon: therfore an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
maye be sure in learnyng to looke at hys marke
when he is yong, alwayes to shoote streyghte. The
thynges that hynder a man whyche looketh at hys
marke, to shoote streyght, be these: A syde wynde, a
bowe either to stronge, or els to weake, an ill arme,
whan a fether runneth on the bowe to much, a byg
brested shafte, for hym that shoteth vnder hande, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it wyll hobble: a litle brested shafte for hym y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
shoteth aboue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hande, bicause it myl starte: a payre
of windynge prickes, and many other thinges mo,
which you shal marke your selfe, &amp; as ye knowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
so learne to amend them. If a man woulde leaue to
looke at his shafte, and learne to loke at his marke,
he maye vse this waye, whiche a good shooter tolde
me ones that he did. Let him take his bowe on the
nyght, and shoote at .ii. lightes, and there he shall be
compelled to looke alwayes at his marke, &amp; neuer at
his shafte: This thing ones or twyse vsed wyl cause
hym forsake lokynge at hys shafte. Yet let hym take
hede of settynge his shaft in the bowe.</p>
               <p>Thus Philologe to shoote streyght is the leaste
maysterie of all, yf a manne order hym selfe thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in hys youthe. And as for kepynge a lengthe, I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4601:96"/>
am sure the rules whiche I gaue you, wil neuer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
you, so that there shal lacke nothynge, eyther
of hittinge the marke alwayes, or elles verye nere
shotynge, excepte the faulte be onely in youre owne
selfe, whiche maye come .ii. wayes, eyther in hauing
a faynt harte or courage, or elles in sufferynge your
selfe ouer muche to be led with affection: yf a mans
mynde fayle hym, the bodye whiche is ruled by the
mynde, can neuer doe his duetie, yf lacke of courage
were not, men myght do mo mastries than they do,
as doeth appere in leapynge and vaultinge.</p>
               <p>All affections and specially anger, hurteth bothe
mynde and bodye. The mynde is blynde therby: and
yf the mynde be blynde, it can not rule the bodye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.
The body both blood and bone, as they say, is
brought out of his ryght course by anger: Wherby
a man lacketh his right strengthe, and therfore can
not shoote wel. Yf these thynges be auoyded (wher
of I wyll speake no more, both bycause they belong
not properly to shoting, &amp; also you can teache me bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
