            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously bethought my selfe in what doctrine especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to imply my Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:16683:3"/>
in the place in which the Lord had by so strong and strange a prouidence settled me: Amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things I was vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently inclined to study the Cure of the Feare of Death; both because it may be vsually obserued, that the most men are in bondage by reason of these feares; as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am assured, that ourliues wil become more sweet; yea, and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, when the feare of death is remoued: And the rather was I incited hereunto, because I haue obserued some defect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:16683:3"/>
this point, in the most that haue written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Death. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the censure, which many may giue of this proiect, as accounting it an impossible thing to be effected; but my trust is, that godly and discreet Christians will restraine censure, when they haue throughly viewed my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>My vnsaigned desire to do seruice vnto GODS Church in releeuing such Christians herein, as are not furnished with better helps, hath emboldned me to offer this Treatise
<pb facs="tcp:16683:4"/>
also to the publike view: I haue presumed in your Honours absence to thrust forth this Treatise vnder the protection of your Honours name: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I desire heartily to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my thankefulnesse for the many fauours shewed vnto me and mine, while your Honour was pleased to be my Hearer. I should also much reioyce, if my testimony (concerning the singular graces God hath bestowed vpon you, and the many good works in which you haue aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the places of your aboad) might adde any
<pb facs="tcp:16683:4"/>
thing, either vnto your Honours praises in the Churches of Christ, or vnto the establishment of the comfort of your owne heart in God, and his Son Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>I haue not made choise of your Honour in this Dedication for any speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fitnesse in this Treatise; for your Honours condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in respect of your age, or absence in a place so farre remote. For my earnest trust is, that God will adde yet many yeares to your happy life on earth; and besides I haue had heeretofore occasion
<pb facs="tcp:16683:5"/>
to know how little you were afraid to die, when the Lord did seeme to summon you by sicknes.</p>
            <p>That God, which hath ennobled your heart with heauenly gifts, &amp; so made you an instrument of so much good, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnto that most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Princesse, with whom you now liue, and towards whom you haue shewed so much faithfull obseruance, and dearenes of affection, and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of attendance: Euen the Father of mercy, and God of all consolations, increase in you all spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

blessings, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ioy of your heart, and make you still to grow in acceptation, and all well-doing: Humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pardon for my bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse heerein: I commit your Honour to God, and to the word of his Grace, which will build you vp to eternall life: resting</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THAT, which I intend in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, is to shew, how a godly man might order <note place="margin">The drift of the whole Treatise.</note> himselfe against the feare of death; or, what course hee should take to liue so,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16683:13"/>
as not to be afraid to die. This is a maine point, and exceeding necessary: Life is throughly sweet, when <note place="margin">The profit of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these directions</note> death is not feared: a mans heart is then like <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> that cannot be moued. Hee can feare no enemy, that doth not feare death. As death is the last enemy, so it works the longest and last feares; and to die happily, is to die willingly. The maine worke of Preparation is effected, when our hearts are perswaded to bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die.</p>
               <p>Now in the explication <note place="margin">The parts of the Treatise.</note> of this point, I would
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16683:13"/>
distinctly handle three things.</p>
               <p>First, I will proue, that to liue without feare of <note place="margin">1</note> death, is a thing may bee obtained; one may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from it as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a sick man may bee cured of an ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will shew, how vncomely a thing it <note place="margin">2</note> is for a Christian to bee afraid of death: that so we may bee stirred vp the more to seeke the cure for this disease.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I will shew by what meanes we may bee <note place="margin">3</note> deliuered from the feare
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16683:14"/>
of death, if we vse them. Of the two first more briefly: and of the last at large.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Prouing that we may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the feare of death.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOR the first: that the feare of death may be remoued; and that we may <note place="margin">Eight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to proue we may be helped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the feare of death.</note> attaine to that resolution to be willing to die, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lothnesse, is apparant diuers waies.</p>
               <p>First, it is euident: <hi>Christ</hi> died to deliuer vs, not onely from the hurt of death, and from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16683:14"/>
as the executioner: but also from the feare of death too. Now Christ may attaine to the end of his death, vnlesse we will deny the vertue of Christ, and his death, and think that notwithstanding it cannot be obtained, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. And the more apparant is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in that place hee shewes, that there is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the death of Christ, to cure this feare of death in any of the Elect, if they will vse the meanes: For as our sinnes will not bee mortified, though there be power in the death of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16683:15"/>
Christ to kill them; vnlesse wee vse the meanes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this vertue out of the death of Christ: so is it true, that the feare of death may be in some of Gods Elect: but it is not because Christ cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them; but because they are sluggish, and will not take the course to bee rid of those feares. The Physician is able to cure them, and vsually doth cure the same disease; but they will not take his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apostle intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the desire of death, saith, <hi>That God hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16683:15"/>
wrought vs vnto the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same thing, 2. Cor.</hi> 5. 5. We are againe created of God, that wee might in our selues aspire vnto im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; and are set in such an estate, as if we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the end of his workemanship, we should neuer be well, till wee be possessed of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in another world: which hee shewes in those words of <hi>being absent from the body, and present with the Lord, ver.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prophesies haue run on this point. For it was long since fore-told, that Christians knowing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16683:16"/>
the victory of Christ ouer death, should be so farre from fearing death, that they should treade vpon him, and insult ouer him: <hi>O Death, Where is thy sting? &amp;c. Isay 25. 8. Hos. 13. 14. 2. Cor.</hi> 15. 54, 55.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a condition, that Christ puts in, when he first admits Disciples, that they must deny their owneliues: and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be content to take vp their crosse in other things, but their liues must not bee deare vnto them, when hee cals for it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 26.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wee are taught in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16683:16"/>
the Lords Prayer, to pray <hi>That Gods Kingdome may come:</hi> And by his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he meanes the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory, as well as the Kingdome of Grace: Now in that wee are taught to pray for the Kingdome, it shewes wee should desire it, and that by prayer wee should bee more and more heated in our desires.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wee are <hi>borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to a liuely hope of our inheritance:</hi> Now if wee bee afraid of the time of our translation thither, how do we hope for it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a liuely manner? A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16683:17"/>
of going to heauen is a part of that seed cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts in our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Wee haue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of diuers men in particular, who haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to die, and were out of feare in that respect: <hi>Gen. 49. 18. Iacob wayted for Gods saluation:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> resolues, that to die, and to <hi>be with Christ, is best of all for him: Phil.</hi> 1. 21. Yea, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. hee is vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer mee from this body of death? Simeon</hi> praies God to let him die, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 29. And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16683:17"/>
the Prophet in the name of the godly, said long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ: <hi>O that the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of Israel were come out of Syon, Psal.</hi> 14. 7. And we haue the example of the Martyrs in all Ages, that accounted it a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar glory to die: And in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2, 7. the godly are said <hi>to sigh for it,</hi> that they might <hi>bee absent from the body, and present with the Lord;</hi> and so do the <hi>first fruites of the Holy Ghost,</hi> those eminent Christians mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21.</p>
               <p>Lastly: not onely some particular godly men haue attained to this; but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16683:18"/>
the whole Church is brought in, in the 22. Ch. of the <hi>Reu.</hi> praying for the comming of Iesus Christ, and desiring too, that hee would <hi>come quickly:</hi> And 2. <hi>Tim. 4. 8. The loue of the appearing of Christ,</hi> is the <hi>Periphrasis</hi> of the childe of God.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>FOR the second, how vncomely a thing it is in Christians to feare
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16683:18"/>
death, may appeare many waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the feare of death wee shame our Religion; while we professe it in our words, wee deny it in our workes: Let <hi>Papists</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at death, who are <note place="margin">Fifteeene Reasons why it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely thing to be afraid to die.</note> taught, that no man ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily can be sure he shall go to heauen when he dies. But for vs; that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the knowledge of saluation, to be astonished at the passage to it, shews (at least) a great weaknesse of faith, and doth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly giue occasion of disgrace to our Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By that, which went
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16683:19"/>
before, we may see how vncomely it is to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of death: For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we disable the death of Christ: wee frustrate the end of Gods workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: we stop the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophesies: we renounce our first agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Christ: wee mocke God in praying that his Kingdome may come: we obscure the euidence of our owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; and we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse against the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the godly in all ages.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Many of the Pagans greatly setled their hearts
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16683:19"/>
against the feare of death by this very reason: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was no being after death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could no more feele misery then, then before they were borne: And shall we Christians, that heare euery day of the glorious saluation we haue by Christ, be more fearefull then they were? Let them feare death, that know not a better life.</p>
               <p>Shall we be like wicked men? Their death is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Shall ours bee so too? They by their good wils, would not lose their bodies in this life, nor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16683:20"/>
haue their bodies in the next life: But since God hath made vs vnlike them in the issues of death; Shal we make our selues like them in the lothnesse to die? Let <hi>Foelix</hi> tremble at the doctrine of death and iudgement: <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. But let all the godly hold vp their heads, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the day of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption draweth nigh, <hi>Math.</hi> 24, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Shall wee bee afraid of a shadow? The separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the soule from God, that is death, if wee speake exactly: but the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the soule from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16683:20"/>
the body, is but <hi>the shadow of death.</hi> VVhen see wee men trembling for feare of spirituall death? which is called the First Death; and yet this is farre more wofull then that wee call the bodily death. But as if the death of the body were nothing, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cals Damnation, The second death, neuer put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the other into the number.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This feare is called a bondage here in this text: And shall wee voluntarily make our selues Vassailes? Or shall we be like slaues, that dare not come in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16683:21"/>
our Masters sight?</p>
               <p n="7">7. If we loue long life: VVhy are wee not much more in loue with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, where the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is longer, and the estate happier? Are not wee extremely infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that when God will do better for vs, then wee desire, yet we wil be afraid of him?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Shall we bee worse then children, or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? neither of them feare death; And shall sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, or Ideotisme, doe more with them, then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Religion can doe with vs?</p>

                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:16683:21"/>
9. Do not all that reade the Story of the Israelites (in their passion desiring to be againe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and violently murmuring at the promise of going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land of <hi>Canaan)</hi> condemne them of vile ingratitude to God, and folly in respect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues? For what was it for them to liue in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but to serue cruell <hi>Taske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters about bricke and clay?</hi> And was not <hi>Canaan</hi> the place of their <hi>rest,</hi> and <hi>a Land that flowed with milke and hony?</hi> Euen such is the condition of all those, that wish Life, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16683:22"/>
are afraid to Die. What is this <hi>world</hi> but <hi>Egypt,</hi> and what is it <hi>to Liue</hi> in this world, but <hi>to serue about bricke and clay?</hi> Yea, <hi>the Church,</hi> that is separate from the world, can finde it no better then a <hi>Barren Wildernesse.</hi> And what is <hi>Heauen,</hi> but a <hi>Spirituall Canaan?</hi> And what can Death be more, then to passe ouer <hi>Iordan;</hi> and victoriously ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming all enemies, to bee posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of a place of match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse rest; of more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures then Milk or Hony, can shadow out?</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Adam</hi> might haue
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16683:22"/>
had more reason to feare Death, that neuer saw a man die an ordinary Death; but for vs to bee afrighted with Death, that see thousands die at our right hand, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand at our left, and that daily, is an inexcusable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper. The gate of Death is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually open, and wee see a prease of people, that daily throng into it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. When <hi>Moses</hi> had cast downe <hi>his Rod, it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a Serpent;</hi> and the Text, noting <hi>Moses</hi> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, saith, <hi>Hee fled from it:</hi> But <hi>the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:16683:23"/>
                  <hi>him to take it by the Taile; and behold, it became a Rod againe:</hi> Euen so Death at the first sight is terrible, like a new-made Serpent, and the godly themselues, through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration, flye from it: But if at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, without feare, they would lay hold vpon this seeming Serpent, it will be turned into a Rod againe; yea, into a golden Scepter in our hands, made much better by the change: Neither do wee reade, that euer at any after, <hi>Moses</hi> had any feare of this Serpent, when hee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16683:23"/>
had once knowne the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it: And haue wee often, by the eyes of faith, seene the experience of this great worke of God, and shall we still be running away?</p>
               <p n="12">12. It is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20. that <hi>all creatures groane, waiting for the liberty of the sonnes of God.</hi> And shall wee bee worse then bruite beasts? Doth the whole frame of nature, as it were, call for this time of change; and shall man bee so stupide, or carried with such senselesse feares, as to shunne his owne felicity?</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:16683:24"/>
13. Consider whether it bee more commodious for vs, that Death come to vs, or that wee goe to Death: For one thing is certaine; It is in vaine to shun that, which cannot bee auoided. For <hi>it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto all men once to die,</hi> Heb. 9. 24. <hi>What man is he, that liueth, and shall not see death? Psal. 89. Death is the way of all flesh, Iosh.</hi> 24. Now this being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, let vs consider of it, Death is like an armed man, with whom we must once fight. Now if we be aduised &amp; wil go to death, wee may get on our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16683:24"/>
beforehand, and so the encounter wil be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger to vs, because <hi>the weapons of our warfare are mighty through God,</hi> &amp; wee are assured of <hi>victorie through Iesus Christ.</hi> Now on the other side, to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry till Death come vnto vs, is as if a man that knowes he must fight with a sore Aduersary, would through slothfulness, goe vp and downe vnarmed, till hee fall into the hands of his enemy: &amp; must thou fight with him at such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage?</p>
               <p n="14">14. It is most vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feare that, which is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16683:25"/>
both common and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: death, of all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is most common. For from other afflictions it is possible some might bee free: but from Death can no man be deliuered, and GOD of purpose hath made that most common which is most grieuous, that thereby hee might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the vigor, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of it. It is monstrous foolishnesse to striue in vaine to auoid that which neuer man could scape. And to teach men their vnauoidable mortalitie, the Lord clothed our first Parents with the skinnes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16683:25"/>
of dead beastes, and feeds vs with dead flesh: that as often as wee eate of slaine beasts, we might remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our owne end: &amp; shall we be euer learning, and neuer come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this truth? Is this such a lesson as cannot be learned? shall wee bee so stupide, as daily to passe by the graues of the dead, and heare their knells, and yet bee vntaught and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed?</p>
               <p n="15">15. Lastly, shall we be afraid of such an enemy as hath been ouercome hand to hand, &amp; beaten by Christ, and thousands
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16683:26"/>
of the Saints? especially if we consider the assurance wee haue of victory. In this combate euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may triumph before the victory, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the two first points.</p>

               <p>NOW I come to the third point, which is the maine thing to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and that is the meanes how wee may be cured of the feare of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16683:26"/>
Death: and in this we had neede all to attend vvith great carefulnesse. The disease is stubborne, and <note place="margin">An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the meanes of cure.</note> men are sluggish, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely loth to bee at the trouble of the cure, and Sathan by all meanes would keepe vs from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring our later end; and the world affoordes daily distractions to pluck vs away from the schoole of Christ herein, and our owne hearts are deceitful, and our natures apt to bee wearie of the doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we put in practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the directions; and wee are apt to a thousand
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16683:27"/>
conceits, that it is either vnpossible, or vnnecessary to attend this doctrine, or the like. Yea, it may be, it will fare with many of vs, as it doth with those that are troubled with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging paine of the teeth, their paine wil cease, when the Barber comes to pull out the tooth: so it may be you may finde this deceit in your owne hearts, that you wil not feele the feare of Death, till the discourse of the medicine be ouer, and so let it bee as water spilt on the ground. But let vs all awake, and in the power and strength of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16683:27"/>
Christ, that died to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from the feare of death, let vs al lay the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters close to the sore, and keepe them at it, till they be throughly whole.</p>
               <p>There bee tvvo vvaies <note place="margin">Two waies of curing the feare of death.</note> then of curing this feare of Death: 1. The one is by contemplation: 2. The other is by practice. There be some things if we did chuse them out soundly to thinke of them, would heale vs wonderfully.</p>
               <p>There bee some things also to be done by vs, to make the cure perfect. If contemplation bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailable, then practice will
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16683:28"/>
without faile finish the cure.</p>
               <p>The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templations are of two sorts: 1. For either <note place="margin">The wayes of curing this feare by conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</note> they are such meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as breede desire of Death by way of motiue: 2. Or they are such, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue the obiections, which cause in mans mind the feare of Death. For the first, there bee tvvo things, which if they bee soundly thought on, will worke a strange alteration in our harts. 1. The one is the happinesse wee haue by Death. 2. The other, is the miseries wee are in by Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:16683:28"/>
Can any man be afraid to be happy? If our heads &amp; hearts were filled with arguments, that shew vs our happinesse by Death, we would not be so sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse as to tremble at the thought of dying.</p>
               <p>Our happines in Death may bee set out in many particulars, &amp; illustrated by many similitudes, full of life and vertue, to heale this disease of feare.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Death makes an end of all the tempests &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <note place="margin">The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines of a Christian in death shewed 17. wayes.</note> stormes, with which our life is tossed.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16683:29"/>
desire the continuance of such dangerous tempests, rather then to bee in the hauen whither our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney tends?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Death is a sleep. For so the dead are said to be asleep, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 14.

And was euer the weary labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer afraid of the time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee must lye downe, and take his rest?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The day of Death,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16683:29"/>

17. <hi>Iohn 14. 2. Heb.</hi> 13. 11. And can we bee so sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less as to be afraid of this?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Death is our birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; we say falsely, when we call Death the last day. For it is indeed the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an euerlasting day: and is there any gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance in that?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Death is the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of our vices, and the resurrection of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Death was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sinne, and in death shall that be fulfilled: <hi>The daughter shall destroy the mother.</hi> Wee shall neuer more be infected with sin, nor troubled with ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16683:31"/>
nor be terrified for offending. Death shall <note place="margin">The disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the body, is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the soule.</note> deliuer vs perfectly whole of all our diseases, that were impossible to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this life, and so shal there be at that day a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious resurrection of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Our gifts shall shine, as the Starres in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament; And can we be so sottish as stil to be afraid of Death?</p>
               <p n="8">8. In death the soule is deliuered out of prison: For the body in this life is but a loathsome, and darke prison of restraint. I say, the soule is restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it were, in a prison,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16683:31"/>
while it is in the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot be free to the exercise of it selfe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in naturall, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall things: For the body so rules by senses, and is so fiercely carried by appetites, that the soule is compelled to giue way to the satisfying of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and cannot freely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the light either of Nature or Religion: <hi>The truth,</hi> as the Apostle saith, <hi>is with-held,</hi> or shut vp, <hi>through vnrighteousnesse, Rom.</hi> 1. 18. I say, it is <hi>a loathsome prison,</hi> because the soule is annoied with so many loathsome smels
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16683:32"/>
of sinne, and filthinesse, which by the body are committed. And it is <hi>a darke prison;</hi> For the soule looking through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, can see but by little holes, or small casements. The body shuts vp the light of the soule, as a dark Cloude doth hide the light of the Sunne; or as the interposition of the earth doth make it night: Now death doth nothing, but as it were a strong wind dissolue this Cloud, that the Sunne may shine cleerely, and puls downe the walles of the prison, that the soule may come
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16683:32"/>
into the open light.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The liberty of the soule in death may be set out by another similitude. The world is the Sea: our liues are like so many Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies at Sea, tost with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Tides, or Stormes: our bodies are Gally-slaues, put to hard seruice by the great Turke the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, who tyrannically, and by vsurpation, doth forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand hard things. Now the soule within, like the heart of some ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gally-slaue, may bee free, so as to loathe that seruitude, and inwardly detest that tyrant; but yet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16683:33"/>
so long as it is tyed to the body, it cannot get away. Now death comes like an vnresistable Gyant, and carries the Gallies to the shore, and dissolues them, and lets the prisoners free: And shall this glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the soule bee a matter of terrour vnto vs? Had we rather be in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity still?</p>
               <p n="10">10. In this life wee are cloathed with rotten, rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, foule garments: Now the Apostle shewes, that death doth nothing else but pull off those ragged garments, and cloath vs with the glorious robes of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16683:33"/>
saluation; more rich then the robes of the greatest Monarch, 2. <hi>Cor. Chap. 5. Vers.</hi> 2, 3. It is true, that the godly haue some kinde of desire <hi>to be cloathed vpon:</hi> They would haue those new garments, without pulling off their old; But that is not decent: for a Prince to weare (without) gorgeous attire, and (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath) base ragges. To desire to goe to heauen, and not to die, is to desire to put on our new cloaths without putting off our old: and is it any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance to shift vs by laying aside our old cloathes, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16683:34"/>
put on such rich gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? We are iust like such slothfull persons, that loue well to haue good cloaths, and cleane lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen: but they are so slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish, they are loth to put off their old cloathes, or foule linnen.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In the same place the Apostle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pares our bodies to an old mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walled house, and to a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Tent: and our estate in heauen to a most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Princely Palace, made by the most curious Workman that euer was; and it is such a building too, as wil neuer be out of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16683:34"/>
repaire. Now for a godly man to die, is but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue from a rotten old house, ready to fall on his head, to a sumptuous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. Doth that Land-lord do his Tenant wrong, or offer him hard measure, that will haue him out of his base Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, &amp; bestow vpon him his owne Mansion house? No other thing doth God to vs, when by Death he remoues vs out of this earthly Tabernacle of our bodies, to settle vs in those euerlasting habitations, euen into that building made without hands, in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16683:35"/>
heauen, <hi>Ioh. 14. 2. Luk.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p n="12">12. A man, that had neuer seene the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, perhaps would haue thought, that the seed cast into the ground had beene spoyled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it would rot there: but Nature hauing shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the returne of that graine with aduantage, a man can easily bee cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of that folly: The Husbandman is neuer so simple, as to pitty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or his seed; he sayes not, Alas, is it not pitty to throw away and marre this good seed? Why bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; what are our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16683:35"/>
but like the best graine? The bodies of the Saints are Gods choisest corne. And what doth Death more vnto Gods Graine, then cast it into the earth? Do we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, our bodies shall rise like the graine, better then euer they were sowed? and are we still afraid?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he would be <hi>dissolued, that hee might be with Christ, Phil.</hi> 1. 21. In which words hee imports two things in death. First, that there is a dissolution of the soule from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and secondly, that there is a coniunction of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16683:36"/>
the soule with Christ. Now which is better for vs, to haue the body, or to haue Christ? The same Apostle saith else-where, that they are <hi>confident in this, they had rather be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the body, and so to be present with the Lord:</hi> then to bee present with the body, and absent from the Lord: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Now the true reason why men feare death, is, because they looke vpon the dissolution onely, and not vpon the coniunction with Christ.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. our life is compared to a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16683:36"/>
race, and eternall life to a rich prize not corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but an incorruptible Crowne: Now death is the end of the race, and to die is but to come to the goale, or race end. Was euer runner so foolish, as to bee sorry, that with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory hee was neere the end of the race? And are we afraid of death, that shall end the toile, and sweate, and danger of the running; and giue vs with endlesse applause so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?</p>
               <p n="15">15. In the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law, there was a yeare
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16683:37"/>
they called the yeere of <hi>Iubilee;</hi> and this was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an acceptable yeare, because euery man that had lost, or sold his Lands, vpon the blowing of a Trumpet returned, and had possession of all againe; and so was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in which he liued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In this life wee are like the poore men of <hi>Israel,</hi> that haue lost our inheritance, and liue in a manner and condition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way straightned: now Death is our <hi>Iubilee,</hi> and when the Trumpet of death blowes, we all, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16683:37"/>
die, returne, and enioy a better estate, then euer we sold, or lost: Shall the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee</hi> be called an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time? And shall not our <hi>Iubilee</hi> bee acceptable to vs? <hi>Esay</hi> 61. 2.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Death is the day of our Coronation; wee are heires apparant to the Crowne in this life: yea, wee are Kings Elect, but cannot bee crowned, till death, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. And shall not that make vs loue the appearing of Christ? Is a King afraid of the day of his Coronation?</p>
               <p>To conclude this first part of Contemplation:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16683:38"/>
If we did seriously set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the glory to come; could our eyes be so dazeled, as not to see, and admire, and haste to it? Aske <hi>Paul,</hi> that was in heauen, what he saw; and hee will tell you, <hi>Things that cannot hee vttered:</hi> Happinesse beyond all language of mortall man. If there were as much faith on earth, as there is glory in heauen: oh! how would our hearts bee on fire with feruent desires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it!

these seruile and sottish feares.</p>
               <p>And thus of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, taken from the happinesse wee enioy by death: which should make vs conclude with <hi>Salomon,</hi>

I will giue but a briefe touch of some heads of them.</p>
               <p>First, thinke of thy sins:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16683:39"/>
and so three dreadfull <note place="margin">Three dreadfull considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout sin.</note> things may amaze thy thoughts: For first, thou art guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne; For <hi>by that man sinne came in vpon all men,</hi> euen the guilt of his sinne: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. Secondly, thy nature is <hi>altogether vile, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable from thy birth, thou wast conceiued in sinne, Psal.</hi> 51. 4. And this staine and leprosie <hi>hangs on fast</hi> vpon thy nature, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee cured, but by the bloud of Christ onely, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. And this is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all the faculties of thy soule: For in thy mind there is ignorance, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16683:40"/>
impotency to receiue knowledge; and a naturall approuing of euill and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, rather then the truth and sound doctrine. Those waies seeme good in thine eyes, which tend vnto death: 1. <hi>Cor. 2. 14. Rom. 8. 7. 2. Cor. 3. 5. Prou.</hi> 14. 12. And this thou maist perceiue by this, that thou art not able to thinke a good thought, but canst go free for daies and weekes, without any holy cogitation; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, thy minde is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely prone to swarmes of euill thoughts: <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
               <p>Againe, if thou behold
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16683:40"/>
thy conscience, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, polluted, without light, or life, or glory in thee, shut vp in a dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, excusing thee in many faultes, and accusing thee for things are not faultes, but in thy conceit: and when it doth accuse thee for sinne, it rageth &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth mad with vnbrideled fury and terrors, keeping no boundes of hope or mercy.</p>
               <p>Further, if thou obserue thy affections, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impotent in that which is good, there is no lust in thee after that which is good, &amp; yet they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16683:41"/>
are all out of order, and prone to continuall rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against God, ready to be fiered by all the intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, or the Deuill: <hi>Phil. 2. 13. Gala.</hi> 5. 24. Thirdly, vnto these, adde thy innumerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sins, which are more then the haires of thy head, multiplied daily in thought, affection, word, &amp; deed, the least of them deseruing hel fire for euer, thy sins of <hi>Infancy, youth, old-age,</hi> sinnes of <hi>omission</hi> and <hi>commission:</hi> sinnes in prosperitie and aduersity; sinnes at home &amp; abroad; sinnes of infirmity &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16683:41"/>
If <hi>Dauid</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon his sins, could say, <hi>They haue so compassed mee, and taken such hold of me, that I am not able to looke vp?</hi> Oh then, if thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sight, and sence! how might'st thou much more cry out of the intolerable burthen of them; and the rather, if thou obserue, that many of thy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raigne tyrannically, &amp; haue subdued thy life to their vassalage, so as thou art in continuall slauery to them.</p>
               <p>Thus is thy life infested with these vnspeakable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinations: and thus of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16683:42"/>
the first part of thy infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, but how God hath auenged himselfe vpon them, &amp; what yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto thee, how can thy heart sustaine it selfe? For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thou art a banished man, exiled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="3">3. Look vpon thy most miserable soule; for there thy mind and conscience liue shut vp with darknes and horror. The Diuels haue within thee strong holds, and liue entrenched in thy thoughts, <hi>Eph. 4. 17. 2. Cor.</hi> 10. 5. Thy heart is spiritually dead, and like a stone within thee, <hi>Eph. 2. 1.

               <p n="5">5. If thou looke vpon thy outward estate in the world, with what feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full frights may thy heart

be griped? If thou consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</p>

               <p>Lastly, consider yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what may fall vpon thee, in respect of which thou art in daily danger. There are seas of vvrath, which hang ouer thy

               <p>NOW the miseries of the godly mans life are of two sorts: first, for either he may consider what hee wants: secondly, or what he hath in life, for which he should be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it.</p>
               <p>I will giue but a touch of the first. Consider of it: in this life there are sixe things, among the rest, we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16683:46"/>
want, and can neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, while we liue here.</p>
               <p>The first, is the glorious presence of God, while <note place="margin">Six things euery godly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wants, while hee liues here in this world.</note> 
                  <hi>the body is present, the Lord is absent, 2. Cor.</hi> 5. 8. And is not this enough to make vs loath life? Shal we more esteeme this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Carkasse, then our glorious God: whose one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly presence in glory shall fill vs with eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? O the Vision of God! If we had but once seene God face to face, we would abhorre that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence that should hinder the fruition of such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable beauties, as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16683:46"/>
would enamour the most secure heart to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable loue.</p>
               <p>The second thing we want in life, is the sweet fellowship with our best friends: A fellowship matchlesse; if we either consider the perfection of the creatures, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion we shall enioy; or the perfect manner of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying it: Who would be with-held from <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the first-borne, from the society with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Angels, and the Spirits of iust men?</hi> Alas! the most of vs haue not so much, as one intire and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16683:47"/>
perfect friend in all the world, and yet we make such friends, as we haue, the ground of a great part of the contentment of our liues: Who could liue here, if he were not belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? Oh! what can an earthly friendship be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that in heauen: when so many thousand Angels, and Saints shall be glad of vs, and entertaine vs with vnwearied delight? If we had but the eies of faith to consider of this, we would thinke euery houre a yeare, till wee were with them?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in this world we
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16683:47"/>
want the perfection of our owne Natures: we are but maimed and deformed creatures heere; we shall neuer haue the sound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of men in vs, till we be in heauen: our holinesse of nature and gifts wil neuer be consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, till we be dead.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in this world we want liberty: <hi>Our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty</hi> will not be had here: A thing, which the Spirits of the best men haue, with much sighing, longed after: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21. 22. O who would liue in a prison, a dungeon, rather then a Palace of royall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16683:48"/>
freedome? It hath beene implyedly shewed before, that we are many waies in bondage here.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we shal euer want heere fulnesse of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>If a man liue many yeeres, so that the dayes of his yeeres bee many, if his soule be not filled with good,</hi> Salomon saith, <hi>an vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly birth is better then hee.</hi> And it is certain, if a man liue a thousand yeers twise told, hee shall neuer see sollid good to fill his hart, his appetite will neuer be filled, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 6. 3, 6, 7. There is nothing in this life can giue a man sollid, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16683:48"/>
contentment: but a man finds by experience, vanity, and vexation of spirit, in what hee admires orloues most: and shall we be so sottish as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>those riuers of pleasures that are at Gods right hand? Psal. 6. vlt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The sixt thing vvee want in this world, is our crowne, and the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and incorruptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, bought for vs with the bloud of Christ: and shall not our hearts burn within vs in longing after possession? Can we desire still to liue in wants, &amp; to be vnder age? What
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16683:49"/>
shall mooue vs, if such an incomparable crown can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not moue vs? Wee that sweat with so much sore labour for the possession of some small portion of the earth: shall wee, I say, bee so sluggish, as not to desire, that this kingdom, which our Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs, might come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon vs? or are wee so transported with spirituall madnes, as to be afraid to passe through the gate of death, to attain such a life? What Prince would liue vncrowned, if hee could helpe it, and might possess it without wrong or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16683:49"/>
and what great heire would bee grieued at the tidings, that all his Lands were falne vnto him?</p>

               <p>THus, of what he wants in this life. Secondly, he ought to bee as much troubled to think what he hath, and cannot auoide while hee liues: and thus his life is distressed, and made vnlouely, either if

               <p>For first, if hee respect God, there are two things <note place="margin">Life bitter in respect of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers waies.</note> should marre the taste of life, and make it out of liking. The first is the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of displeasing of God: who would liue to offend God? or grieue his Spirit? or any way to make him angry? Though this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will moue little in the hearts of wicked men; Yet it is of singular force in the heart of an humble Christian, who as hee accounts Gods louing kindnesse better then life:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16683:50"/>
so finds nothing more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then that he should displease God: that God (I say) who is so great in Maiesty, and hath shewed himselfe so aboundant in mercy to him. It would lye as a heauy load vpon our hearts, to think of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing of our best friend; specially if he were a great person, or a Prince. How much more should we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be rid of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, wherein we may displease our good God; and to be there, where we are sure neuer to anger him more? The second thing, that should make vs
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16683:51"/>
looke with lesse affection vpon life, is, that God doth continually crosse vs in the things of this life: The Lord doth of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose watch vs, that when hee sees vs settle any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in life, hee drops in some thing, that makes all extremely bitter: And those corrections of God should bee the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if we consider but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers aggrauations about them, as <note place="margin">Eight ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the miseries of life, in respect of the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of God.</note>

               <p n="1">1. That God will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect euery sonne, whom hee loueth, none can es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a man is vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

               <p n="3">3. That a man shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer want, what he wisheth, euen in such things, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men do not want. There is a secret vexation cleaues vnto mans estate, that their hearts run vpon such things which cannot be had, but in the Callings of other men: The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman prayseth the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens life; and the Citizen is full of the praises of the Country: And so is there in all men a liking of the Callings of other men, with a dislike of their own, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 6.</p>

                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:16683:52"/>
4. That <hi>there is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in that warre,</hi> but that a man must euery day looke for crosses. <hi>Euery day hath his griefe, Eccles. 8. 8. Luk. 9. 24. Math. 6. vlt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That God will not let vs know the times of our corrections, but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth them according to the vnchangeable purpose of his owne counsell: so as they come vpon vs, as a snare vpon a Bird. For this reason <hi>Salomon</hi> saith: <hi>That the misery of man is great vpon him, because there is a time for euery purpose, which cannot bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided, nor can man know

               <p n="6">6. That no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth either loue, or hatred, by all that is before him: A godly man can haue no such blessings outwardly, but a wicked man may haue them in as great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, as hee: nor doth there any misery fall vpon the wicked in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward crosses, but the like may befall the godly. <hi>All things come alike to all: there is one euent to the righteous and to the vvicked: to the cleane, and vncleane, to him
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16683:53"/>
that sweareth, &amp; to him that feareth an oath, as is the good, so is the sinner.</hi> This, saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> is <hi>an euill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all things, that are done vnder the Sunne, that there is one euent vnto all, Eccle.</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This bitternesse is increased, because GOD will not dispose of things according to the meanes, or likelihoods of mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. <hi>The race is not to the swift, nor the battell to the strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of vnderstanding, nor yet fauour to men of skill, but time and chance hapneth to

them all, Eccles.</hi> 9. 11.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That besides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent miseries, there are many miseries to come, so as it is an argument to proue the happines of the dead, that they are <hi>taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the miseries to come, Esay</hi> 57. 1, 2. vvhich should likewise mooue vs to loue life the lesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we know not, what fearefull alterations may come, either in our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate, or in matters of Religion.

Life is therefore apparantly vaine in respect of these things, because there are almost infinite proiects, and variety of opinions: And in all these successions of ages, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience can make men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to resolue: Which of these things haue feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in them? Who knows
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16683:62"/>
what is good for a man in this life, all the daies of his vaine life, which he spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as a shadow, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In all these things here is nothing new, but it hath beene the same, or the like to it. Now things that are common, are out of request, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. 9. 10. &amp; 3. 15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The world passeth away, and the lusts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the eare with hearing. If a man liue many daies, his soule is not filled with good; the desire after these things
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16683:62"/>
will vanish; men cannot loue them still: Our life is spent in wishing for the future, and bewailing of the past; a loathing of what wee haue tasted; and a longing for that we haue not tasted: which, were it had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would neuer more satisfie vs, then that which wee haue had. Hence it is, that men wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themselues in seeking variety of earthly things, and yet cannot bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. The vexation, that cleaues vnto them still, breeds lothing; We are like men, that are Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sick, that shift from roome

to roome, and from place to place, thinking to finde ease; neuer considering, that so long as the same Seas swell, and Windes blow, and Humors are stirred, alteration of place will not profite: So it is with vs; so long as we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with vs a nature so full of ill Humours, and that the pleasures of the world haue so much vanity in them, no change of place, or delights can satisfie vs: <hi>Seeing there are many things that encrease vanity, what is man the better?

And if in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect wee bee not of <hi>Pauls</hi> minde, it is because wee want of <hi>Pauls</hi> goodnes &amp;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16683:69"/>
grace. And this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature is the more greeuous, if wee consider either the generality of the spreading the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the incurablenes of it, or the ill effects of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the first, this is a Leprosy that spreads all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. There is no sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part in vs, our mindes, our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, our wills, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; yea, our very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="2">2. Secondly, this is the

worse, because this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable. There lyeth vpon vs a very necessity of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wee cannot but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. Of the flesh it vvas wel said, I can neither liue with thee, nor without thee. The flesh is an inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable ill companion of our liues, we can goe no whether to auoide it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if we consider but some of the effects of this corruption in vs, as</p>

The flesh is a domesticall Rebel, that daily lusts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spirit, as the Spirit hath reason to lust against the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, the insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency it breeds in vs for our callings. The greatest Apostle must in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect cryout, Who is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for these things? Though Gods worke bee all faire worke, yet we see, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burthened with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and mistakings, and insufficiencies, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him in his course of life.</p>

madnesse in the heart of a man, in some respects worse then that of some lunatickes: For they are mad at some times of the yeare, onely, or chiefly; but man is seldome, or neuer free from this inward madnesse of heart. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith, <hi>The heart of the sonnes of men is full of euil, and madnesse is in their hearts while they liue, and after that, they goe to the dead.</hi> Now this madnesse appeares in this, that men can neuer bring their harts to a settled content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the things they inioy, but Death comes

vpon them, before they know how to improue the ioy of their hearts in the blessings they enioy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temporall or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.

               <p n="2">2. And as we are thus miserable in respect of the remainders of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so are we in respect of the remainders of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sinne vpon our spirits: Our hearts were neuer fully free, since the first transgression, our minds are yet full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; that euen godly men do seriously cry out, They are but as beasts; they haue not the vnderstanding of men in them: And in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny passages of life they carry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues like beasts, <hi>Prou. 3. 3.

The ioyes of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence are for the greatest part kept from vs: our consciences are still but in a kinde of prison: when they go to the seat of iudgement to giue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in any cause, they come forth with fetters vpon their legs, as priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners themselues; besides the many personall scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges light vpon our soules in this life.</p>

                  <p>Comforts against the Paine of death.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are in the minds of all men certaine Obiections, which if they could be remoued, this feare of Death would be stocked vp by the very rootes. I will instance in some of the chiefe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and set downe the answers to them</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Ob.</hi> Some men say they should not be afraid of death, considering the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16683:74"/>
gaine of it, &amp; the happines after death, but that they are afraid of the paine of dying: It is the difficulty of the passage troubles them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> For answere heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto diuers things would be considered of, to shew men the folly of this feare.</p>
               <p>First, thou lik'st not <note place="margin">Ten rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to shew the folly of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in pre tending the feare of the pain of death.</note> death, because of the paine of it. Why, there is paine in the curing of a wound, yet men will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it. And shall death do so great a cure, as to make thee whole of all thy wounds and diseases, and art thou so loth to come
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16683:75"/>
to the cure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in getting into a Hauen. Hadst thou rather be in the Tempest stil, then put into the Hauen?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thou likest not Death, thou saiest, for the paine of it: Why then likest thou life, which puts thee to worse paine? Men obiect not at the paines of life, which they endure without death. There is almost no man, but hee hath endured worse pains in life, then he can endure in death, and yet we are content to loue life still: Yea, such is our folly, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16683:75"/>
whereas in some paines of life wee call for death to come to our succours: yet when we are well againe, wee loue life, and loath Death.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly mistaken concerning death: For the last gaspe is not death. To liue, is to die: For how much wee liue, so much we die; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry step of life is a step of death. He that hath liued halfe his daies, is dead the halfe of himselfe: Death gets first our infancie, then our youth, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: All that thou hast liued, is dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:16683:76"/>
Fifthly, it is further eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in death there is no paine; it is our life, that goeth out with paine: We deale herein, as if a man after sicknesse, should accuse his health of the last pains. What is it to be dead, but not to be in the world? and is it any paine to be out of the world? Were we in any paine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were borne? Why then accuse we death, for the paines our life giues vs at the parting? Is not sleepe a resemblance of Death?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the world bee
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16683:76"/>
with teares: Is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if our going out be so too?</p>
               <p>Seuenthly: Besides, it is euident that wee make the passage more difficult, by bringing vnto death a troubled and irresolute minde: It is long of our selues there is terrour in parting.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Consider yet more, the Humors of the most men! Men will suffer infinite paines for a small liuing, or preferment here in this world: Yea, we see souldiers for a small price will put themselues into vnspeakeable dangers, and

that many times at the pleasures of others that command them, without certaine hope of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to themselnes. Will men kill themselues for things of no valew; and yet be afraid of a litle pain to be endured, when such a glorious estate is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to be enioyed in heauen?</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Let not men pretend the paines of death, that is but a figge leafe to couer their little faith: For they will lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of the Gowte, or Stone, a long time, rather then die one sweet death
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16683:77"/>
with the easiest conditions possible.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, if none of these will perswade, yet attend, I will shew thee a Mysterie: Feare not the paines of death: For first, Death is terrible, when it is inflicted by the Law; but it is easie, when it is infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Gospell: The curse is taken off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, thou art not vnder the Law, but vnder Grace: And besides, for this cause did Christ die a terrible and a cursed death, that euery death might be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to vs. And further: God that hath greatly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16683:78"/>
thee in life, will not neglect thee in death. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the sight of the LORD, is the death of his Saints.</hi> What shall I say against the terrour of death, but this Text of the Apostle? <hi>Thankes be to God that hath giuen vs victory through Iesus Christ.</hi> Hee hath pul'd the sting out of death: <hi>O Death, where is thy sting? 1. Cor.</hi> 15. 55.</p>
               <p>Lastly, thou hast the Spirit of Christ in thee, which will succour and strengthen, and ease thee, and abide with thee all the time of the combate. Why should we doubt of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16683:78"/>
it, but that the godly die more easily then the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? Neither may wee gesse at their paine, but the pangs vpon the body: for the body may bee in grieuous panges, when the man feeles nothing, and the soule is at sweete ease in preparing it selfe to come immediately to the sight of God.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16683:79"/>
he loseth his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and it must bee rotted in the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. It hath bin shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, that the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, is properly death, but the separation of the soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, is but the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, &amp; wee haue no reason to be afraid of a shadow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The body is not the man, the man remaines still, though he be without the body. <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacab,</hi> are prooued to be liuing still by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, though their bodies were consumed in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16683:79"/>
the earth, and GOD was their God still. It is true, Death seazeth on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but a Christian, at the most, suffers, but <hi>aliquid mortis,</hi> a little of death.</p>
               <p>Death is like a Serpent; the Serpent must eat dust: now death therefore can feede vpon no more, but our dust, which is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it cannot touch the soule: wheras wicked men suffer the whole power of death, because it seazeth both vpon body and soule too, and in their case one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is true, that death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes a man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grant that wee lose
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16683:80"/>
the body in death, yet that ought not to be terrible: for what the body is, it hath been before shewed. It is but a prison to the soule, an old rotten house, or a ragged garment. It is but as the barke of a tree, or the shell, or such like; now what great losse can there be in any of these?</p>
               <p n="4">4. This separation is but for a time neither; we doe not for euer lose the body, wee shall haue our bodies again, they are kept safe for vs till the day of Christ. Our graues are Gods chests, &amp; hee makes a precious account of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16683:80"/>
bodies of his Saints, they shall bee raised vp againe at the last day: GOD will giue a charge to the earth to bring forth her dead, &amp; make a true account to him, <hi>Reue.</hi> 20. And God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs the assurance of this, not onely in his Word by promising it, but in his Sonne, whom hee hath raised from the dead. If any say, What is that to vs, that Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is raised? I answere, It is a full assurance of the safety, and of the resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bodies. For Christ is our head. Now cast a man into a Riuer,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16683:81"/>
though all the body bee vnder water, yet the man is safe, if the head bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue water. For the head will bring out all the body after it. So it is in the body of Christ, though all wee sinke in the riuer of death, yet our Head is risen, and is aboue water, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole body is safe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It should yet more satisfie vs, if we throughly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, that we shall haue our bodies againe much better then now they are. Those vile bodies wee lay down in death, shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored againe vnto vs glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16683:81"/>
bodies, like the body of Christ now glorified, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. And therefore death loseth by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our bodies; we haue a great victory ouer death. The graueis but a Furnace to refine them, they shall come out againe immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and incorruptible.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Why we should not be loth to leaue the honours of the world.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>9. <hi>Ob.</hi> IF any other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, the lothnes to leaue his honours, or high place in the world: I may answer diuers things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Why shouldest thou be so in loue with the honours of this world, if thou but consider how small thy preferment is, or can be? The whole earth <note place="margin">Fiue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations about the honors of this world.</note> is, but as the full point or center, in comparison
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16683:93"/>
with the circumference of the whole world besides. Now in true iudgement, it is almost impossible to discerne, how a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should rise higher in a Center. If thou hadst all the earth, thou wert no more exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then to the possession of a full point: a little spot in comparison, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how extremely vaine is thy nature, to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the possession of lesse, then the thousand thousand part of a little spot or point?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider seriously the thraldome, which thy preferment brings thee
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16683:94"/>
vnto: Thou canst not liue free, but still thou art fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the cares, and feares, and griefes, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thy greatnesse. There is little difference between thee and a prisoner; saue that the prisoner hath his fetters of iron, and thine are of gold; and that his fetters binde his body, and thine thy mind: He weares his fetters on his legs, and thou thine on thine head; and in this thou art one way lesse contented, then some prisoners: for they can sing for ioy of heart, when thou art deiected with the cares and griefes
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16683:94"/>
of thy minde. If thou hast a Crowne, it were but a Crowne of thornes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the cares it would put thee to, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Say thou shouldest get neuer so high, thou canst not protect thy selfe from the miseries of thy condition, nor preserue thy selfe in any certainety from the losse of all thou enioyest. If thou wert as high as the toppe of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> thou canst not get such a place, but the clouds, winds, stormes, &amp; terrible lightnings may finde thee out, so as thou wouldst account the lower
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16683:95"/>
ground to bee the safer place. Thou standest as a man on the top of a pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, thou canst not know, how soone thou maist tumble downe, and that fearefully.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If thou shouldst be sure to enioy thy greatnes of place in the world: yet thou art not sure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue thine honour: For either it may be blemished with vniust aspersions, or else some fault of thy own may marre all thy praises: For as a dead flye may mat a whole box of ointment: so may one sinne, thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 1.</p>

                  <p>Shewing the cure of this feare of death by practise.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HItherto of the way of curing this feare of death by meditation. It remaines now, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16683:98"/>
to shew how the cure is to bee finished, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <note place="margin">7. Things that cure the feare of death in practice.</note> by practise. For there are diuerse things to bee heeded by vs in our daily conuersation, which serue exceedingly for the extinguishing of this fear, without which the cure wil hardly euer be soundly wrought for continuance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first thing wee must frame our liues to for this purpose, is the contempt of the world: wee must striue earnestlie with our owne hearts, to forgoe the loue of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. It is an easie thing to be willing to dye,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:16683:99"/>
when our hearts are clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the loue of this world. We must leaue the world, before the vvorld leaue vs, and learne that lesson heartily, To vse the world, as if we vsed it not. Neither ought this to seeme too hard a precept. For they that striue for mastery, abstaine from all things, when it is but to obtaine a corruptible crowne: how much more should wee be willing to deny the delights of this world, and striue with our natures herein, seeing it is to obtaine an incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crowne? 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:16683:99"/>
We must learne of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> who brought himselfe to it willingly, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the pleasures of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and to chuse rather to suffer affliction with Gods people, then to be called the sonne of <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi> daughter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26.</p>
               <p>And to this end wee should first restraine all needlesse cares, &amp; busines of this world, and study so to be quiet, as to meddle with our own businesse, &amp; to abbridge them into as narrow a scantling, as our callings will permit. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee should auoid, as much as may bee, the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16683:100"/>
societie with the fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and minions of the world, I meane such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as admire nothing but worldly things, and know no other happinesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life: That speak onely of this world, and commend nothing, but what tends to the praise of worldly things, and so to the intising of our hearts after the world. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, wee should sort our selues with such Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as practise this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world as well as praise it, and can by their discourse, make vs more in loue with heauen.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:16683:100"/>
3. Thirdly, we should dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserue, to what things in the world our hearts most run, and striue with GOD by prayer, to get downe the too much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and desire after these things. 4. Fourthly, vvee should daily be pondring on these meditations, that shew vs the vanitie of the world, and the vilenesse of the things thereof. Thus of the first medicine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, we must in our practise, soundly mortifie our beloued sins: our sinnes must dye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we dye, or else it will not be well with vs. The
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16683:101"/>
sting of death is sinne, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue puld out the sting, we need not feare to entertaine the Serpent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our bosome. It is the loue of some sin, &amp; delight in it, that makes a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to dye, or it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of some foule euill past, which accuseth the hearts of men: and therefore men must make sure their repentance, and iudge themselues for their sinnes, and then they need not feare Gods condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them. If any aske me, how they may knowe when they haue attained to this rule, I answer, Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:16683:101"/>
they haue so long confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their sinnes in secret to God, that now they can truly say, there is no sinne they know by themselues, but they are as desirous to haue GOD giue them strength to leaue it, as they would haue God to shew them grace to forgiue it. He hath soundly repented of all sin, that desires from his heart to liue in no sin. And vnto this rule I must adde the care of an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right &amp; vnrebukeable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. It is a marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous encouragement to dye with peace, when a man can liue without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16683:102"/>
and can iustly plead his integrity of conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 3. and <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 26. 26, 27. and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, assurance is an admirable medicine to kill this feare; &amp; to speake distinctly, wee should get the assurance first of Gods fauour, and our owne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election. For hereby an entrance will be ministred into the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I handled this doctrine of the Christians assurance, before I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with this point of the feare of death. <hi>Simeon</hi> can
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16683:102"/>
dye willingly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his eyes haue seene his saluation. Feare of death is alwaies ioyned with a weake faith, and the full assurance of faith, doth maruelously e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish the heart against these feares, and breeds a certain desire of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ. <hi>Paul</hi> can be confident when he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to say, I knowe whom I haue belieued, and that hee is able to keepe that which I haue committed to him, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>Besides, we should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get a particular knowledge and assurance of our happines in death,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16683:103"/>
and of our saluation. We should study to this end, the Arguments that shews our felicity in death: And to this purpose it is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vse to receiue the Sacraments often: For Christ by his Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed Heauen to vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. and by the death of the Testator this Will is of force, and is further daily sealed vnto vs, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally by the Spirit, so externally by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Now if we get our Charter sealed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to vs, how can we be afraid of the time of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session?
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16683:103"/>
Hee is fearelesse of death, that can say with the Apostle; <hi>Whether I liue or die, I am the Lords, Rom.</hi> 14. 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That charge giuen to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> concerning the setting of his house in order, <hi>Esay</hi> 38. is of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vse for this Cure: Men should with sound aduice settle their outward estates, and dispose of their worldly affaires, and according to their meanes prouide for their wife, and children. A great part of the feare and trouble of mens hearts is ouer., when their Wils are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetely
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:16683:104"/>
made: but men are loth to die, so long as their outward estates are vnsettled, and vndisposed. It is a most preposterous course for men to leaue the making of their Wils to their sicknesse; For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their disabilities of memories or vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which may befall them, the trouble of it breeds vnrest to their minds, and besides, they liue all the time in neglect of their duty of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for death.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We may much help our selues by making vs friends with the riches of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:16683:104"/>
iniquity: we should learne that of the vniust Steward, as our Sauiour Christ sheweth, since we shall be put out of the Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, we should so dispose of them while wee haue them, that when wee die, they may receiue vs into euerlasting habitations, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. An vnprofitable life is attended with a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile feare of death.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It would master this feare, but to force our selues to a frequent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of death: To learne to die daily, will lessen, yea, remoue the feare of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Oh this remembring
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16683:105"/>
of our latter end, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to number our daies is an admirable rule of practices: It is the forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of death, that makes life sinfull, &amp; death terrible, <hi>Deut. 32. 19. Psal. 90. 12. Lam.</hi> 1. 9. And wee should beginne this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of meditation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; <hi>Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the daies of thy youth, Eccl.</hi> 12. 1. This is that is called for, when our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ requires vs, and all men, so to watch: and heerein lay the praise of the fiue wise Virgines, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 3. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> will waite, till the time of his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16683:105"/>
change come, <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 14. And of purpose hath the Lord left the last day vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, that we might eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day prepare. It were an admirable methode, if we could make euery day a life to beginne and end, as the day begins, and ends.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Lastly, because yet wee may finde this feare combersome, and our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures extremely deceitfull: there is one thing left, which can neuer faile to preuaile as far as is fit for vs; and that is hearty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God for this very thing. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> praies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 4. and <hi>Moses, Psal.</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:16683:106"/>
90. 12. and <hi>Simeon, Luk.</hi> 2. 32. And in as much as Christ died for this end, to deliuer vs from this feare, we may sue out the priuiledge, and by prayer striue with God to get it framed in vs: It is a suite God will not deny them, that aske in the name of Christ, because it is a thing that Christ especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aimed at in his owne death.</p>
               <p>To conclude then: wee haue proued, that it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be had, and most vncomely to want it; and likewise the way hath beene shewed, how both
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16683:106"/>
by meditation &amp; practise, this Cure may bee effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: If then it bee not wrought in any of vs; we may heere finde out the cause in our selues: For if wee would hereby bee soundly aduised and ruled, we might attaine to it all the daies of our life, to sing with the Saints that triumphant song, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both in the Old and New Testament: <hi>Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh hell, where is thy victory? Death is swallowed vp into victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: so as we are now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours through him that loued vs, and gaue himselfe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16683:107"/>
to death for vs:</hi> euen Iesus Christ the righteous: To whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghost bee all praise in the Churches, throughout all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for euer.</p>
