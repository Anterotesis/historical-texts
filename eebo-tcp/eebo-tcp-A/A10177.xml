         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Protestant Church, or Author,</hi> to my knowledge, that euer did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue them, either in Doctrine, or in Practise: True it is, that our owne and other Protestant Churches, haue bounded out some set times and Howers, for publike Prayers, and Deuotions, that so men might with more conuenience meete together; for Gods publike worship and seruice.

               <hi>Rhemists</hi> themselues expressely testifie: and all reformed Churches in Forraine parts, together with the fore-quoted Authors, haue vtterly reiected these Canonicall Howers: I wonder much, how our Author dares to impose, or presse them on vs now. What, did he dreame wee would all turne cloistered Monkes, and mued Nunnes; or Ancorites, and bruitish Hermites? that wee would all take Popish Orders once againe: or that wee would voluntarily chant, and mumble ouer his Deuotions euery day?

                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>To this I answer: First, that there was indeed some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> short mention made in the foresaid booke, of <hi>the first, third, sixt, and ninth howre, and of Mattens, Euening song, and Compline:</hi> But yet, that Booke was neuer intituled, the <hi>Howers of Prayer,</hi> as these <hi>Deuotions</hi> are: nether is there any one word spoken, or Scripture, or Author quoted in it to approue and iustifie the vse, and practise; or to set foorth the Antiquity of these Howers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Author pleades as much as any Papist hath, or can doe for them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, those Prayers were published in the third yeare of her famous Raigne, in the very infancy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, when as all Popish Reliques were not so fully clensed out, as afterwards they were: therefore our Author may not racke and serue them to our Aged and noone-tide seasons of the Gospell, which haue long since worne out these menstruous and polluted raggs of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Superstition, and Monkish Deuotion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was so farre from Patroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Canonicall howers, that in the second Impression of these <hi>Priuate Prayers,</hi> in the yeare 1564. printed <hi>by her Authority,</hi> these Howers were quite oblitterated, &amp; not so much as mentioned in that, or in the subsequent Edition in the yeare, 1573. which doth plainely euidence: that those <hi>Howers,</hi> were either secretly foisted into these priuate Prayers, after they were licenced for the Presse: (as I feare me much of our Authors Deuotions were,) or else, that they were ouer-slipped by the haste and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessenesse

               <p>That Booke, whose Frontispiece, Title, Frame and Method, Stile, and Phrases, yea, and Subiect matter too, is altogether Popish: must needes be meerely Popish, both in Forme, and Matter.</p>
               <p>But the Frontispiece, Title, Frame and Method, Stile, and Phrases, yea, and the Subiect matter too, of this Booke of Priuate Deuotions, is altogether Popish.</p>
               <p>Therefore this Booke of Priuate Deuotions, must needes bee meerely Popish, both in Forme, and Matter.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:21358:33"/>Which was my first, and now makes ready way, and passage to my second Conclusion.</p>
            <p>To wit; <hi>That the Authors end in publishing this Booke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of Deuotions; was nothing else; but to introduce, and vsher Popery into our Church; at least to Grace, and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This second Assertion is infalliblie euidenced, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the former. For what designe, or end can any, (especially, one who pretends himselfe a Protestant,) haue, in publishing any Treatise, whose Forme, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is meerely Popish, but onely the propagating, or at least, the countenancing, and aduancing of Popery, and Romish Superstition? Now I haue already prooued, both the Forme, and Matter of these Priuate Deuotions, to bee altogether Popish, by sundry pregnant euidences. Therefore, the Authors aime and purpose in publishing them, could bee no other, but to propagate Popery, and secretly to Vsher it by degrees into our Church; at least, to giue it some Grace, and Countenance now among vs. Besides all this; If wee consider, that these Deuotions are consarcinated, and patched vp of Popish Reliques, and Fragments, raked out of the very Dung-hill, of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Psalters, Primers, Chatechismes, and Prayer bookes: (as I haue already in part, and shall anon more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate; though the Author, and Printer doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the contrary:) how can wee but coniecture, nay, infalliblie conclude: that the Aduancement, and Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Popery, and Munkish Deuotions, was the true and vtmost end, of contriuing, collecting, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing these Deuotions?

If wee accumulate and adde to this; that these Deuotions can neuer square, nor suite with Protestants, nor any wayes promote their priuate Prayers, or Deuotions: we need not doubt, nor stager at this Conclusion: that these Deuotions were meerely published for Romes aduantage, and for the aduancement, and furtherance of Her cause, and faction: For I would willingly learne but thus much from the Author, or any of his Patriots, or Abbetters: what vse there is of these Deuotions, or Howers of Prayer, in our Church, or State?

of regulating, squaring, and reducing these to the Slauery, and Bondage, of your Canonicall Deuotions, and Howers of Prayer? Truely, there is as much hope, of making the restlesse Sunne to stay its motion, or the fixed Earth to mooue, and turne with in its Circle: so vnsuitable, and disproportionable are these new Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to all those qualities, estates, conditions, and rankes of men; of which our Church, and State consist. If then these Howers of Prayer are consonant, applicable, or aduantagious, to no members of our Church, and State, but onely to Popish <hi>Hermites, Anchorites, Friers, Munkes,</hi> and <hi>Nunnes</hi>; it is impossible for any to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture (vnlesse they will condemne, and taxe our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, of grosse and palpable folly, and improuidence:) but that the end of publishing these Deuotions in such times as ours, was meerely to aduance, and further Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and Popish Deuotions; since they can bee no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance, or helpe to any other.

            <p>I come nowe vnto my third Conclusion. <hi>That the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Author endeauours to make Queene Elizabeth, of euer bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed memory, the Patronesse of this his Poperie, and to harbour it vnder her Protection.</hi> This is most cleare and euident: First, from the Title: Secondly, from the Preface of the Booke. For the first of these; our Author entitles this Booke of his, <hi>A collection of Priuate Deuotions: in the Practise of the Ancient Church, called the Howers of Prayer: as they were after this manner, published by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21358:37"/>
of Queene Elizabeth</hi> 1560. (saith the first and second; but: <hi>as they were much after this manner published by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Queene Elizabeth,</hi> 1560. saith the third Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:) <hi>taken out of holy Scriptures, the Ancient Fathers, and the Diuine Seruice of our owne Church:</hi> In which hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes these two things. First, that these <hi>priuate Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Howers of Prayer,</hi> are no new Deuotions of his owne composing, but onely a reuiuall or new Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those priuate Prayers and Deuotions, as were formerly published by Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the yeare 1560. and so did most men take them to bee at first, till they had better sifted and examined them. Secondly, that the mater of these Deuotions were published by the approbation of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or at leastwise war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by her Authority: therefore there can bee no Popery or poysonous Doctrines couched in them, and all that loue the name and memory of that blessed Queene, should buy and approue them. A glorious and bewitching Title or Prologue I confesse, but yet a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and insnaring Booke. Of which I may truely say, <note n="*" place="margin">

(to omit his <hi>Laudes</hi> taken out of our Ladies Primer,) is for the most part transcribed out of <hi>Kellams Manuall,</hi> presantly after his Kalender: where he describes, the vse, and reason of these Ember weekes: the Paralelling of which; together with his Prayer for the Dead, (which I haue already touched vpon;) I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely omit, for feare of being two prolixe; since I haue here, as I suppose, su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, that our Author borrowed both the forme, and matter of these Deuotions from Popish Authors, as the present Paralel doth abundantly testifie; are chiefely two: First, because the Author hath for sundry yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Monopolized, and bought vp for his owne priuate

vse, (as I am crediblely informed,) all sorts of Popish Primers, Prayer Bookes, Chatechismes, Breuiaries, and Pamphlets whatsoeuer, (of which he hath great store:) and yet hee is alwayes inquisitiue after more. Secondly, because hee hath caused sundry of his Popish Prayer Bookes, Primers, and breuiaries, to bee bound vp in a very curious, and costly manner, with guilded leaues, and Couers, stamped sometimes with a Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But passing by the fourth, I come now vnto my fift Conclusion: That there are diuers Popish falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, absurdities, and abuses of Scripture in these new Deuotions: Not to trouble you with many, I will onely single out some three or foure: As first, <hi>His seuen deadly sinnes:</hi> to wit, <hi>Pride, Couetousnesse, Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, Enuie, Gluttonie, Anger, Sloth:</hi> for which hee quotes, as the Papists out of which hee did transcribe them doe: <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. <hi>in the margent.</hi> Now if you looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. the Text which hee quotes; you shall finde not <hi>seuen,</hi> but <hi>seuenteene deadly sinnes,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expressed: to wit; <hi>Adultery, Fornication, Vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Lasciuiousnesse, Idolatrie, Witchcraft, Hatred, Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Sedition, Heresies, Enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Murthers, Drunkennesse, Reuilings, and such like,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides: so that our Author hath committed a treble absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and abuse of Scripture in this one particular: First, in mentioning onely seuen deadly sinnes, when as the Text doeth speake of seuenteene, whereby he pares, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> clips the Scripture: Secondly, in producing this Text, to warrant these seuen deadly sinnes; when as sixe of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21358:47"/>
the seuen, to wit, <hi>Pride, Couetousnesse, Luxurie, Gluttonie, Anger, and Sloth,</hi> are not so much as mentioned here: whereby hee sophisticates, and peruerts the Scripture: Thirdly, in mustering vp these inferiour sinnes, as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> most capitall, and greatest sinnes of all others; not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, <hi>Idolatrie, Heresie, Adultery, Witchcraft, Vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Sedition, and Drunkennesse</hi>; to which I might adde, Atheisine, Infidelitie, Contempt of the Gospel, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Sacriledge, the Profanation of the Sacraments, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

how is the man aliue? if the man be dead, as well as the body, as hee must be, or else the body is not dead: how is this then no Prayer for the dead?

of these his Popish Deuotions in this Age of ours, when as few Orthodox, or pious Authors can finde such grace and fauour at his or others hands. For my owne part, I haue heard of diuers who haue tendred Bookes of late to Licence, to which there could bee no exceptions ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and yet they had repulse without any cause assigned. Some of them haue beene reiected for the Authors name alone: and others for their pious matter, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Doctor of this Citie was, not long ago, put from Preaching at <hi>Pauls</hi> Crosse, by reason of his <note n="a" place="margin">To wit, <hi>Isai.</hi> 42, 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>Seasonable and right pious Text</hi>; Not to speake of others: I my selfe can testifie: that I haue tendred sundry Treatises of mine owne to Licence: (as one against <hi>Health-drinking,</hi> and this <hi>very Suruay and Censure of</hi> Mr. Cozens <hi>his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions</hi> among others:) to which there was no iust ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions taken, but that they were mine; or that they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the errors, sins, and common euills of the Times, (which it seemes are like to passe without controule,) and for this they were reiected: yea I had one Treatise of late denyed Licence, which else had passed readily to the Presse, but that they knew at last it was my hand: and that alone was cause enough to purchase a <hi>Non-licet:</hi> though God knowes I neuer yet, (neither shall I hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by my good will) published any thing, but what all Othodoxe Diuines and godly Christians haue approued, as Orthodox, seasonable, and necessarie for the present times. I wonder therefore since so few Bookes (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good Bookes in defence of truth, and opposition of sin) can haue the happines to finde any publik approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Presse; that these <hi>Popish Deuotions,</hi> together with some other Treatises and Sermons now in question, could be so fortunate, as to procure not onely Licence, but presixed Approbations.

the more dangerous downefall to our Religion? and that these his Popish Deuotions might stand as an vnanswerable, authorized and approued record against vs vnto all Posteritie? Certainly the Authors impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in seeking, and his treachery in purchasing this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and notorious Approbation for his Booke, that so it might doe the greater hurt, and giue a more fatall and pernicious blow and brand to our Religion, is so far from extenuating, that it doth infinitely aggrauate and increase his guilt. Authoritie added vnto euill things detracts not from their euill, but intends it more: this Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation therefore will not salue, but fester and inlarge his sore. But were these Popish Deuotions Licenced in good earnest? Why then was not the Approbation annexed to the written Copy as it ought to bee, but to a meere loose Paper, which was neuer ioyned with the Copy? Why doth the Printer report abroad, that the <hi>Bishop of London</hi> neuer read the Booke; and that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him nothing but a bare white Paper, with a Message from the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> that now is, to Licence these <hi>Deuotions:</hi> to which he set his hand, and wrote his Approbation, when as he neuer had perused, nor seene the Booke it selfe? Either the Printer therefore is a lying Knaue, (as most report him to be:) or else the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London</hi> neuer read, and so neuer could approue this Booke: But admit the Printer (whose dishonestie is reported to be such, that he will Print any thing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer for his priuat gaine,) hath mis-reported the cariage of this Licence, and that the BB. of <hi>London</hi> read the Book (as is most probable, because his Aprobation shews as much:) yet I would willingly learne thus much, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Printed Coppy differs not from the written one, which was allowed by his Lordship? or whether there is not some Popery inserted in the Printed, which was either wholly razed out, or else omitted in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Coppy? For mine owne part, I cannot but suspect, that most of the Popery, that is broached and couched
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21358:62"/>
in this booke was foysted in at the Presse, without my Lord of Londons priuitie: and the more iealous am I of this, because the Printer had his written Coppy but by peecemeale, sheete by sheete, and not compleate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; because the written Copy was taken from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as he Printed it, by the Author, against the vsuall course: and because there were sundry leaues reprinted and altered at the Presse by the Authors bare direction: (who hath likewise lately made some alterations in our Common Prayer Booke, by what Authoritie I knowe not:) So that it is most probable, that our Author hath exceeded, and abused, not followed his Authoritie, which makes his crime the greater. So that this first excuse and Plea, doth onely aggrauate, not lessen or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate his faulte.</p>

Thirdly, I answere: that this is but a meere forged and false pretence, as most euidently appeares: First, by the multitude of the bookes that were printed off, yea sold, at first: being 250 at the least, as the Printer hath confessed: since which, there hath beene a second Impression of 1000. Bookes more, little different from the first: Now would any one be so mad, as to print off 1250 Bookes at least, to bequeath as a Legacie or New-yeares-gift to one priuate friend or two, when as twelue or 20 Bookes would serue for such a purpose? the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude therefore, and second Impression of these Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe sufficiently euidence: that the Authors end in printing was, to publish them vnto the world; and by them to scatter his seedes of Popery farre and neere: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, our Authors tendring his booke to licence to the Ordinary, and his procuring of his annexed approbation, is a pregnant testimony, that his first intent was to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge it, else there were no neede of any such approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Thirdly, the Ordinaries approbation which runs thus: <hi>I haue read ouer this Booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which for the encrease of priuate Deuotions, I thinke may well bee printed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe giue lycence for the same.

Thirdly, in the last Impression, there are onely two Popish Assertions rectified; to wit, <hi>the Mediation of Angels,</hi> not altered in the second; and <hi>the Prayer for the Dead,</hi> refined onely in the second, but quite expunged out of the last Impression: which though it bee cleared of these two: yet it is still furnished with those 18. other points of Popery which I haue former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deduced from it: and that Popish trash, and Romish absurdities, which I haue discouered in my precedent Conclusions. Yea, the very forme and method of it, which is wholy Popish, is still the same: wherefore there needs a further purging of these vncleane <hi>Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> I meane by fire, which onely can defecate, and cleanse them from their Romish drosse. Fourthly, though
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21358:65"/>
there are some points of Popery oblitterated, not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, but vpon great complaints at Counsell Table: yet there is no point at all recanted in any of the subsequent Editions, to giue any publike satisfaction to the World: yea, there is neither of the Editions suppressed, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited sale as they ought to be: but all of them being of one date, of one yeere, euen 1627. hauing the selfe-same allowance, and approbation prefixed them, are sold, (and for ought I know Printed,) promiscuously without any let, or contradiction: so that our Author stands but where he did at first, since all his editions stand approoued, and passe for currant Coyne.
