         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS there is nothing that has been hitherto writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, tho' never ſo perfect, (not even the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures themſelves excepted) nor yet
in any Age of the World or Period of Time, but hath
been liable to the Cavils of ſome, and Scorn of others; <hi>no
Man</hi> can ſuppoſe me ſo far bigotted to my own Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and much leſs <hi>my ſelf,</hi> as once to think of a
Poſſibility of eſcaping the common Calamity of Authors
in this Kind; Eſpecially when I conſider, that the very
Nature of the Vndertaking is ſuch, as not to exempt it
from the Cenſures of the meaneſt Capacity, who will take
upon him to judge of the Tranſactions of his own Time in
as Deſpotick a Manner, as if himſelf had been actually
concerned in them, and privy to the moſt Secret as well
as minuteſt Paſſages thereof. How much more unlike
then is it, that I ſhould pretend to ſurmount the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of thoſe, who would be thought to be more <hi>criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
vers'd</hi> in Hiſtorical Tracts; And who will ſay,
the Revolutions of the ſucceeding Age will be little enough
to make a Compleat Diſcovery of the Truths of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
One; And that Time alone can give every Thing
its true Light, which the Authority of Superiors, and
prevalent Partiality of Writers, muſt at preſent involve
in too great an Obſcurity to be truſted to; And that tho'
the daring Preſumption of a few may have been thought
to reach ſo far as to make a Reparation of this Deficiency,
yet that has been obſerved to have been uſually no other
than a <hi>glaring Light,</hi> and ſuch as has been borrowed,
either from a prejudiced Fancy, or intereſted Self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62930:3"/>
But how plauſible ſoever theſe Objections may be, I
muſt aſſume the Liberty to ſay, That beſides the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſome of the moſt <hi>Celebrated Hiſtorians</hi> that have
ever writ to juſtifie my preſent Practiſe, I cannot ſee any
ſuch Inconveniency to ariſe, (as would be ſuggeſted) from
writing the Hiſtory of the Age to the Age it ſelf: For
tho' it ſhould be allowed, that ſome Things ſhould neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
lie dormant as to us, and be reſerved to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of future Generations, yet ſurely there are many
others that muſt be unavoidably loſt, if protracted to
ſuch an uncertain Period, where not only a true Idea of
Things, and many Notions relating to the Humour of
our Age upon emergent Turns and Occaſions, will be quite
extinct: But many Accidents and Circumſtances (as
a late learned Author has noted) which are no part of the
Records of Time, and which ſoon die and are forgotten,
are ſo interwoven in Hiſtory, as to make it entire, and
of one piece, aud which not only enlivens it, and creates
Pleaſure in the reading of it, but without them Hiſtory
it ſelf becomes disjonted, and is made up of broken Pieces.</p>
            <p>But though what has been now offered might be allowed for a Satisfactory Anſwer in relation to a full Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for future Diſcoveries, there are yet a ſort of
Gentlemen of a nicer Palate, who rather than the Work
ſhould paſs untraduced, will quarrel at the Method of
it, and utterly diſclaim any thing that appears by the
way of <hi>Annals,</hi> as being neceſſarily broken Matter, and
and ill-concerted together, that creates no manner of
Pleaſure in the reading of it; but on the contrary, makes
the Matter it ſelf to be nauſeated, becauſe of the Manner
of it.</p>
            <p>Now, I confeſs, it will be a hard Task to give a plenary Satisfaction herein, eſpecially where there is not only ſo much Colour of Reaſon, but ſome real Truth in what is
ſuggeſted thereby. But certainly, if Things were duely
weighed in all their Circumſtances, there would be, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
much leſs Error found in the Method it ſelf, than
the Management of it: For the Want of a good Connection
<pb facs="tcp:62930:3"/>
and ſuitable Diſpoſition of Things, will make that look
monſtrous and diſtorted, that otherwiſe might prove
beautiful and charming enough. And as I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
with a ſtudied Sedulity, to avoid this great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency,
ſo if the Succeſs ſhould prove anſwerable
thereto, it will firſt remove the Objection, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſatisfie the Readers Scruples and Curioſity. But
on the other hand, were it taken for granted, that all
Annals, after all, cannot be ſo well concerted, as other
Methods of Writing are, where the Liberty of Joining,
Dividing, Contracting, and Enlarging, is nothing near
ſo ſtinted as in the preſent Caſe: Yet it muſt not be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but an exact <hi>beating of Time,</hi> which is ſo peculiar
and eſſential a Part of our Method, and with which no
other can pretend to vie to this Particular, does undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
over-compenſate the other Deficiencies it may be
liable to. And to ſay, It has been both an ancient and
modern Practice, ſhould not (in my poor Opinion) leſſen,
but rather encreaſe an Eſteem of it.</p>
            <p>It remains now we ſhould give a ſuccinct Account of the Treatiſe it ſelf; and ſo much the rather, becauſe tho' all the preceding Suggeſtions to the Prejudice of it
were totally removed, yet I cannot but foreſee, that
there is Space enough left ſtill for Cavilling and finding
Faults, which every Man would obviate according to
the juſt Rules that are allowed him, as well as in the beſt
Manner he could.</p>
            <p>I hope it will not be expected I ſhould make a Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration, in this place, of every particular Author I have made uſe of towards the Compiling of this Book:
This (I am ſure) would be to ſwell a Preface beyond all
juſt, and even tolerable Bounds, and render the ſame
as contemptible, as ſome of thoſe Authors I have made
an Inſpection to; becauſe I would ſee every Thing that
could be thought to make for my Purpoſe, tho' no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
uſed by me than to diſcover Falſhood from Solid
Truth: And yet to be altogether ſilent upon this Head
would appear too Dictator-like; as if <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:62930:4"/>
no farther, were enough to ſtop all Mens Mouths, and
make them acquieſce with it. Our Hiſtory then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences
from the Time of the firſt ſetting on foot the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> whereof Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> has given ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
an Account, as to the Riſe, Progeſs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of it, as has proved to the Satisfaction, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
of all Men, (the <hi>French</hi> excepted) who have wrote
a Treatiſe alſo upon the ſame Subject, Dedicated to
Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> one of the Active Plenipotentiaries
of <hi>France</hi> on that Occaſion; And which, tho' it carries
all thoſe Affectations which are ſo peculiar to that Nation
throughout the whole Body of it; yet, I muſt own, it
has given Light to ſome other Things, that otherwiſe
might have remained in the Dark to this Day: From
theſe two I have made up, (ſaving what refers to ſome
particular Articles and intervening Paſſages relating to
the War, wherein They are generally very conciſe) that
Treaty entire; which brought me of Courſe into an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the Popiſh Conſpiracy, and what ſucceeded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
at Home, more particularly in relation to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
as well as Demeanour of our then Court, where
I have not had Leiſure to dwell over-long, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traventions,
and, I may ſay, Infractions of the ſaid Treaty,
called me Abroad, from whence I have paſſed into <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
and after having given an Account of ſomething
preludious to the War there, which will, I belive, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
ſtill a Paradox, I have, in the reſpective Years
of it, traced the ſame, as well as thoſe managed by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Venice,</hi> the Emperor's Confederates therein,
againſt the Infidels, throughout the whole Variety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to the final Period of it. And herein, I confeſs my
ſelf to have received great Aſſiſtances from divers Tracts
written concerning particular Sieges, and other memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Actions, as they occurred. And as I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to oblige the Reader with as many Original Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
as I could in relation to this War, ſo it will be found
I have not declined the ſame Practiſe in reſpect to other
Occurrences; and, more eſpecially, have been very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
<pb facs="tcp:62930:4"/>
to omit nothing of that kind that was worthy to
be perpetuated in Reference to our own Affairs; to that
grand Revolution that happened amongſt us; the ſecret
Machinations uſed to unhinge our Settlements; and the
tedious and bloody War we have been ſince engaged in,
which I have made my Buſineſs to give as true a Light
into, as was conſiſtent with the various and diverſified
Relations, that by the contending Parties have been given
of it: And if I ſhould intimate in this Place, that I have
made it part of my Buſineſs to keep a Journal of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of theſe Times; and add thereto, That I have
had the Aſſiſtance of the beſt Authors in moſt Languages;
and that, in conſequence hereof, not few Things have been
rectified or ſupplied from my own particular Obſervations
and Diſcoveries, I ſhould do my ſelf no Wrong, though
I might incur the Cenſures of others for it. But, after
all, I am ſo far from pretending to have committed no
Error herein, that all I will ſay, is, I am not guilty of any
wilful Miſtake. But as this Treatiſe would have been
very lame and imperfect, if, amidſt the Sound of War,
I had not obſerved the Overtures made from time to time
of a Peace; So I ſhould have been much more inexcuſable,
if I ſhould not have been very particular concerning the
laſt general Negotiation, in all the Paces made till the
final Concluſion of it; and of which, I am morally aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
there is a much better Account given, than is yet
to be found any other where, now extant amongſt us.</p>
            <p>But, as it will be needleſs to inſiſt upon the Vſefulneſs of the Introductory Diſcourſe I have given, to ſhow the State of the World, in reſpect to the Enlargement of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and Conqueſt, down to the Commencement of our
Hiſtory; to ſay any thing for the Neceſſity of a Table to
the whole Work, will be much more ſo: Wherefore, to
conclude, As our Hiſtory ends with the General Peace we
now enjoy, let our Value and Eſteem of him, who, under
God, has been the particular Inſtrument of it, our dread
Sovereign King <hi>William,</hi> be enhaunſed more and more,
who has ſo many Perſonal Excellencies, both in Peace and
<pb facs="tcp:62930:5"/>
War, as to have no manner of Need to borrow any from
the Vertues of his Anceſtors, whereof there has been ſuch
an unparallell'd Chain, as is not to be met with in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory;
And the Antiquity of whoſe Name, for ought
I can ſee, may be as old as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who in the
First Book of his <hi>Commentaries,</hi> ſays, <hi>A Body of</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<hi>out of</hi> Suabia, <hi>came, under the Command of

Now this is ſo much the more worthy of Obſervation, that
beſides the Similitude of the Names of <hi>Naſua</hi> and <hi>Naſau,</hi>
which only differ in the Tranſpoſition but of one Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
there is an Eſtate upon that Spot of Ground, which
belongs to the Family to this Day: But be it as it will, I
was the more deſirous to take Notice of it upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
becauſe I believe it is the firſt time it has been done
by any other in this kind: And becauſe it may ſtir up the
Curioſity of thoſe Gentlemen that are skilled in Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THERE has been almoſt as much Conteſt between the Learned, about what Form of Government is beſt, and was of Primitive Inſtitution, as there has been Endeavours uſed by the Princes
and States of the World, to propagate their Dominion and Power, to
the Diminution of that of their Neighbours. This Itch of Superiority
and Rule has in all Ages, from the Beginning, been the Property of all
ſorts of Governments. And though it has been a general Aſſertion, and
and pretty common Obſervation of Latter Times, that Republicks, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ariſtocratical, Democratical,</hi> or otherwiſe conſtituted, have not been
ſo proper for Extending of Conqueſt, as <hi>Monarchical</hi> Conſtitutions; yet,
that it has not been always ſo, is manifeſt from the Commonwealths of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> who enlarged the Bounds of their Dominions to a
greater Degree than any other Kingdom or State whatever, that we know
of, ſave ſomewhat more that was done by the Introduction of a ſingle Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
into the former Republick; which yet did not prove of any long
Duration, or fixed Settlement: For, tho' no Empire upon Earth could ever
pretend to vye with that of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Particular, and which therefore,
for that Reaſon, we may call <hi>An. Vniverſal Monarchy;</hi> yet, being at length
tired out, and craſie with Age, ſhe ſunk under her own Weight, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run,
and divided into divers Pieces, by thoſe Nations ſhe ever termed <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous;</hi>
but proved neither ſo contemptible in their Arms, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o unskilful
in Government, as the Name they gave them did import.</p>
            <p>'Tis, indeed, not to be doubted, but that the Diviſion made of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, by <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> between his Two Sons, <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> into the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern,</hi> did very much precipitate the Ruine of it: For, tho'
the former, for many Ages after, made a Shift to keep up, yet it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
ſhort of the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, for Power and Splendour; and
was ſo haraſſed, by degrees, with the Inſults of the Neighbouring Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and diminiſhed by the Conqueſts of the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> over one part of it;
by the <hi>Saracens</hi> ſubduing <hi>Paleſtine, Syria, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Cilicia;</hi> by the City of
<hi>Trebeſond,</hi> and the Neighbouring Countries, withdrawing themſelves from
under the Obedience of it, and chuſing an Emperor of their own; as <hi>Greece</hi>
ſet up divers petty Princes, to govern the different Parts of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; That the
poor Remains thereof was not only ſwallowed up at length by the <hi>Turks,</hi>
but moſt of the ſaid conquer'd or revolted Diviſions, to other very great
Acquiſitions of their own, made both before and after, fell under their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
alſo; which made them, for a Time, more formidable in Power, than
any other ſingle Dominion, known to us, in thoſe Parts of the World. But the
Fate of the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Part of that divided Empire came on a pace, the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a Prey to the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Goths,</hi> who, about this time, came in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Numbers, to change their poor Habitations, for the pleaſant and
fertile Provinces of the <hi>Romans: Britain</hi> became a Prey to the <hi>Saxons: Spain</hi>
fell to the Share of the <hi>Weſt-Goths:</hi> The <hi>Goths, Burgundians</hi> and <hi>Franks</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62930:6"/>
made bold with dividing <hi>France</hi> between them: <hi>Rhoetia</hi> and <hi>Noricum</hi> were
conquered by the <hi>Suevians:</hi> A great part of <hi>Pannonia</hi> and <hi>Illiricum</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Hands of the <hi>Huns:</hi> The <hi>Vandals</hi> fixed their Habitations in <hi>Africa:</hi>
And one part of the <hi>Goths</hi> ſet up a Kingdom in <hi>Italy,</hi> and did not think
<hi>Rome,</hi> once Miſtreſs of the World, and the common Mother and Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mankind, a fitting Place for their Kings to reſide in.</p>
            <p>The Empire being thus mangled, and rent into ſo many different Pieces, the next Thing (according to the Courſe of a corrupted and vain World)
theſe Invaders went upon, (after ſome tolerable Settlement in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Acquiſitions;) was, to incroach upon their Neighbours, and to
endeavour to introduce ſuch a Dominion again upon the Earth, as might
(in Imitation of that glorious Empire, which all of them, in their ſeveral
Turns, had given an Helping-hand to overthrow) over-top all others, and
merit the Name of a Supream and Univerſal One: But there have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
in the Courſe of Divine Providence, ſuch Rubs been laid in the
Way of this Deſign, that it could never be accompliſh'd, tho' divers
Princes have attempted it with the greateſt Application, and ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Probability of Succeſs.</p>
            <p>As Iſlands are not ſo liable to be invaded, as thoſe Kingdoms and States that lie upon the Continent; So neither are they, on the other hand, ſo proper to make Conqueſts of others, and to enlarge their Territories. And
if <hi>Great Britain</hi> has come, in any reſpect, ſhort of other Countries in this
Particular, this is a ſufficient Reaſon for it. But there were other Cauſes and
Conſiderations, which we ſhall a little conſider, before we go any farther.</p>
            <p>Tho' tho <hi>Saxons</hi> made an entire Conqueſt of the beſt and fruitfulleſt Part of <hi>Britain;</hi> yet neither the moſt Northern Parts of the Iſland, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> nor the Southern, known ſince by the Name
of <hi>Cornwall;</hi> much leſs the ancient Habitation of the <hi>Britains,</hi> wrongfully
called <hi>Wales,</hi> could they ſubdue in a long time, nor the firſt, indeed, at
all entirely. Add to this, That the <hi>Saxons</hi> themſelves had no leſs than
Seven Dynaſties, or petty Kingdoms, amongſt them, known all together
by the <hi>Heptarchy;</hi> which took them up, from their firſt Landing under
<hi>Hengiſt,</hi> by Alliances, and the Power of their Arms, not much leſs than
400 Years, to unite them into one Monarchy, which happen'd under K.
<hi>Egbert,</hi> about the Year 800. But tho' this Conjunction of Seven into One
was very conſiderable, and that now ſome grand Efforts might have been
made for reducing the remaining Parts of the Iſland under one Head;
the <hi>Danes,</hi> now a very Potent and Sea-faring People, in the very ſame
King's Reign, invaded <hi>Britain;</hi> Between whom, and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> there were
continual Wars, for the Space of 240 Years; and the former ſo far prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Three of their Kings reigned ſucceſſively over <hi>England,</hi> for 26
Years, when the Government returned again into the Hands of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh:</hi>
But it was ſo weak and feeble, that in a ſhort time it fell into the Hands
of <hi>Will.</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and his <hi>Normans;</hi> in whoſe Son's Reign,
(<hi>Henry</hi> I. by Name,) the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy</hi> was annexed to the
Crown of <hi>England.</hi> This ſo conſiderable Acceſſion of Strength upon the
Continent came yet ſhort of a Compenſation for the ſtill remaining Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> from the reſt of <hi>Britain,</hi> which the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:62930:6"/>
Kings little minded to effect: For, tho' <hi>Henry</hi> II. was the greateſt
King at this time in our <hi>Weſtern</hi> World, as being, beſides K. of <hi>England</hi> and
Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> by Inheritance Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and by Marriage Duke
of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Poictou;</hi> yet he was ſo far from going through ſtitch with
his intended Conqueſt of <hi>Wales,</hi> or reducing <hi>Scotland,</hi> that his chief Aim
was upon the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which, tho' a noble Deſign, and in a
very great Meaſure effected, yet it was miſplaced, and ſhould have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Reduction of the other two. Yet what came to <hi>Henry</hi> upon
the Continent, by Right of Inheritance, his Son King <hi>John,</hi> and his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<hi>Henry</hi> III. in a manner, totally loſt. But of all the Kings of <hi>England,</hi>
to this Time, <hi>Edward</hi> I. was the only Prince that ſeemed to have a right
Notion of Extending his Dominions; and therefore he never gave over,
till what by fair and foul Means, with an Intermixture of Policy, he entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
united <hi>Wales</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> and made, in a manner by
the ſame Methods, a perfect Conqueſt of <hi>Scotland;</hi> which nothing (hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
ſpeaking) but the Weakneſs of his Succeſſor, obſtructed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation
of. So that henceforward all the Thoughts of our Warlike
Kings, were, the Recovery of that Right they alledged to have to the
Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> whoſe Conqueſts there, if they had been as wiſely
ſecured, as they were valiantly made, had added a much greater Glory to
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name, than our Annals would otherwiſe admit of. But that
which our Kings would not, or could not, add to their Dominions by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
within the Iſland it ſelf, I mean the <hi>Scotch</hi> Kingdom, which always
obſtructed the Progreſs of their Arms upon the Continent, at length fell
in of it ſelf in the Courſe of Succeſſion: So that <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were, in the Perſon of King <hi>James</hi> I. united under one Head. In the
mean time one of our Neighbour-Nations was arrived to that Pitch of
Greatneſs, and another of them in ſo growing a Poſture, that ſuch a Tripple
Conjunction ſeemed only ſeaſonable upon this Account, in that the ſame
tended to our Safety.</p>
            <p>But by what Methods theſe our Neighbouring-Nations have attained to that Greatneſs, it will be neceſſary to enquire into: And, firſt, we ſhall begin with <hi>Spain,</hi> which, upon the Declenſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, fell
into the Share of the <hi>Weſt-Goths,</hi> and other barbarous Nations, who for
a Time laboured under the ſame Inconveniencies of a divided Dominion,
as the <hi>Saxons</hi> did in <hi>Britain:</hi> But towards the Year 586, their Empire was
arrived to the higheſt Pitch of Greatneſs, as comprehending not only the
Neighbouring-Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> and part of <hi>Mauritania</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> but
alſo all <hi>Spain,</hi> except a ſmall Part, poſſeſſed yet by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who held
not that long neither. From thence the <hi>Gothick</hi> Empire declined apace,
and all fell into the Hands of the <hi>Saracens.</hi> But their Affairs began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
again about the Year 726; and one <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who was ſaid to have
been deſcended from the Race of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Kings, prevailed mightily
both againſt the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> as divers of his Succeſſors did alſo.
However, theſe turmoiled Times gave Original to ſeveral Kingdoms
within the Boundaries of <hi>Spain;</hi> For beſides the Kingdom of <hi>Oviedo,</hi> or
<hi>Leon,</hi> which were all one in Effect, there aroſe alſo others; as thoſe of
<hi>Navarre, Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile.</hi> But all theſe Kingdoms, which alſo profeſſed
<pb facs="tcp:62930:7"/>
Chriſtianity, were united in the Perſon of <hi>Sanctus Major</hi> II. whereby an
Opportunity was given the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to root out the <hi>Moors,</hi> now divided
amongſt themſelves, and to reſtore <hi>Spain</hi> to its ancient State: yet <hi>Sanctus,</hi>
tho' otherwiſe a brave Prince, had no more Wit than to divide them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his Sons, and gave each of them the Title of King. Theſe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to confine themſelves to their reſpective Proportions, made War
upon one another, with various Succeſs; as it gave the <hi>Moors</hi> alſo ſome
Advantage in their Proceedings, till, in a manner, all was united again,
under <hi>Alphonſo</hi> VIII. who play'd the ſame Trick, of dividing <hi>Caſtile, Leon</hi>
and <hi>Gallicia</hi> between his 3 Sons; ſo that they and their Succeſſors had ſo
much to do with the <hi>Moors</hi> within <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſuch mutual Jealouſies of one
another, that they could be able to do little any where elſe under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Conqueſt. Things were at length brought to ſuch a paſs, that <hi>Spain</hi>
(to ſay nothing of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the Kingdom of the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Granada</hi>)
was reduced into Two Kingdoms only, to wit, <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and
theſe again were united by the Marriage of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Son of <hi>John</hi> II.
King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> whom his Father had declared King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> to <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
Siſter to <hi>Henry</hi> IV. King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> By this Conjunction <hi>Spain</hi> became
mighty Powerful; And <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> after he had ſet his Affairs in Order,
began now to entertain great Thoughts: And well knowing it would be in
vain to undertake any Thing Abroad, while he had a powerful Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Body of <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf at his Door; he undertook an Expedition againſt
the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> which coſt him ſo much Time and Expence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
being no leſs than 10 Years engaged in the Work, that he could, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
have ſat down contented herewith, at leaſt for a time, had not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe fallen in his way. But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> by aiming to make ſure of his
Conqueſt, deprived his Country in ſome ſucceeding time of the Benefit
of it; for he thereupon baniſhed no leſs than 170000 Families of <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Moors</hi> out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and thereby diſpoiled his Country, not only of vaſt
Riches, but a great Number of Inhabitants, wherein conſiſts the Power
and Support of a Nation.</p>
            <p>But whatever Deſigns <hi>Ferdinand</hi> might, after a little breathing Time, have concerted to have undertaken Abroad, now he was freed from the Evil that had hitherto diverted him from any Foreign Expedition, the
<hi>French</hi> who now found themſelves under the ſame Circumſtances, as being
rid of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that had ſtuck ſo long and ſo cloſe upon the Skirts of
them, as not to be able to move elſewhere, thought to be before-hand with
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> in the Reduction of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> which the other,
notwithſtanding they gave him up <hi>Rouſillion</hi> in order at leaſt to let them
proceed unmoleſted, being not able to brook, it came to an open Rupture;
And after divers Conflicts, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> carried the Day, and with it the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Naples,</hi> to which, if we add the Diſcovery of <hi>America,</hi> and the rich
Mines there about this time, and the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre</hi> which <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
poſſeſt himſelf of upon the Pope's Excommunicating <hi>John d' Albret,</hi> King
of that Country, at the other's Inſtigation; we ſhall find this Monarchy
grown to a prodigious Grandeur. In this State, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> left it to his
Grandſon <hi>Charles,</hi> who being as well elected Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> as he
was Hereditary King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and withal a very active Prince; Tho' he
<pb facs="tcp:62930:7"/>
did very great Things, whilſt he held the Rains of Government; yet it
may ſtill ſeem a Wonder he had not done much more. This was, indeed, an
Age fruitful for ſeveral brave Princes, and here I cannot but admire the
Wiſdom of God, that this <hi>Charles</hi> V. who was ſo vaſtly Potent, ſhould have
for his Cotemporaries a <hi>Harry</hi> VIII. in <hi>England,</hi> a <hi>Francis</hi> I. in <hi>France,</hi> and
a <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent in <hi>Turky,</hi> who were all Men of great Souls, as
well as Power, and eſpecially the laſt of them, not inferior to <hi>Charles</hi> upon
any account. However, ſuch was the Conjuncture, that <hi>Charles</hi> to his vaſt
Dominions added ſtill more, by routing <hi>Francis</hi> and taking him Priſoner,
and thereby bringing him to make a Surrender of the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
to renounce the Sovereignty over <hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to quit all his
Pretences upon <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> which laſt the <hi>French</hi> had for ſome time
been in Poſſeſſion of: But <hi>Francis</hi> having got his Liberty, diſclaimed the
Agreement, and this occaſioned a new War, which ended in <hi>Francis</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced to confirm the Main of the ſaid Treaty, and left <hi>Charles</hi> at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to add to the Conqueſts his Grand-father <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had made in <hi>Africa,</hi>
of <hi>Bugia</hi> and <hi>Tripolis,</hi> that of <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Goletta,</hi> to which if we add the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
of <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> of the Provinces of <hi>Over Iſſel, Geldren, Zutphen, Gronin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen,</hi>
&amp;c. conſigned about this Time into his Hands, it muſt ſtill be allowed
a mighty Acceſſion of Strength to that vaſt Empire. Wherefore, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
as he thought, his great Work of attaining to an Univerſal Monarchy
in theſe Weſtern Parts, he cunningly lays aſide the Conteſt about the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
between <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. King of <hi>England,</hi> and his Aunt <hi>Katharine,</hi> and
entred into a League with the ſaid King, of invading <hi>France,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
by the Way of <hi>Champaigne,</hi> and the King thro' <hi>Picardy,</hi> to compleat
the Conqueſt of that Noble Country: In order to which, the Emperor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
as far as <hi>Eſpernay,</hi> which occaſioned ſuch a Terror and Confuſion in
<hi>Paris,</hi> that the Citizens were for leaving the City; if the King by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
had not incouraged them to ſtay: Tho' the Emperor, as believing
himſelf much ſtronger, thought to delude <hi>Henry</hi> of his projected Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the other grew too cunning for him, for being in expectation that
<hi>Henry</hi> would have advanced, and ſo both of them hem in the <hi>French</hi> Army
on each ſide, he ſent him Word, He would not ſtir from <hi>Bologn</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreville,</hi>
till he had made himſelf Maſter of them, which made <hi>Charles</hi>
recoyl and clap up a Peace; then he turned all his Thoughts upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the Proteſtants, and with them the Liberty of <hi>Germany;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
tho' he went a great length, yet he was at laſt ſo baffled by <hi>Maurice,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
of <hi>Saxony,</hi> at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> that he was glad to make a Peace with them
alſo: So that now being diffident of ever attaining his Ends, and wearied
with the Toils of Empire, and the Infirmity of his Body, he reſigned up the
Empire to his Brother <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> who having been before choſen King of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> would not conſent it ſhould come to his Son <hi>Philip:</hi> This <hi>Philip</hi>
had at the ſame time all his Father's Hereditary Dominions put into his
Hands, and being a Prince as Politick as Powerful, and withal Married to
<hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> had it not been for his Father's Error, in dividing
the Power of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family, by ſeparating the Imperial Crown from
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy; I cannot ſee, if we ſpeak after the Manner of Men,
what could have hindred this <hi>Philip</hi> II. from attaining to the Dominion of
<hi>Europe,</hi> in a ſhort time: But beſides this, other Accidents quickly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened,
<pb facs="tcp:62930:8"/>
and as Politick as this Prince ſeemed to be, thoſe very Methods he
took to attain ſtill to his deſired Ends of Supream Sovereignty, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the Inquiſition, and an Arbitrary Power into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and
his Attempts to reduce the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> under his Power, proved
to be the very Things that ruined his Empire, and gave Riſe to that State,
that for a long time gave an helping hand to bring <hi>Spain</hi> low; but ſince the
Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> in 1648. has proved the greateſt Support of that Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Monarchy ſtill continuing in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> againſt her grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Neighbours, of any in the World. We might here aſſign other Reaſons
for the Cadency of <hi>Spain,</hi> as the bloody Inquiſition, the Depopulating of
the Country, by the Diſcovery of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> &amp;c. But waving this at
preſent, we ſhall enquire a little diſtinctly into the <hi>French</hi> Proceedings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſaid Account, and take in ſomewhat of other Nations, as they occur
to our Purpoſe, before we come to draw the whole into a Concluſion.</p>
            <p>The Ancient <hi>Gallia,</hi> which was of every extenſive Bounds, but ſubdivided into divers petty Kingdoms or Dynaſties; as, indeed, the State of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant World ſeemed every-where to be ſo, fell under the Yoak of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, under the Conduct of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and continued under the ſaid
Dominion, till that vaſt Monarchy began to totter, and then was one of
firſt of thoſe Countries that felt the Rage of thoſe barbarous Nations, the
<hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Huns,</hi> but moſt of all, the <hi>Franks</hi> out of <hi>Germany,</hi> who, about the
Year 424, beginning to break in upon it, did by degrees make themſelves
Maſters of the greateſt part of it, and withal changed the old Name of
<hi>Gaul</hi> into that of <hi>France.</hi> The firſt Race of their Kings were valiant and
brave Princes, but ſome of them being too much taken up with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
Humour of thoſe Times, made ſuch a Diviſion of the Kingdom, as
they had Number of Sons to govern them: But being united again, this
<hi>Merovingian</hi> Family, now at length ſtrangely degenerating from their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Valour, gave way to the Riſe of the <hi>Carolovinian</hi> Race in the Perſon
of <hi>Pepin,</hi> and was ſo called from the Famous <hi>Charles Martel Mayor</hi> of the
Palace in the laſt King's Reign, and Father to this <hi>Pepin,</hi> who proved a
Warlike Prince, and did great Feats in <hi>Italy</hi> againſt the <hi>Lombards.</hi> He was
ſucceeded by his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> ſurnamed the Great, who extended the <hi>French</hi>
Monarchy beyond the Bounds even of the ancient <hi>Gallia:</hi> For he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a Manner Lord of all <hi>Italy,</hi> by the entire Conqueſt he made of the
Kingdom of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and overcame the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and ſubdued <hi>Germany,</hi>
beat the <hi>Sclavonians, Danes</hi> and <hi>Huns,</hi> routed the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and reduced
<hi>Spain</hi> as far as the River <hi>Iberus,</hi> under his Obedience, and at <hi>Rome</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
Emperor of the <hi>Weſt:</hi> And, in Truth, he was the greateſt Prince
that ever was in this Part of the World, ſince the Diſſolution of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire; and had his Succeſſors been as Wiſe and Valiant as he, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
the Steps he took, I cannot ſee any Thing that could have hindred them
in the Revolution of a few Years, from erecting an Empire as extenſive and
formidable, as that of old <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. But <hi>Charles</hi> his Succeſſors falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Error of their Predeceſſors, disjoined the Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> from
the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and part of their Dominions being invaded and
poſſeſt by the <hi>Normans,</hi> and the Royal Authority decaying by degrees, this
Race alſo being enfeebled with Age, tho' they were not yet 240 Years old,
made way for <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> to aſcend the Throne. This Man thinking to
<pb facs="tcp:62930:8"/>
make amends for the Badneſs of his Title, by the Goodneſs of his Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
to the Nobles of his Kingdom that had been very Inſtrumental in
his Advancement, remitted a great many of the Ancient Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and gave them the Titles of Dukes and Earls of the Provinces they
govern'd, upon Condition they ſhould acknowledge themſelves his Vaſſals,
but yet not to be obliged to depend abſolutely upon his Commands. Hence
aroſe, beſides the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> on which alſo depended that of
<hi>Britany,</hi> the Dutchies of <hi>Burgundy, Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Gaſcoigny;</hi> the Earldoms
of <hi>Flanders, Champaign</hi> and <hi>Thoulouſe;</hi> to which, if we add, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Vienna, Provence, Savoy</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> belonged to the Kingdom of
<hi>Arelate,</hi> which was part of the <hi>German</hi> Empire, we ſhall find the <hi>French</hi>
Monarchy reduced from thoſe moſt extenſive Bounds it had in the Days of
<hi>Charlemaign</hi> to a very narrow Compaſs, and to reunite thoſe again has been
mainly the Struggle and Endeavour of the ſucceeding Kings of <hi>France;</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſome of which they had a long and terrible Conteſt with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
which yet the <hi>French</hi> effected in a great meaſure, by the Time of the Reign
of our K. <hi>Henry</hi> VII. when <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. married <hi>Anne,</hi> Inheritrix of the
Dutchy of <hi>Britany,</hi> tho' ſhe had been ſolemnly married before to <hi>Maximilian,</hi>
K. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and afterwards Emperor: And the Suffering of this to be
accompliſh'd, was a foul Blot in K. <hi>H</hi>'s Politicks, and leſned very much the
Reputation he had gained of being a Prince of great Wiſdom and Foreſight.</p>
            <p>But, though <hi>France</hi> thus ſtrengthned her Vital Parts by the Acquiſition of <hi>Britany,</hi> which ſhe took Care to retain even by the Marriage of <hi>Charles</hi>'s Succeſſor, <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. to this <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Bretaigne</hi> his Relict, in Expectation of
Iſſue, though without Succeſs; and that notwithſtanding this, <hi>Francis</hi> I.
<hi>Lewis</hi>'s Nephew, did not only retain that Dutchy, but is generally allowed
to have been a Prince, that aſpired not ſo much at being Emperor of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
as Univerſal Monarch of <hi>Europe;</hi> Yet neither would the Conjuncture
of the Times, nor the Strength of his Cotemporaries, by any means admit
of it in his Perſon: And as for the ſucceeding Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Valois,</hi>
tho' <hi>H.</hi> II. made an Attempt to unite <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> by the Marriage
of <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to his Son <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>Dauphine,</hi> (which would have
been a great Blow to <hi>England</hi>) yet no Iſſue coming from that Match, they
were henceforward ſo far from doing any Thing memorable, as to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their Dominion and Conqueſt, that the Kingdom fell into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Civil War; which, though at firſt it had its Riſe from the Humours
and Paſſions of the Princes of the Blood; and the Miniſters, yet it proved at
length to be a Religious War between the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> or the <hi>League,</hi>
and the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> which never could be extinguiſhed, till <hi>H.</hi> IV. of the
Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and, by Right, K. of <hi>France,</hi> upon the Death of <hi>Hen.</hi> III.
the laſt Prince of the Houſe of <hi>Valois,</hi> had renounced the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and thereupon was confirmed in the Supream Authority before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to him. This Prince did anew lay the Foundation of the <hi>French</hi>
Greatneſs, which was carried on in his Son's Reign, <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. (tho' of
himſelf no otherwiſe a wiſe Prince, than by his Steadineſs to his Miniſters)
by the wonderful Management of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> both by Sea and Land,
to a very great Heighth; by whoſe wiſe Conduct <hi>Spain,</hi> long before lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
under a diſeaſed Body, was brought lower and lower; and what
the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. aimed at in the Reduction of <hi>Germany</hi> by the
<pb facs="tcp:62930:9"/>
War that was begun there (being no other than an abſolute Sovereignty) as
well as the <hi>Swedes,</hi> whoſe beſt Pretenſions under the Brave King <hi>Guſtavus
Adolphus,</hi> was to reſcue the Religion and Liberty of it; tho' in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
it appeared to be no other than a Conqueſt of it, redounded in a
great Meaſure to the Advantage of <hi>France,</hi> and the ſame was confirmed
into her by the <hi>Weſtphalian</hi> Treaty in 1648. And all this done upon the
Continent, while we our ſelves were ſeemingly enfeebled rather than
ſtrengthned by the Conjunction of <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' in reality, it muſt be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the weak Adminiſtration of our Princes, which terminated in the
cruelleſt Inteſtine War that ever befel any Nation, and was attended with
the ſaddeſt Cataſtrophe: And the Government it ſelf, after various Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations
of Form and ſubſequent Revolutions, degenerated into Anarchy,
of which <hi>France</hi> failed not to make Advantage under the Miniſtry of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Mazarine.</hi> But our Unſettlement at laſt terminating in the Reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our ancient Form of Government, in the Perſon of <hi>Charles</hi> II. about
which time hapned the Death of <hi>Mazarine</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who left this Legacy
to his Prince, <hi>That he ſhould Govern himſelf, and not entirely truſt to any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite</hi>
tho' <hi>Charles</hi> quickly diſcovered, that the Remembrance of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
and exiled Fortune, which uſually makes Men wiſe upon a Change of
Condition, had been quite effaced by the proſperous State his Reſtoration
brought him to; yet <hi>Lewis</hi> never fail'd to ſtick cloſe to the Advice of his
Miniſter, and what Effects it has had ſince upon the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> is
better paſt over in ſilence, than raked up in this place: However, we were
weak enough to quit our entire Intereſt upon the Continent, by the Sale
of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> which as it gave an Acceſſion of Strength into
that Nation to the Sea-ward, as <hi>Lorain</hi> did to the Land-ward, ſo it weakned
both our own and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hands; as did alſo the <hi>Dutch</hi> War that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
between us and the Republick of <hi>Holland</hi> in 1665, neither Nation
having gotten any Thing but Blows at Sea, while the <hi>French</hi> by the Irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they made into <hi>Flanders</hi> into 1667, got all by Land: And, tho' they
were for a ſhort time coup'd up by the Tripple Alliance of <hi>England, Sweden</hi>
and <hi>Holland;</hi> yet they having Artifice enough to disjoin the firſt from the
reſt, as that alſo did by the ſecond, the third was left ſingle to be invaded by
the other in 1672, and that with ſuch a Torrent of Succeſs, that nothing
but the Providence of God, and the Succeſs of the young Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
now in this Hurry and common Calamity of his Country, reſtored to the
Honours and Commands of his Anceſtors, could have ſaved that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
State from falling under the <hi>French</hi> Dominion. But tho' the Blow
was ſuddam, and almoſt unexpected, yet the Commonneſs of the Danger
not only awaken'd <hi>Spain,</hi> the Emperor and the Empire to come out of their
ſlow Pace to the Relief of it, but the <hi>French</hi> Progreſs ſo alarmed the People
of <hi>England,</hi> that the King thought it high time to ſlink himſelf out of the
<hi>French</hi> Alliance: But inſtead of falling in with the Weight of the reſt of
the Confederacy, which was the Subjects Deſire, and his true Intereſt, he
was contented to ſet up his Mediation of Peace between the Contending
Parties, with the Reception whereof by all that were engaged in the War,
we ſhall conclude this Introduction that brings us down to the Year 1676,
from whence our preſent Hiſtory commences its Original, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends

and ſtoops upon the River <hi>Woal,</hi> that waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the lower Part of the Town, and divides it from
the <hi>Betow,</hi> an Iſland lying all upon flat low Ground, between
the <hi>Woal</hi> and the <hi>Old Rhine,</hi> which is eſteemed to be the ancient
Seat of thoſe People, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Batavians;</hi> and
whom, for their Bravery, and love of Liberty, they took into
their Confederacy, when they had ſubjected all the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parts of <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> It ſtands to the South of <hi>Arheim,</hi>
and is about two Leagues diſtant from it, ſix from <hi>Vtretch,</hi>
which is on the Eaſt of it, three from <hi>Cleves</hi> to the Weſt, and
twenty from <hi>Cologn</hi> to the ſame. It was in the Year 1591, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> for the States, after it had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
a ſharp Siege; and in 1672, fell into the Hands of the
<hi>French,</hi> amongſt the greateſt part of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Towns and
Provinces; tho', to its Glory, it muſt be ſaid, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
the only Place in all thoſe Provinces that fought for its
Liberty. Here it was this mighty <hi>Treaty</hi> was ſet on foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the moſt Serene Confederates on the one Hand, and the
<hi>French</hi> Monarch on the other, by the ſingle Mediation of <hi>Charles</hi>
the II, King of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> (that of the Pope's, after much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62930:10"/>
Delay and many Debates, being at laſt rejected by all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
concerned in the Negotiation) which Treaty ſpun out into
a great length, and of which, together with the intervening
Actions of the War, we ſhall endeavour to give as clear and
ſatisfactory a View, as is conſiſtent with the Nature and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of Things, and compatible to the Deſign of this
Treatiſe, which extends it ſelf much further, even to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Time.</p>
            <p>The Congreſs may be ſaid to have been opened from the time of the Arrival of the Two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mediators,<note place="margin">July, 1676.</note> who were Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temple,</hi> and Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> upon the Place of Treaty,
where they found only Two of the Parties engaged in the War
preſent, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Plenipotentiaries, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of which were exceeding eager to ſet the Negotiation on
foot, and therefore pretended very quickly to enter upon Points
and Terms of great Confidence with one of the Mediators, and
upon Matters that gave Light to the whole Deſign of <hi>France;</hi>
which was no other, in the main, than to procure a Separate
Peace, if poſſible, with <hi>Holland,</hi> and that by the Intervention
of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> without whom they thought it could
not be well effected: And when they found the Nail would not
drive that way, they quickly turned their Battery upon Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary
<hi>Fagel,</hi> tho' with as little hopes of Succeſs. But the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did not ſhew ſo much Forwardneſs in the Matter; for the
<hi>French,</hi> ſoon after their Arrival, demanding Audience of the
Mediators, declared they came to make the Offer of exhibiting
their full Powers into their Hands, not doubting, as they ſaid,
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> being ready to do the ſame: They, upon being
acquainted with that Overture, replied, That it was in the
Choice of the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors to do it when they pleaſed;
but they did not conceive the haſtening of it would gain any
time, ſince they had no Orders to make that Pace without a
previous Concert with their Allies; and conſequently, tho' the
<hi>French</hi> ſhould do it, yet they would, at preſent, neither exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
their own, nor make any Reflections, as might be neceſſary,
upon thoſe of the <hi>French;</hi> which gave the <hi>French</hi> occaſion to
preſs the other extreamly, upon making Inſtances to all their
Allies to haſten the Treaty, or elſe to declare they would enter
upon the Negotiation without them; intimating withal, That
their Maſter was reſolved to recal them, if there was any much
longer Delay, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> promiſed to acquaint the States
with, to endeavour to diſpoſe them to fix ſome time, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
their Orders accordingly. In the mean while, the Allies
found, or took as many Occaſions as they could, of delaying
the Diſpatch of their Miniſters to the Congreſs, while they had
Hopes of hindring the <hi>Dutch</hi> from proceeding without them;
and this they believed might be effected till the Campagne
were over, from the Events whereof the ſeveral-Princes might
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62930:10"/>
the better take their Meaſures for the Conditions of a Peace,
that ſhould be propoſed or inſiſted on in this Treaty; Inſomuch,
that this Diſpoſition of theirs was ſo well purſued, that no other
Embaſſadors arrived at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> till the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd of <hi>Nov.</hi> following,
beſides thoſe above-mentioned, and the <hi>Swede,</hi> who was of the
<hi>French</hi> ſide; nor had then neither, in all probability, but that
about the End of <hi>Sept.</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors gave the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
notice, That their Maſter having made ſo many Advances
towards the Peace, but having been ſo ill ſeconded by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Confederates, and obſerving their Slowneſs in
coming to the Treaty, he was reſolved to recall his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
unleſs the Confederates ſhould repair to <hi>Nimeguen</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Space of one Month: Tho', after all, Count <hi>Kinkski,</hi>
the ſecond Perſon in the Imperial Embaſſie, whether through
real Indiſpoſition, or under Pretence thereof, is uncertain, ſtaid
at <hi>Cologne</hi> till the new Year began; and neither of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues
came in many Months after, without one of which, to
wit, the Biſhop of <hi>Gurck,</hi> the firſt in Commiſſion, Count <hi>Kinkski</hi>
had no Power to agrëe on any thing further than Preliminaries.</p>
            <p>In the mean time ſeveral Actions happened before the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne ended,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> beſieg'd by the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
               </note> but not of that concurring Nature, as to diſpoſe all Parties to promote this great Work in Earneſt. The Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> in Concert with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Princes,
near the <hi>Lower Rhine,</hi> reſolved, about the End of <hi>July,</hi> to lay
Siege to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> the only Town of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Provinces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in the <hi>French</hi> Hands, of all their Conqueſt during the
Courſe of this War; and which, tho' the ſtrongeſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Frontiers, when it was taken by them, yet had been fortify'd by
the <hi>French</hi> ſince it fell into their Hands, with all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
both of Art and Expence; beſides a Garriſon in it of
Eight Thouſand choſen Men, under a daring Commander,
Monſieur <hi>Calvo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trenches were no ſooner opened, but the Siege was carried on with ſuch Bravery, with ſo many, and deſperate Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, for the Space of about Three Weeks, that it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
believed the Place would at laſt be taken. The Prince,
or the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> (who was deſigned for Governour of the
Town, as his Father before had been) were ever in the Head
of the Attacks, and made great Uſe, as well as Proofs, of the
great Bravery of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops upon all thoſe Occaſions.
Many of the Outworks were taken with a great Slaughter on
both ſides, but they were ſtill ſupplied with new Retrenchments,
and them made by all the Art and Induſtry of a reſolute Captain,
and brave Soldiers within. It happened that about the middle
of <hi>Aug.</hi> as the Prince was expoſing himſelf upon all Occaſions to
carry on the Siege, he received a Musket Shot in his Arm; at
which, perceiving they that were about him were much daunted,
he immediately pulled off his Hat with the Arm that was hurt, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62930:11"/>
waved it about his Head, as a Signal it was only a Fleſh-Wound,
and that the Bone was ſafe; wherewith they were all revived,
and the Prince went on without Interruption in all the Paces of
the Siege. But a cruel Sickneſs falling into his Army, weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it more than all the Aſſaults they had given the Town; which,
together with the <hi>Germans</hi> not coming up with the Supplies
they had promiſed, and upon which Aſſurance the Siege had
been undertaken; and the <hi>Rhinegrave,</hi> who, next to the Prince,
was the Spring of the Action, happening to be wounded ſoon
after, and ſo forced to withdraw into a Neighbouring Caſtle from
the Camp, where he died; all unfortunately concurred to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten
the Army very much, and conſequently the Siege grew
very faint; and this not only gave Monſieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to beſiege and take <hi>Aire,</hi> but Encouragement to
march even through the Heart of the Spaniſh <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
to the Relief of <hi>Maeſtricht:</hi> Upon whoſe Approach it was
agreed in a Council of War,<note place="margin">Siege raiſed.</note> that the Siege ſhould be raiſed,
with which the Campagne ended in the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Provinces.</p>
            <p>However, to counterbalance this Diſappointment in ſome meaſure, and to revive the Hopes of the Allies, that the Forces of <hi>Germany</hi> would henceforward be vigorous, and gain ſome
conſiderable Advantages over the <hi>French, Philipsburg</hi> was this
Year,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philipsburg</hi> ſurrender'd to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> about the latter End of <hi>Sept.</hi> ſurrendred up to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Army for want of Proviſions, having been blocked up and
beſieged from the Beginning of <hi>June:</hi> And this indeed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
as much againſt the common Opinion and Expectation,
as the contrary Event did in the Siege of <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Affairs of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> proſpered all this while againſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> who was in Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> and that with much Advantage in moſt of the Sieges and Encounters
that paſſed between them this Summer, and the firſt part of
the ſucceeding Winter; So that the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſeemed to be loſing
apace all that they had been ſo long in Poſſeſſion of in <hi>Germany;</hi>
But the Imperial Forces, tho' joined with thoſe of the ſeveral
Princes upon the <hi>Vpper Rhine,</hi> had for all that made but little
Progreſs in their deſigned Conqueſts there, and were forc'd
to ſeek their old Winter-Quarters upon the <hi>German</hi> ſide of the
River, which was no leſs a true and indiſputed Deciſion of the
ſmall Succeſs of this Campagne, than it was a powerful Motive
to incline ſome of the Confederates to think more ſeriouſly of a
Peace; and particularly the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who began now to grow
very impatient after it, eſpecially in that they found <hi>France</hi>
would make no great Difficulty in granting them any thing in
Conteſt between them, ſeeing they privately made Offers by
their Emiſſaries, eſpecially at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> of ſuch a Reglement
of Commerce as they themſelves could wiſh for, the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and all the Satisfaction imaginable to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62930:11"/>
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> that he could pretend to upon the account of
his Loſſes, and their Seiſure in the Courſe of this War.</p>

all Parties accepted, and that of the Pope's finally rejected, the

by them exchanged among the ſeveral Parties: And all theſe
Preliminaries of the Treaty being thus diſpatch'd, the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Embaſſadors did alſo, by Agreement, put into the ſame
Hands their ſeveral Propoſitions or Pretenſions, which on the

ſhould be eſtabliſhed upon the beſt and ſureſt Grounds that

            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> inſiſted upon the Reſtitution of all the Places they had loſt, and Reparation for all the Damages they had ſuſtained from <hi>France</hi> ſince the Year 1665, whether by Sea or

<hi>French</hi> King ſhould give compleat Satisfaction to all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates;
and by three different Articles demanded the ſame

That their King being, contrary to Juſtice, and the Obligation

his Majeſty had reaſon to pretend, that in reſpect to that
Crown, all things ſhould remain in the Condition the Fortune

which were to continue ſtill in full Force and Power.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> inſiſted, That <hi>France</hi> ſhould give them compleat Satisfaction, and reimburſe all the Charges of the War; and by Four Articles required of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> That betwixt the Two

But <hi>France</hi> on her ſide propoſed, That ſeeing the King
had not declared War againſt the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> but that
his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty, running contrary to the Treaty of <hi>Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
made in the Year 1660, (for Performance whereof the King
was Guarrantee) had attack'd <hi>Sweden;</hi> his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was willing to deſiſt from all Hoſtilities on his part, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the foreſaid Treaty and thoſe of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> were re-eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>As to what concerned <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> (tho', in truth, Things were as good as agreed between them before)
the latter demanded that <hi>Maeſtricht, Dalen, Fangumont,</hi> with
all the Dependancies of the firſt, ſhould be reſtored to them;
A Reglement of Commerce, with a Renunciation of all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
each Party might have upon the other; And as for the
greater Damages they had ſuſtained, and whereof they might
demand Reparation, they were willing, for the publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
to ſacrifice them all, provided Satisfaction might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to their Allies. To this were added, Sixteen Articles
concerning a full Satisfaction to be made the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
in regard to what depended on the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
the Reſtauration of the Fortifications of the City of
<hi>Orange,</hi> that were ruined in the Year 1660, and of the Caſtle
demoliſhed in 1663, the Rights of Toll upon Salt and other
Commodities, as well upon the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> as through the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality
of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Prerogative of Coining Money, of Laick
Patronage for Nomination to the Biſhoprick, together with the
Exemptions, Priviledges, and other Immunities granted to the
Inhabitants of the ſaid Principality, and particularly by <hi>Lewis</hi>
XIII. And as for <hi>Sweden,</hi> they required no more, but that the
future Treaty might contain ſome Regulations, for obviating
the frequent Inconveniencies that happened concerning Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
between the Two Nations: To which <hi>France</hi> on her
part anſwered, That ſeeing the Union that had always been
between the Crown of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>States,</hi> was only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
upon account of ſome Cauſes of Diſcontent, which were
eaſie, in the preſent Poſture of things, to be removed, and for
the future prevented; His Majeſty was very ready to reſtore
the <hi>States</hi> to his former Amity, and to hearken favourably to
all Propoſitions that might be made to him on their part, both
in reſpect to their Demands of Reſtitution, Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> tho'
the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors occaſionally oppoſed the Pretentions of
the Count <hi>d'Auvergne</hi> thereunto, demanding, That his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſate,
and Town of <hi>Bergen-op-Zoom</hi> ſhould be reſtored to all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62930:12"/>
the Rights of Sovereignty, which the other Towns of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
enjoyed, conform to the Treaties of the Pacification of
<hi>Chent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> demanded, That <hi>France</hi> ſhould make Reparation for the Damages his Territories had ſuffered by the <hi>French</hi> Forces during the Courſe of this War; That all
Security ſhould be given him for the ſame Territories; And
that all his Allies ſhould be comprehended in the general
Treaty. But the <hi>French</hi> had no Propoſitions to make to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector,
beſides thoſe that were made to the Emperor and the
Empire, which comprehended the full Performance of the
Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi> And as what concerned the <hi>Swedes,</hi> in
all the Propoſals they made to the Emperor, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi>
and <hi>Denmark,</hi> the <hi>States-General,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
beſides the Renovation of their former Amity and good
Correſpondence, their whole Demands conſiſted in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and <hi>Copenhagen;</hi> which, in
effect, contained the Reſtitution of all that had been taken
from that Crown.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Pretenſions were alſo put into the Hands of the Mediators, Seal'd as the reſt were; but they did not open them, upon the <hi>French</hi> his acquainting them, That
they had not received any Counter-Pretenſions from Court in
relation to that Duke, whereof they believed the Reaſon to
be, that no Miniſter of his had yet appeared at the Congreſs:
Tho' another Pretence was afterwards ſtarted, for the Rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Duke's Offers, from the Confederates refuſing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of the Sieur <hi>Duker,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Strasburg</hi>'s Envoy, into
the Aſſembly; whereas the <hi>Danes</hi> did the ſame by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> for his being an Ally of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> protected by <hi>France,</hi> and ſo ſtanding diſpoſſeſs'd by the
King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> Indeed, their Pretenſions againſt <hi>Lorrain</hi>
had never yet been made ſince the Death of the late Duke,
and would have been hard to draw up by the ableſt Miniſters
or Advocates themſelves; and therefore they thought fit to
decline, and reſerve them for the Terms of a Peace, when they
ſhould be able to preſcribe rather than to treat upon them.
However, they came afterwards to be known; and were to this
Purpoſe, That as Heir to his Predeceſſors, the Duke hoped from
the Juſtice of the King, that he would reſtore to him the
Dutchies of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Bar,</hi> with their Dependencies, his
Titles, Records, Movables, and Effects, taken from him; and
make Reparation for the Towns, Boroughs, Caſtles and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
that were ruined throughout all his Dominions.</p>
            <p>Neither were the Propoſitions of the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunemburg</hi> made publick, becauſe the Miniſters of thoſe Princes kept <hi>incognito,</hi> pretending to the Character and Rank of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors:
But notwithſtanding all the Inſtances that ever they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62930:13"/>
made, no Crowned Head would give way to their Demands.
From all which Propoſals put together, it eaſily appeared to the
World, what wiſe Men knew before, how little Hopes there
were of a Peace from the Motions of this Treaty, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Circumſtances of Affairs; and how wholly dependent it
ſeemed to be on the Courſe and Influence of future Events in
the Progreſs of the War.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Dutch</hi>'s Pulſe beat high for a Peace, notwithſtanding the joint Efforts of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Penſionary <hi>Fagel,</hi> &amp;c. at Home, to ſtave it off in the preſent
Circumſtances of it; and the former's Endeavours, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> to enter into ſuch a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the King of <hi>England,</hi> his Uncle, in relation to it, as
might bring it about upon better Conſiderations, and with
greater Security to the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands.</hi> But it was his
Misfortune to find little Security or Sincerity on that ſide;
and the Project that was ſent him from thence, gave ſo little
Satisfaction, that he reſolved rather to continue the War at
any rate, ſaying, <hi>That tho' he expected a very ill Beginning of the
Campagne, and to make an ill Figure in it himſelf, and to bear the
Shame of Faults that others would commit; yet, if the Emperor
performed what he had promiſed, the Campagne would not end as it
began; that however, he was in, and muſt go on; and when one
is at High Maſs, one is at it.</hi> He muſt ſtay till it is done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Greatneſs of the Crowd which will not let him get
out ſooner.</p>
            <p>But how ſlow ſoever the Confederates were in the Advances they made towards finiſhing this Work, the <hi>French</hi> thought fit to quicken them towards the very beginning of the Year, by
blocking up of <hi>Cambray</hi> and <hi>Valenciennes;</hi> and having provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſufficient Magazines in the Winter for the Subſiſtance of
their Troops, they began to break into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and thoſe
Parts of <hi>Germany</hi> that are on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> with
ſuch Devaſtations of burning and deſtroying, as not only had
not been uſed by either Party ſince the Commencement of the
War, but ſuch as can hardly be parallel'd in Hiſtory; and yet
they ſoftned it with the Name of, Putting the Frontiers of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
out of a Condition of being able to furniſh Proviſions to
any great Army, with which they were from thence threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and the Complaints of the Allies to King <hi>Charles,</hi> of this
new Manner of making War while a Peace was treating under
his Mediation, ſignified juſt nothing: For the Thing was done,
and their Point was gained; which was to prevent the early
March of the <hi>Germans</hi> into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> that would divert thoſe
Forces the <hi>French</hi> reſolved to employ this Spring in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
before the <hi>Dutch</hi> could take the Field, and march to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of thoſe Places they intended to attack.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62930:13"/>
               <hi>Valenciennes</hi> having been for ſome time blocked up as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
the Trenches were opened before it the 9th of <hi>March</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
the <hi>French</hi> King being at the Siege in Perſon; and after
the uſual Approaches,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Valenciennes</hi> beſieg'd.</note> there were Orders given to attack the
Counterſcarp, with the two Half-Moons that flanked a Crowned
Work; and that the Men ſhould make a Lodgment on the Front
of that Work which covers another that is before the Gate of
the Town. But the Troops marching croſs thoſe Half-Moons,
attacked that great Crowned Work both on the Front and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ides, and, after ſome Reſiſtance, enter'd it on all Hands, ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> before them, and purſued thoſe that fled ſo far, that
they gained the Bridge and Second Work; and, by a Wicket,
where they could not paſs but ſingly, made themſelves Maſters
of the Town-Gate; So that in about half an Hours time, that
conſiderable Fortreſs fell into the <hi>French</hi> Hands, which was on
the 17th, Eight Days after the opening of the Trenches. From
hence the King marched with a mighty Army, and with one
part of it laid Siege to <hi>Cambray,</hi> which, after Five Days, Trenches
open, was ſurrender'd to him upon Articles, as the reſt of the
Spaniſh Towns had been, tho' the Cittadel held out ſome Days
longer; While the other part of his Forces, under the Command
of his Brother the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> inveſted St. <hi>Omers.</hi> In the
mean time the <hi>Dutch</hi> having received their Payments due from
<hi>Spain,</hi> and finding the <hi>French</hi> vigorous in the Proſecution of
their Deſigns upon <hi>Flanders,</hi> whilſt the Treaty of Peace ſerved
only for an Amuſement, reſolved to go on with the War for
another Campagne, being kept up to this Reſolution by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and Conſtancy of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in preſſing them
to the Obſervance of their Treaties, and purſuit of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
in the Defence of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands.</hi> The <hi>French</hi>
had no ſooner made a Motion this Seaſon, but the Prince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to do the ſame by that of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Troops, and preſſed
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to have theirs in a readineſs to join him, and with
all imaginable Endeavours provided for the Subſiſtence of his
Army in their March through the Spaniſh Territories, which
the other took no care of. But notwithſtanding all the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
that could be uſed, he was not able to come time enough
to the Relief either of <hi>Valenciennes</hi> or <hi>Cambray.</hi> However,
not to be wanting what in him lay to ſave the reſt, he marched
with the ſingle Forces of the States, and without either Troops,
or ſo much as Guides, furniſhed him by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> directly
towards <hi>St. Omer,</hi> bent upon raiſing the Siege with the Hazard
of a Battle, tho' labouring under never ſo many Diſadvantages
for it; which the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> on his part did not decline.
For, having left a few Troops to defend the Trenches, he
marched with the reſt of the Army to meet the Prince, and in
the way was reinforced by the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> with all
the Troops the <hi>French</hi> King could ſpare out of his Army,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62930:14"/>
leaving only enough behind to continue the Siege of the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of <hi>Cambray,</hi> which was not yet ſurrender'd. Both Armies
engaged with a great deal of Bravery at <hi>Mount Caſſel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Mount-Caſſel.</hi>
               </note> where,
after a ſharp Diſpute, the Firſt Regiment of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot
began to break and fall into Diſorder; but the Prince rallied
them again ſeveral times, and renewed the Charge; yet he
was at laſt bore down by the plain Hight of his Men, whom he
was forced himſelf to reſiſt like Enemies, and fall in among
them with his Sword in Hand, and cutting the firſt croſs over
the Face, cried aloud, <hi>Raſcal, I'll ſet a Mark on thee at leaſt,
that I may hang thee at laſt.</hi> But all that ever he could do, could
not inſpire any Courage into his diſpirited Countrymen; and
therefore being forced to yield to the Stream that carried him
back to the reſt of his Troops which yet ſtood firm; With them,
and ſuch of the reſt as he could gather together, he made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
that wanted little of the Honour of a Victory. However,
the natural Conſequence of this Battle was, the Surrender of
<hi>St. Omer</hi> and the Cittadel of <hi>Cambray,</hi> (which happened about
the 20th of <hi>Apr.</hi>) and a more eager Deſire in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
after the Concluſion of a Peace, ſeeing they had been
left alone by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in this Brunt; and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no great Hopes of the Conference that had been held at
<hi>Weſel,</hi> between the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the Daniſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
Penſionary <hi>Fagel,</hi> Admiral <hi>Van Trump,</hi> the Envoys of
the Electors of <hi>Cologn, Treves, Palatine,</hi> of the Princes of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
and Biſhop of <hi>Munſter;</hi> beſides the Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> who
was there in Perſon, concerning the Operations of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne
on the <hi>German</hi> ſide.</p>
            <p>However, <hi>France</hi> obſerving every Motion both of her Friends and Enemies, and more particularly the Temper of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Parliament, who were mightily allarm'd with the Progreſs
of her Arms, and had Addreſſed the King to concert Meaſures
for the Preſervation of <hi>Flanders,</hi> had ſo much regard to the
Jealouſies raiſed both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> of their deſigning
an entire Conqueſt of the reſt of <hi>Flanders;</hi> that the King, after
having gained thoſe three important Frontier Towns ſo early in
the Spring, and diſperſed his Army into Quarters of Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
went to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> from whence he ſent the Duke of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi>
to Compliment <hi>Charles</hi> II. and to carry him a Letter,<note place="margin">The Fr. K.'s Letter to K. C. 11.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
in ſubſtance; That tho' his willingneſs to come to a
Peace did not at all promote the Concluſion thereof, yet he
was ready, amidſt the Proſperities wherewith Heaven was pleaſed
to favour him, to agree to a General Truce for ſome Years, as
the ſureſt means of reſtoring Tranquility to <hi>Europe,</hi> in caſe his
Ally the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was of the ſame Mind: And ſeeing he
could have no free Correſpondence with that King, he pray'd
his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty to inform himſelf of his Intentions; not
doubting but he was ſufficiently perſwaded, of the ſincere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62930:14"/>
he had to ſecond the good Offices of his Mediation; yea,
and to contribute all that in him lay, for the procuring a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Peace, tho' he might have Ground to expect conſiderable
Advantages from his Armies. There were various Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made of this Letter, and it was generally believed to have
been a Politick Fetch of the French King, to put the King of
<hi>England</hi> upon waving the Declaration, which his Parliament ſo
urgently ſollicited; and Monſieur <hi>Beverning,</hi> the Dutch Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary,
who was the moſt forward of any for a Peace, yet
reſented it to that degree, that he ſaid openly, the <hi>French</hi> were
to be commended, who never neglected any thing of Importance,
nor ſo much as Amuſement; That <hi>France</hi> had given her Blow,
and would now hinder the Allies to give theirs; That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Conſent would be always a ſure Pretence of
ſtaving off the Propoſitions of a Truce, if the Allies ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it; That this it ſelf could not be done, becauſe <hi>Flanders</hi>
would be left ſo open, as to be eaſily ſwallowed up by the next
Invaſion, having now no Frontier on either ſide; That the
Towns now poſſeſs'd by <hi>France</hi> would in the time of a Truce
grow abſolutely French, and ſo be the harder to be reſtored by
a Peace, or a War; That for his part, he deſired to ſee the Peace
concluded, contrary to the Politicks of Monſieur <hi>Van Benning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and the other Miniſters of the Allies in <hi>England;</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always, That notwithſtanding all their Intelligences and
Intrigues there, he was well aſſured, That the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
would not enter into the War to ſave the laſt Town in
<hi>Flanders.</hi> In purſuance of this Confidence of his, he made all
the Paces imaginable to compleat the Work, and ſuch as were
thought by ſome to be forwarder than his Commiſſion, and very
ill concerted with thoſe of his Allies: So that, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Month of <hi>July,</hi> all Points were adjuſted between
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Beverning</hi> began to play
the part of ſomething more than a Mediator, preſſing on his
Allies towards a Peace in a ſomewhat rough manner, tho' but
with very ſmall effect; for there was little more done of any
moment towards it the reſt of this Summer, ſave the Meſſages
that were carried to and fro about the Buſineſs of the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> whoſe Cauſe the whole Body of the Allies intereſted
themſelves in ſo far, as to preſs for an Anſwer to his Pretenſions
delivered in by Preſident <hi>Canon.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> finding now,
that their former Exception, of his wanting a Miniſter at the
Congreſs, would not do, raiſed another to ſtave off the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Inſtances, and declared, They could give no Anſwer about
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> till the Biſhop of <hi>Strasburg</hi>'s Agents were received by
the Allies. Upon this, the Emperor made an invincible Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
declaring, He would never treat with a Vaſſal of his
own, and in theſe Conferences about <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
began to inſinuate to the Mediators, That their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62930:15"/>
never intended that Matter to be treated as a Principal,
but only as an Acceſſary to the Treaty; As they did alſo ſhew
themſelves poſitive in having full Satisfaction and Reſtitution
made to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> before they would conclude the Peace. It
was believed, ſince it was much diſcourſed of, that there was a
new Alliance entred into between thoſe two Crowns at <hi>Paris;</hi>
and that it was by Concert between them, that this <hi>Attenite</hi>
was given by the <hi>Swedes</hi> to the Congreſs. Neither was there
any Deciſive Action in the courſe of the reſt of this Campagne,
which was ended in <hi>Flanders</hi> by a ſucceſsleſs Attempt made by
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to ſurprize <hi>Charleroy.</hi> And if, on the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ſide, the <hi>French</hi> thought they had the Advantage by taking
of <hi>Fribourg</hi> in <hi>Octob.</hi> this Year, by a Feint of the Mareſchal <hi>de
Crequi,</hi> before the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> could come up to relieve it,
the City of <hi>Stetin</hi>'s falling into the Hands of the Duke of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi>
this ſame Month, after a moſt vigorous Reſiſtance of
its Garriſon, left the Scales even as they were before between
the two Leagues.</p>
            <p>The Campagne being ended as aforeſaid, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who had long deſired to take a Tour into <hi>England,</hi> and had to that purpoſe, the <hi>June</hi> before, ſent Monſieur <hi>Bentink</hi>
over, to make way with the King for ſuch a Journey (who at
length granted him leave, tho' with great Indifferency and
Difficulty enough) did, upon the 9th of <hi>Octob.</hi> Land at <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
and rid Poſt from thence to <hi>New-Market,</hi> where the
Court then was, and where he induſtriouſly declined to enter
upon any Conferences about the Peace or War, as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
firſt to ſee the Young Princeſs; which made the King,
to humour him, leave that place ſooner by ſome Days than he
deſigned. The Prince, upon his Arrival in Town, had no
ſooner ſet ſight on that Incomparable Princeſs, our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Lady, but he was ſo pleaſed with her Perſon, and all thoſe
Signs of ſuch an Humour as had been before deſcribed unto
him, that he immediately made his Suit both to the King and
Duke, which was very well received and aſſented to; but upon
Condition, That the Terms of the Peace abroad might be firſt
agreed on between them; which, after many Conteſtations on
both ſides, the Prince would ne'er agree to, ſaying, <hi>The World
would believe he had made that Match for himſelf at their Coſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi>
and that <hi>he would never ſacrifice his Honour to his Love.</hi> He
grew at laſt to be ſo ſullen upon the matter, that he deſired a
Friend to tell the King, That he deſigned to ſtay but two Days
longer in <hi>England,</hi> if things continued ſtill on the ſame Foot;
That it repented him he had ever come over; And that the
King muſt chooſe how they were to live hereafter, for he was
ſure it muſt be either like the greateſt Friends or the greateſt
Enemies. This ſo wrought upon the King, who at the ſame
time expreſſed the great Opinion he had of the Prince's Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62930:15"/>
that he ordered Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> the Meſſenger, to go
immediately to carry h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m the News, That he ſhould have his
Wife. Accordingly the Match was declared that Evening at
the Committee, before any other in Court knew any thing of
it. The Marriage was no ſooner conſummated, but they very
quickly fell into Debate upon the Terms of the Peace, and had
various Diſcourſes of the Ambition of <hi>France,</hi> the Neceſſity of
a good Frontier to <hi>Flanders;</hi> and it was at laſt agreed upon
theſe Terms; That all ſhould be reſtored by <hi>France</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
and Empire that had been taken in the War, the Dutchy
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to that Duke, and all on both ſides between <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Holland;</hi> and to <hi>Spain,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Aeth, Oudenard, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray,
Tournay, Conde, Valenciennes,</hi> St. <hi>Gillaine,</hi> and <hi>Bince;</hi>
That the Prince ſhould endeavour to procure the Conſent of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and the King that of <hi>France:</hi> To this Purpoſe he was to
diſpatch away a Perſon immediately over with the Propoſition,
who ſhould be inſtructed to enter into no Reaſonings upon it,
but demand a poſitive Anſwer in Two Days, and then forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
return; and my Lord <hi>Duras,</hi> a Favourite of the Duke's,
was at laſt the Perſon pitched upon and ſent. But he after the
Delivery of his Meſſage, was prevailed with to ſtay longer than
his time; and, after all, came away without any poſitive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
From which manner of Procedure we may diſcover foul
Prevarication ſomewhere; and ſo the Buſineſs came to be drawn
out into ſo many Meſſages and Returns from <hi>France,</hi> that at
laſt it dwindled into nothing; eſpecially, after the Departure
of the Prince for <hi>Holland,</hi> who had ſpirited the Vigour of the
whole Reſolution; which Departure happened to be with his
Princeſs on the 21ſt of <hi>Nov.</hi> However the News of the Match
had got to <hi>Nimeguen</hi> ſome time before; and if the Confederates
did before this begin to hope more than ever, that it would
not be long before <hi>England</hi> declared in their Favours, they
made no doubt of it now. But it had quite another Effect in
<hi>Holland,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> Emiſſaries
found the Secret of raiſing Jealouſies of the Meaſures taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and Prince upon this new Alliance, as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the Liberty of their Country; and to make it there
believed, that by the Match the King and Duke had wholly
brought over the Prince into their Intereſt and Sentiments,
whereas the Prince went, indeed, away poſſeſs'd of having
drawn them into his; tho' they were all equally miſtaken. But
how different ſoever their Apprehenſions abroad might be of
Things, the King in <hi>England</hi> quite receded from his Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Prince, of entring into the War with all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
in caſe of no direct and immediate Anſwer from
<hi>France</hi> upon the Terms of the Peace; and contented himſelf
to ſend Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> over into <hi>Holland</hi> with a Draught of an
Alliance to be made with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in order to force <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62930:16"/>
and <hi>Spain</hi> into a Compliance with the Propoſitions agreed
on,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1678</label> and to conſign the ſame into the Hands of Mr. <hi>Hyde,</hi>
then at the <hi>Hague,</hi> which was done, and the Treaty Signed
on the 16th of <hi>Jan.</hi> tho' not without great Difficulties, and
much Diſſatisfaction on the part of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who
was yet covered in it by the private Conſent of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Miniſter there in behalf of his Maſter; ſo that the War could
not break out but upon <hi>France,</hi> in caſe of their Refuſal. And
if an imaginary Jealouſie in <hi>Holland,</hi> of the Prince's Conduct
ſince his Marriage, made them very uneaſie among themſelves,
and daily more and more diſpoſed towards a Peace; the News
that came at this time of the <hi>French</hi>'s taking from them the
Iſland of <hi>Tobago,</hi> with all the Veſſels that were in that Port, as
well as their Ammunition in the Fort there, beſides the Death
of <hi>Binks,</hi> Admiral of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and the utter Ruine of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
did no leſs ſenſibly affect them. But what was a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Blow than all the reſt, was the vaſt Progreſs of the
<hi>French</hi> Army this Spring in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> where they
carried all before them, without any Oppoſition in whatever
they attempted: For, towards the end of <hi>Feb.</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King
marching at the Head of his Army, and carrying the Queen
and Ladies to <hi>Metz,</hi> ſeemed to threaten either <hi>Lutzemburg, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi>
or <hi>Mons:</hi> But having drawn the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces that way,
all on a ſudden, and to the no leſs Surprize of the <hi>French</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
than of the Confederates, he croſſed the Countries, and
in ſo much haſte,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ghent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd and taken.</note> that by the 4th of <hi>March</hi> he ſat down before
<hi>Ghent,</hi> which, by his Orders, had been inveſted the 1ſt of the
ſame Month; and notwithſtanding the Beſieged cut down their
Dikes, and drowned part of the Country, yet in a few Days
both Town and Cittadel too were carried; and the Town of
<hi>Ypre</hi> run the ſame Fate before the end of the Month, tho' the
Garriſon made a gallant Reſiſtance. However, tho' all the
Confederates exaggerated the Importance of theſe Loſſes, yet
they could not excite <hi>England</hi> to any ſpeedy and open Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
The Affairs of the Allies being thus ſo much perplex'd
on all hands, and the <hi>French</hi> now elated with ſo many Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and perhaps fearful leaſt <hi>England</hi> at length would fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                        <p>HIS Majeſty's inviolable Fidelity in adhering to his Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, hath induced him never to liſten any Propoſals of Peace, other than ſuch as ſhall give a full and perfect Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> which likewiſe having been abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62930:16"/>
promiſed to his Majeſty by the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi>
who was earneſt to gain this Point, both for him and the <hi>States-General;</hi>
he now likewiſe makes it the firſt Article that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
upon, and without which he cannot come to any Concluſion
upon the reſt.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe the Intereſt of the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> is ſo united to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that it makes a part of the Treaty of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> for the Performance of which, his Majeſty gave
his Guarranty to that Crown; his Majeſty deſires, that he may
now likewiſe be comprehended within this Treaty, upon ſuch
Terms as ſhall be ſatisfactory to himſelf.</p>
                        <p>As for the Prince and Biſhop of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> the King doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely inſiſt upon the Reſtitution of that Prince, and of all his Family, to all their Eſtates, Goods, Honours, and Prerogatives;
and particularly, upon the Reſtitution of his Brother Prince
<hi>William</hi> of <hi>Furſtemburg,</hi> whoſe Liberty muſt be provided for by
one of the firſt Articles of the Peace.</p>
                        <p>For what concerns the Empire, as his Majeſty doth ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ſame Intention which he has expreſſed for its Peace, that he has been troubled to ſee it diſturbed; that it was with
much Concern of Mind he found himſelf compelled to carry
the War thither; So he does yet adhere to thoſe publick Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which he has ſo often made, That he will inſiſt only
upon the Reſtoring of the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> in all their
Points, and to have them once more to be the Means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
Peace to <hi>Germany:</hi> Which induces him to offer this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative
to the Emperor; either that the Emperor ſhall reſtore
<hi>Philipsburg,</hi> and have <hi>Fribourg</hi> reſtored to him; or elſe keep
<hi>Philipsburg,</hi> and let his Majeſty continue in the Poſſeſſion of
<hi>Fribourg,</hi> without making any the leaſt Alteration in the other
Matters contained in the ſaid Treaties.</p>
                        <p>As for what concerns <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince its Intereſt appears to be the moſt conſiderable in this War, and both <hi>England, Holland,</hi>
and ſome Eſtates bordering upon <hi>Flanders,</hi> have further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
their Deſire, that that Crown ſhould retain ſuch a Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> as might be able to make that a Bar,
which they judge is ſo very important to their Safety; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
has been pleaſed, at the Inſtance of the King of <hi>Great
Britain,</hi> to agree to the Means for the Settling of it. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Conſideration it is, as his Majeſty declared himſelf to
that Prince, that he has offered already, and doth yet offer to
reſtore to <hi>Spain</hi> theſe following Places, <hi>viz.</hi>

                           <hi>Gand,</hi> and its Dependances.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Guillain;</hi> but with its Fortifications raſed.</p>
                        <p>For ſo many Places of Importance, and which his Majeſty has taken ſo much Care, and been at ſo great Expence to Fortifie; he requires in exchange, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> quit his Right
to thoſe Places which his Majeſty hath poſſeſſed himſelf of in
this laſt War.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>All</hi> Franche Compte.</p>
                        <p>The Town of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> and its Dependances.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Conde,</hi> and its Dependances.</p>
                        <p>Cambray <hi>and</hi> Cambreſis.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Air,</hi> St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and their Dependances.</p>
                        <p>The Town of <hi>Ypre,</hi> and its Chaſtellany.</p>
                        <p>The Places of <hi>Werwick</hi> and <hi>Werneton,</hi> on the River <hi>Lis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bavay</hi> and <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> with their Dependances.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Poperingue, Bailleul,</hi> and <hi>Caſſel,</hi> with their Dependances.</p>
                        <p>In a Word, that he quit his Right to all ſuch Places and Countries as his Majeſty hath now in his Poſſeſſion, excepting thoſe before-mentioned, which his Majeſty is willing to reſtore
to <hi>Spain;</hi> the Town of <hi>Charlemont</hi> he is willing to give up, or
in lieu thereof, the Town of <hi>Dinant</hi> and <hi>Bouvines;</hi> upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that he, at the Choice of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> will charge
himſelf, that the Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> ſhall quit his Right to <hi>Dinant,</hi>
and that the Emperor and Empire ſhall give their Aſſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
By this means the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Frontier in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
would, for the future, begin from the Sea to the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> by
<hi>Newport, Dixmude, Courtray, Oudenard, Aeth, Mons, Charleroy,</hi>
and <hi>Namur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the Articles which concern the <hi>States-General,</hi> they are ſo very favourable, that they cannot but conclude, that his Majeſty doth fully purpoſe to receive them into the former
Friendſhip, after the Peace ſhall be concluded. His Majeſty is
willing to reſtore them <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and to agree to the Treaty
of Commerce, in ſuch Form as it was framed at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> with
the Sieur <hi>Beverning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And to the End his Majeſty may give the World the utmoſt Teſtimony of his ſincere Intentions for the Peace, his Majeſty, notwithſtanding any Reaſon that might induce him to continue
in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> is willing that Prince <hi>Charles</hi> be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to it, upon one of theſe two Alternatives, of which he gives
him his Choice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That he be reſtored according to the Articles expreſſed in the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Treaty, without any Change or Alteration in any of them.</p>
                        <p>Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he be reſtored generally to his whole Eſtate, except the Town of <hi>Nancy,</hi> which his Majeſty will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62930:17"/>
with Plenary Right of Sovereignty, and excepting ſuch a
Way as was agreed upon at the Treaty of 1661, to paſs from
the Frontiers of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and all ſuch Ways as ſhall
be neceſſary to paſs from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Nancy,</hi> and from <hi>France</hi> to
<hi>Metz, Briſac,</hi> and <hi>Franche Compte;</hi> upon Condition nevertheleſs,
that to make him ſome Compenſation for the Town of <hi>Nancy,</hi>
his Majeſty ſhall reſtore to him that of <hi>Toul,</hi> conſiderable for
its Extent and Situation, and much more in reſpect for its
Biſhoprick.</p>
                        <p>His Majeſty demands likewiſe, That <hi>Long-Wic</hi> and its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſtſhip be quitted to him; but offereth withal to recompenſe the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> with another Provoſtſhip of equal Value
of one of three Biſhopricks. And whereas <hi>Marſal</hi> having been
quitted to his Majeſty by a particular Treaty, is not at preſent
any part of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſo it is not to be underſtood to be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in this Reſtitution.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the Terms which may, and ought to make the Platform of a General Peace, and upon which his Majeſty hath long ago declared himſelf to the King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> His
Majeſty deſires they may be imparted to the Aſſembly at <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen;</hi>
and that his own Plenipotentiaries propoſe them to the
Conſideration of the reſt, as containing the loweſt Conditions
he can admit; and upon which his Enemies may make Choice
either of War or Peace.</p>

            <p>The Imperialiſts, of all others, ſeemed the leaſt inclinable to yield to the foregoing Conditions; and the Strain of requiring full Satisfaction to <hi>Sweden</hi> was inſupportable to the Northern
Princes; yea, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and other Confederates looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them ſo hard, that they ſaid, They would hazard all rather
than accept of them. Tho' after all, thoſe Articles that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> having been before privately agreed
upon with ſome Leaders of the principal Towns, they proved
the Plan of the Peace both for <hi>Holland,</hi> and all the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
engaged in the War. Yet when the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
carried theſe Conditions to Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> then ſole
Mediator, in order to be communicated by him to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
he made Anſwer, He could not do it as a Mediator,
but that he would atquaint the Parties with them in Diſcourſe,
as a matter to which he promiſed no Anſwer; and this he did,
becauſe of the other Terms that had been agreed on between
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> for forcing of <hi>France</hi> to a Compliance,
on the 10th of <hi>Jan.</hi> foregoing; which, tho' they proved to be
of little uſe in the Courſe of this Peace, yet they had one good
Effect upon the Affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> and this was, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the <hi>French</hi> Intriguing in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> the
Fears they had that the King at length might be in earneſt, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62930:18"/>
punctually perform the Conditions of this League; and well
knowing that if it came to that, they ſhould have occaſion for
all the Force they could make, and perhaps find all little enough,
they abandoned <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and all their Conqueſts in <hi>Sicily;</hi> and
that at a time when every body thought the Mareſchal <hi>de Fevil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade</hi>
had been ſent into that Kingdom with freſh Forces upon
the Deſign of ſome new Enterprize: Whereas, indeed, he went
thither to fetch off the <hi>French</hi> Troops that were there; which
he did, after he had firſt declared to the Senate the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the preſent Neceſſity of them; and with whom; a
vaſt Number of the <hi>Meſſines,</hi> who dreaded the certain Revenge
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> took alſo the Opportunity to retire.</p>
            <p>But that the <hi>French</hi> might ſtave off the Blow from <hi>England,</hi>

               </note>
if poſſible, they at length bethought themſelves of a Srrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,
that had more charming Obligations in it, than any other
made with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> when in <hi>England,</hi> or with the
<hi>States-General</hi> afterwards, and that was, an Offer of Money:
For, you muſt know, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> the King's Embaſſador
at <hi>Paris,</hi> after a long Conference with M. <hi>Louvois,</hi> by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
Orders, wherein the Latter repreſented to him the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
that had been already concerted for a Peace upon the
<hi>French</hi> Terms in <hi>Holland;</hi> and that ſince they were agreed
there, it was hoped his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty would not be againſt
it; but that however, he had Orders to make him a Tender
of a great Sum of Money for his Conſent, tho' a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
accepted by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and wherein his Majeſty conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
was not concerned, was deſired to give the then Lord
Treaſurer of <hi>England</hi> an Account hereof by a Packet; which
Offer, tho' very reliſhing at any time with the Humour of our
Court, yet the violent Diſpoſitions of the <hi>Dutch</hi> to run into
the Peace at this time, whatever came of it, and ſuch a fatal
and mutual Diſtruſt as there was both in Court and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it was very difficult to fall into any ſound Meaſures
between them, made the King look upon it as a very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Propoſal; ſaying, That ſince the <hi>Dutch</hi> would have a Peace
upon the <hi>French</hi> Terms, and that <hi>France</hi> offered him Money
for his Approbation of that he could not help, he knew no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why he might not get the Money, and ſo required Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Temple</hi> to treat with the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador about it. But
that Gentleman had more Honour and Honeſty than to engage
in ſo diſhonourable a Thing, and did thereupon retire from
Court. You have heard before, that the 10th of <hi>May</hi> was the
time limited by the <hi>French</hi> Project of Peace, for the Allies to
accept of the Terms or no, and to which they appeared poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
engaged; but there being a Neceſſity of ſomewhat a

ſent ſecretly to acquaint the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors, That
the <hi>States</hi> did accept of the King's Offer. However that he
might not by ſuch a Pace allarm the Allies, he gave the Count
<hi>d' Avaux</hi> alſo notice, That he was very deſirous to diſcourſe
with him in private, and for that end would fetch a Walk alone
upon the Ramparts of the Town about 7 in the Morning,
where they met accordingly, and between whom all Matters
were in a manner fully concluded: The Conſequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was, the granting of Ten Days longer for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to perſwade their Allies to accept of the Conditions
propoſed, as themſelves had done. In this time the Eſtates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Letter from the <hi>French</hi> King, from his Camp at <hi>Deinſe,</hi>
wherein he made ſome further Conceſſions, and invited them
to ſend Deputies to him at <hi>Ghent.</hi> But becauſe the Reader

                     <salute>Moſt dear great Friends, Allies, and Confederates,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>OVT of the ſincere Affection which we have always born to the the promoting the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> we are very much ſatisfied to underſtand, by our Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the Account
given unto them in your Name, by one of your Ambaſſadors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
your Thoughts upon the Concluſion of ſo great a Work,
which you had imparted to them by one of your Embaſſadors. We
are glad to underſtand, that the Terms which we propoſed at that
Aſſembly appear to you to be reaſonable, and that you are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of the Sincerity of our Mind, in a matter of ſo great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:
And it is with the greater Satisfaction to our ſelves, that
we confirm the ſame unto you by this Letter; that notwithſtanding
thoſe Advantages which we have already acquir'd by our Arms, and
may juſtly hope for by the Proſecution of the War; yet we place our
chiefeſt Glory in making all the Steps we can towards a Peace. But
becauſe it appears by the Diſcourſes that have been made to our Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries
by your Order, that how deſirous ſoever you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Peace, yet there remains ſome Scruple with you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the 7th Article of the Treaty of Commerce, which has been
debated at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> between our Embaſſadors and yours; and
Trouble of Mind, leſt we ſhould make an entire Conqueſt of the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> in caſe <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould reject the Terms we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
we are willing to impart our Thoughts unto you upon theſe
two Points. We cannot do it more favourably, as to the 1ſt of
them, than by granting, that the 7th Article ſhould be as your ſelves
deſire it; and in taking ſuch Meaſures with you upon the 24
Point, as may eaſe you of the Fear you expreſs for the Loſs of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
And this we will then do, when <hi>Spain</hi> having refuſed to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62930:19"/>
conſent to the Peace, there ſhall be a Treaty concluded between us
and you, upon ſuch Terms as have been already propos'd with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to your ſelves, and that you ſhall have returned to our Alliance,
and ſhall oblige your ſelves to continue Neuters during the War.
We ſhall be always reddy for your ſake to grant to <hi>Spain</hi> the ſame
Terms, with relation to <hi>Flanders,</hi> which they are at liberty now to
accept: And we are further willing to aſſure you, that in all that
time we will not Attack any one Place in all thoſe Provinces. Thus
ye ſhall always find us reddily inclined, not only to form that Barrier,
which you think ſo neceſſary for your own Safety, but to ſecure it;
and to let you enjoy, together with the Re-eſtabliſhment of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
whatever other Advantages you can expect from our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
And if for the Proſecuting this Negotiation you ſhall think it
neceſſary to ſend Deputies to us, they will find us near <hi>Ghent</hi> till
the 27th of this Month, and in the ſame Diſpoſitions we have
declared to you in this Letter. In the mean time, we pray God to
take you, moſt great dear Friends, Allies, and Confederates, into
his Holy Protection.</p>

him upon the Honour he had done them, by writing
to them; and rejoiced at the ſincere Deſire they conceived to
be in his Majeſty for the Peace of <hi>Europe;</hi> They pray'd he would

Embaſſador, whom they would ſend to him, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him, how deſirous they were on their part to give him
freſh Aſſurances of their ſincere Intentions alſo for Peace. <hi>Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
attended upon the <hi>French</hi> King accordingly, and concerted
Meaſures ſo well, that he obtained a Ceſſation of Arms for 6
Weeks in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the end the <hi>Dutch</hi> might endeavour to
get the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to enter into the Peace upon the Terms they
propoſed for them; which Truce extended it ſelf to the 15th of
<hi>Aug.</hi> following; and, upon his return, he told his Maſters,
(whether really or deſignedly is a Queſtion) That he found the
<hi>French</hi> King as well informed of the Condition of his Enemies,
and of the Places he might attack, as he was of his own Affairs.

up all they had ventured and ſuffered in a War, wherein
they had engaged for the ſole Preſervation of <hi>Holland:</hi> But
that now they were abandoned by them, under a Pretence of
concluding a Peace, and that upon imperious and arbitrary
Terms for them without then Conſent; That they were not
backward to treat with <hi>France,</hi> and make a Peace upon any
ſafe and equitable Conditions, but would never endure to have
them impoſed as from an abſolute Conqueror; and would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
venture and expoſe all, than accept them, eſpecially thoſe
for the Duke of <hi>Lorrdin,</hi> whoſe Caſe was the worſt treated, tho'
ſeemingly the moſt favoured by the Confederates, and the leaſt
conteſted by <hi>France.</hi> Yet for all theſe Storms from their Allies,
the <hi>States</hi> were little moved, but held on their Courſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
little Regard to the Satisfaction of any other than <hi>Spain</hi>
in what concerned the Safety of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Neceſſities
of that Crown made them eaſie, tho' as little pleaſed as the

to Sign the Peace with <hi>France,</hi> before the End of the
Month: And the very ſame Day wrote to the <hi>French</hi> King by
the Sieur <hi>Lanoy,</hi> one of their Officers, who paſſed thro' the
Camp, and delivered a Letter from them to the Mareſchal <hi>de
Luxemburg,</hi> whereby they acquainted him, That they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the foreſaid Orders to their Embaſſadors, at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Signing the Peace; and at the ſame time communicated
to him the Sence of the Letter they wrote to his Majeſty. But
notwithſtanding all this Tendency both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> to
give the finiſhing Stroke, yet an unforeſeen Accident fell out,
which had like to have overturned the whole Fabrick, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the War with greater Vigour, and more equal Forces, by
engaging <hi>England</hi> in a Share of it, in Favour of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
which they had been long practiſing without any Succeſs,
and were quite out of Hopes thereof.</p>
            <p>For in the Conditions which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had made for the <hi>French</hi> reſtoring the 6 Towns,<note place="margin">The Peace obſtructed.</note> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
there was no particular Mention made of the Time of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> underſtanding as well as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that
it was to be upon the Ratifications of the Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>Holland,</hi> whether any other of the Allies on each ſide were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
or no: And the Negotiation had been managed in that
manner till the very Day before the Treaty was to be Signed,
without any apparent Thoughts of a clear Explanation of the
Points; when the Marqueſs <hi>de les Balbaſes</hi> having either found
or made ſome occaſion of enquiring more particularly into the
Intentions of <hi>France</hi> concerning it, bethought himſelf of an
Explanation as to the Time of the Reſtitution of the ſaid
Places; And, in order thereunto, went firſt to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
to ſound their Opinions upon that Snbject; who made
Anſwer, That if the <hi>French</hi> pretended to delay the Reſtitution
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62930:20"/>
beyond the Exchange of the Ratifications, it was a Thing not
meant by them: And thereupon going immediately to the
<hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors, to give them their Explications, which
they would ſend to the <hi>States-General</hi> by an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xpreſs; The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
made no Difficulty of declaring, That the King their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
being obliged to ſee an entire Reſtitution made to the
<hi>Swedes</hi> of all they had loſt in the War, could not evacuate the
Towns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> till thoſe to the <hi>Swedes</hi> were likewiſe reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and that this Detention of Places was the only Means to
induce the Princes of the North to accept of the Peace; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
demanding, that the ſame Powers, who only accepted the
Conditions of the Peace, That they might, as ſoon as they could,
diſingage themſelves from the Misfortunes of the War, ſhould
engage any other Means for procuring that Satisfaction. The
<hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadors, having received the <hi>States</hi> Anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
did, <hi>June</hi> 25. declare to thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> That they
could not Sign the Peace, without the King did remit his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,
and evacuate the Towns upon the Ratifications of the
Treaty. But the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors, on the other ſide, were
firm, and ſaid, Their Orders were to inſiſt upon the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Swedes.</hi> This ſtrange Procedure of theirs, made
the <hi>States</hi> ſend to Monſieur <hi>Van Lewen</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> to acquaint
the King with it, and to know his Reſolution upon ſo momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
a Point, who was at firſt hard to believe it, but finding the
ſame confirmed by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, he was ſurprized,
and angry; and thereupon ſent Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi>
with a Commiſſion to Sign a Treaty with the <hi>States,</hi> by which
they ſhould be obliged to carry on the War, and he to enter
into it, in caſe <hi>France</hi> did not conſent, within a certain Time
limited, to evacuate the Towns; which Treaty, after he had
once fallen into the Negotiation, he concluded happily in the
Space of 6 Days; and the Particulars whereof, becauſe I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaw them yet in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that they may give ſome Light
to this Affair, I ſhall here inſert.</p>

ſo unexpected a Change having obliged the <hi>States</hi> to believe,
That Pretenſions ſo ill grounded were rather an Effect of the
Repugnancy that might be in the Plenipotentiaries, than the
real Intentions of his Majeſty, who had otherwiſe explained
himſelf; and as the ſaid <hi>States</hi> did beſides inform his Majeſty of

                        <p>With this View, and in order to prevent thoſe dangerous Conſequences that may ariſe from ſuch Delay, it is agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty and the <hi>States,</hi> That if their

            <p>After the Treaty had been thus concluded and ſignified to <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Du Croſs's <hi>Meſſage.</hi>
               </note> all the Artifice that could be, was uſed on that ſide to elude it, by drawing the matter into a Treaty, or at leaſt a
greater length; which had ſucceeded ſo well in <hi>England,</hi> that
they offered to treat upon it at St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> then at <hi>Ghent,</hi> where
the <hi>French</hi> King himſelf propoſed to meet ſuch Embaſſadors as
the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould ſend into either of them Towns. But the
<hi>States</hi> were ſtanch, not to recede from their late Treaty, and
continued in that Mood till about 5 Days before the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
of the time; then came one <hi>De Croſs</hi> from <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62930:22"/>
with a Packet for Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> commanding him to go
forth with to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and there to endeavour from the King,
to perſwade the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Embaſſadors to let the <hi>French</hi> know,
That for the Repoſe of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> they did not any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the <hi>French</hi> King to inſiſt upon the Detention of the Towns,
and conſequently hinder the Peace upon the ſole Regard and
Intereſt of the Crown of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and to aſſure them, that after
the Concluſion of the Peace, the King would employ all his
Endeavours, that the Towns and Countries which their Maſter
had loſt in the War ſhould be reſtored unto them. How this
Diſpatch of <hi>Du Croſs</hi> was gained, was never known; but 'tis
ſufficient to believe, that <hi>France</hi> had the greateſt Hand in it,
ſince 'twas tranſacted all one Morning in <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the intervention and purſuit of <hi>Barillon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
Embaſſador. Yet for all this, when Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> arrived
at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> which was but 3 Days before the Expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Term fix'd by the late Treaty between our King and
the <hi>States,</hi> either for the <hi>French</hi> to evacuate the Towns, or for
carrying on the War conjointly againſt <hi>France,</hi> there was but
little Diſpoſition, that the Peace would be Signed; but rather,
the quite contrary appeared, by the Stiffneſs ſhewed on both
ſides to adhere firmly to their reſpective Demands. And the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadors remained peremptory, That there could be
no Deputation for the ſecuring of the future Satisfaction of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> demanded before the Term expired,
and no other Remedy upon that, but that the War muſt go on.
With this View and Expectation all the Parties ſeemed to be,
when the fatal Day came, wherein either a ſuddain Peace, or a
long and bloody War, was to be reckoned on in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi>
on the Morning whereof Monſieur <hi>Boreel,</hi> who had been ſent
from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadors at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> went
to the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors, and after ſome Conference with
them, they immediately went to thoſe of <hi>Holland,</hi> and declared;
they had received Orders from their Maſter to conſent to the
Evacuation of the Towns, and thereupon to Sign the Peace;
but that it muſt be done that Morning: At this, the <hi>Dutch</hi>
ſeemed to be ſurprized, but immediately entred into a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with them thereupon, which laſted for 5 Hours, and
ended in an Agreement upon all Points, both of Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> It was certainly thought
the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors had received no Power to Sign the
Peace; and 'twas ſaid, Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> himſelf did adviſe thoſe
of <hi>Holland</hi> to preſs them to it, out of a real Belief, as well as
the Hopes he had, they could not indeed do it. But the Length
of the Conference did ſo alarm the Confederates, that they
were in a Commotion before it was ended; and yet-more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
touched, when they came to know the Peace was concluded
on, and that it was to be Signed that very Day. And what gave
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62930:22"/>
them a greater Uneaſineſs, was, That they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound <hi>England</hi> now

However, not to be wanting to themſelves, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
of <hi>Denmark, Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> that very Day
gave in a Proteſtation to thoſe of the <hi>States,</hi> wherein they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
That finding them, the Embaſſadors of the <hi>States-General,</hi>
inclined that Day to Sign a Separate Treaty of Peace
with the <hi>French</hi> King, by the Confeſſion now even of one of
themſelves, tho' they had given them no Intimations whereof,
as they ſhould have done according to their Treaties; they
were obliged to lay before them, how diſagreeable this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Procedure was to the Solemn Alliances the <hi>Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> had
contracted with their Maſters, wherein they had engaged never
to enter into a Separate Treaty with their Common Enemy,
who was ready to deſtroy their Republick; and from whoſe
Hand they could never have eſcaped, had it not been for their
Aſſiſtances, and the Diverſion they had given his Arms in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of <hi>Europe</hi> in their Favour; They conjured them by all
that was ſolemn and engaging, not to precipitate the Treaty,
but to give them leaſure to acquaint their Principals with it,
which could be no Prejudice to either Party; That they could
not but promiſe themſelves ſo much at their Hands, eſpecially
ſince there was no apparent Neceſſity to oblige their High and
Mightineſſes to Reſolutions ſo contrary to all that had been
concerted before, after they had exhorted their Allies afreſh to
the Obſervation and Execution of their Treaties, and after
that their Maſters had taken vigorous Reſolutions thereupon,
and agreeable to the Deſires of the <hi>States,</hi> in ſending vaſt
numbers of Troops into the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of <hi>Mons,</hi> which by the Arms of <hi>France</hi> was reduced to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;
and for ſeconding and putting in Execution other
Deſigns which <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> ſhould reſolve upon, under
the Conduct of his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Security of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> in particular. To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the great Bodies that were on their March towards
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> to be employed to the ſame purpoſe, from whence,
with the Aſſiſtance of God, there was room to hope for a good
Succeſs in ſo juſt a Cauſe. But that in caſe the Lords the <hi>States</hi>
found themſelves under an indiſpenſible Neceſſity, which yet
did not appear to them, of proceeding with ſo much Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to a particular Peace with <hi>France,</hi> they did declare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
That their Maſters were ready at the ſame time to enter
upon the ſaid Treaty, and, in Conjunction with the <hi>States,</hi> to
conclude the ſame with the <hi>French</hi> King upon juſt and equitable
Conditions, which in a ſhort time might be agreed, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they on their part, would ſhew all the Facility imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
That they could not but promiſe to themſelves the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
of the <hi>States,</hi> in this particular; and that they could
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62930:23"/>
not think they had entertained the leaſt Deſign of abandoning
their good and faithful Friends, Neighbours, and Allies, who
had hazarded all that was dear unto them, to deliver them from
the impending Storm wherewith they had been threatned, and
for their re-eſtabliſhment in their ancient Splendor and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
at leaſtwiſe they hoped for ſo much from their Juſtice and
Sincerity, that they would conclude upon nothing, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the Intereſt of their Allies, which was in a manner
their own in it; and not concur in the Oppreſſion and Ruine
of thoſe, who had faithfully aſſiſted them againſt ſo powerful
an Enemy, who with one Hand made all the Semblance imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
of the ſincere Deſire he had to give Repoſe to <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
but with the other, refuſed to accept the Means that were
proper to effect it. They added further, That ſuch an haſty
and precipitate Conduct in them was unworthy of a State that
had always governed it ſelf with Reaſon and Juſtice; and that
ſuch an extraordinary Step would be an everlaſting Blot upon
the Honour and Reputation of the <hi>States-General.</hi> But that
if, notwithſtanding all, they were reſolved to proceed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a Neutrality ſo contrary to their Solemn Engagements,
they proteſted againſt that Separate Treaty in the beſt Form
they could; and not only ſo, but alſo againſt all the Calamities
that <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in general, and the Princes their Maſters in
particular, might ſuffer by that Separation.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the Reaſonableneſs and Solemnity of this Proteſtation, and the Irreſolution of Monſieur <hi>Van Haren,</hi> one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plenipotentiaries, who did not ſeem to be ſo clear
in the Point of their Orders; yet Directions were preſently given
to have all-fair writ over with the greateſt haſte imaginable; ſo

            <p>The Day after the Signing of this Peace, came over the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the late Treaty between the King and States, with Orders to Sir <hi>Will. Temple,</hi> to proceed forthwith to ſee the
Exchange of them, which he did accordingly; tho' after the
Counter-pace made by the Diſpatch ſent by <hi>De Croſs,</hi> and the
Conſequences of it, the ſame ſeemed now as unneceſſary as it
had been at firſt unreſolved at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and unexpected
by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who many of them now were as unſatisfied with
the Peace, and eſpecially with the Precipitation of Monſieur
<hi>Beverning</hi> to Sign it upon the ſudden Offer of the <hi>French</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to evacuate the Towns, and before he had acquainted the
States with it, and received new Orders thereupon; as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of that Nation were weary of the War; but the Thing
was done, and after ſome Conteſtation, the City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi>
declaring her Approbation of it, the reſt of the Provinces came
ſoon to acquieſce alſo in the ſame.<note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Mons.</hi>
               </note> But while theſe Matters
were tranſacted in the Cabinet, there was a Work of another
nature undertaken in the Field, <hi>Mons</hi> had been ſtraitly Blocked
up for ſome time by the <hi>French</hi> Army, under the Command of
the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who was ſo confident of the good Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
he was in, that he ſent the Mareſchal <hi>d' Eſtrades,</hi> one of
the <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> word, <hi>He was ſo
Poſted, that if he had but</hi> 10000 <hi>Men, and the Prince of</hi> Orange
40000, <hi>yet he was ſure he could not be Forced, whereas he took his
Army to be ſtronger than that of the Prince:</hi> But the Prince for all
that, and in ſpight of many Diſadvantages from an Army drawn
ſo ſuddenly together, ſo haſty a March as that of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
Poſts taken with ſo much Force, and Fortified with ſo much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
did upon <hi>Sunday</hi> the 17th of <hi>Aug.</hi> in the Morning, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campt
with his own and the Confederate Armies from <hi>Soignes,</hi>
marched towards <hi>Roches,</hi> and from thence reſolved to advance
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62930:27"/>
towards the Enemy, whoſe Right Wing was Poſted at the Abby
of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and the Left at <hi>Mamoy</hi> St. <hi>Pierre</hi> with ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Situation, that they were almoſt thought unacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for, beſides the Woods there was only a Precipice led to
them, and that by narrow Paths. About 12 the Cannon began
to play upon St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and the Prince went to Dinner in the
open Field, juſt as the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> arrived in the Camp;
when Dinner was ended, the Battalions under the direction of
Count <hi>Waldeck</hi> began to act on the ſide of the Abby, and about
3 in the Afternoon made their Attack, the Prince himſelf being
there preſent, and that with extraordinary Bravery, all the
Regiments of his Left Wing ſeconding one another in excellent
Order. In the mean time the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> acted on the ſide of <hi>Chaſteau,</hi>
being aſſiſted by the Prince's Guards, who had the Van, and the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Troops, Commanded by the brave Earl of
<hi>Oſſory.</hi> The Action laſted from 3 in the Afternoon till 9 at Night,
during which, the Prince rid toward <hi>Chaſteau,</hi> where the Diſpute
was likewiſe very ſharp, the Guards behaving themſelves with
extraordinary Vigour, and the Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi> with his Troops
doing Wonders: The Prince himſelf was Ingaged among the
foremoſt of the <hi>French,</hi> who on ſuch an occaſion were not well
to be diſtinguiſhed from the Confederate Troops, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Overkirk</hi> ſhot a <hi>French</hi> Commander, who attackt his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
At laſt, after a great Slaughter on both ſides, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
remained Maſters of St. <hi>Dennis</hi> Abby, having thought
fit to quit the Poſt at <hi>Chaſteau,</hi> by reaſon of the great difficulty
they found to ſecond their Attacks on that ſide. The Duke of
<hi>Luxemburg</hi> finding how things went on his ſide, thought fit to
Retire in the Night, leaving his Dead, many Wounded, his
Tents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> behind him; and the Prince next Morning went to
view the Camp the Enemy had Abandoned, taking up his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
at the Abby of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>
had had his the Day before; But Advice of Signing of the Peace
coming to the Prince next Morning from the States, hindred
the proſecution of this Advantage, which very probably might
have been as much Glorious to him in the Conſequence, as it was
Honourable at the preſent, according to the Confeſſion of a
brave Enemy that was in the Battle, who ſaid, <hi>That he eſteemed
this the only Heroick Action that had been done in the whole Courſe
or Progreſs of the War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince ſent to give the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> notice of the Peace, who thereupon deſired an Interview with him, which was agreed to; and all things paſt with great Civilities on both
ſides, the <hi>French</hi> crowding about a Young Prince that had made
ſo much noiſe in the World, and but the Day before given Life
and Vigour to ſuch a deſperate Action, as all Men eſteemed
this Battle of St. <hi>Dennis</hi> to be; yet many Reflections were made
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62930:28"/>
upon it both by his Friends and Enemies; ſome ſaying, <hi>That he
knew the Peace was Signed before the Fight began,</hi> (but that, if
it were true, could not Prejudice him, ſince he was not obliged
to take notice of it, till he received Advice from the States,) <hi>and
that it was too great a venture both to himſelf, and the States, and
too great a Sacrifice to his own Honour, ſince it could be to no other
Advantage;</hi> others laid the blame upon the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana;
That he had Intercepted or Concealed the States Packet to the Prince;</hi>
but this was an uncertain Report: However, the Prince could
not have ended the War with greater Glory, and with more
ſpight to ſee ſuch a mighty occaſion wreſted out of his Hands by
the ſudden and unexpected Signing of the Peace, which he had
aſſured himſelf the States would not have conſented to without
the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But the Buſineſs was done, and therefore he
left the Army, went firſt to the <hi>Hague,</hi> then to <hi>Dieren</hi> to Hunt,
as having little elſe to do; leaving the States at liberty to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
their own paces, as to the finiſhing of the Treaty between
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> wherein their Embaſſadors at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
themſelves with great Zeal and Application, and no
longer as Parties and Confederates, but rather as Mediators,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> declining that Function, as being a Matter wherein
our Court would take no part. The Northern Confederates
were ſtill mightily chafed at the <hi>Dutch</hi> Proceedings, and tho'
with all their Remonſtrances, they were not able to ſtave off
the Separate Peace of <hi>Holland,</hi> yet they imployed their laſt
Effort now to prevent the <hi>Spaniards</hi> agreeing to that part of
the Peace, as accepted for them by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to that end
exclaimed mightily againſt their Breach of Honour and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
citing the very Articles of their Treaty with them for it;
and ſaid, That what was left the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> by thoſe
Terms, was Indefenſible, and would ſerve but to exhauſt their
Men and Treaſure to no purpoſe. That <hi>France</hi> had no other
Deſign than to break the preſent Confederacy by ſuch Separate
Treaties, and ſo leave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> abandoned by all their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
upon the next occaſion, which they could no leſs than expect,
if <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould uſe them with as little regard of their Honour
and Treaties, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadors ſeemed to deſign;
theſe and eſpecially ſome difficulties that did ariſe on the part
of <hi>France</hi> about giving up the Country of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and the
Town of <hi>Bovines</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as being Matters not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Treaty with the <hi>French,</hi> upon the Score of
<hi>Spain,</hi> before the Peace was Signed, made Matters very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and uncertain, whether the <hi>Dutch</hi> would Ratifie their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Sign theirs. Whilſt Mens minds were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
with various Conjectures and Preſages upon the preſent
Conjuncture, about the middle of <hi>Aug.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hide</hi> was ſuddenly
diſpatcht over from <hi>England,</hi> to the ſurprize even of all in
<hi>Holland,</hi> and more eſpecially of our Embaſſador there, who had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62930:28"/>
not the leaſt Intimation of it; and if the Journey was ſurpri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing,
the Meſſage was no leſs, which is included in the following
Memorial.</p>
            <p>That his Majeſty having underſtood,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hyde</hi>'s Memorial to the States.</note> that a Separate Treaty of Peace had been Concluded, and Signed between the Moſt Chriſtian King's Embaſſadors, and thoſe of this State, he was
extreamly ſurprized at the Manner of the Procedure of the
the States Embaſſadors at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and having ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
thereon, he hath commanded my Lord Embaſſador to
haſten hither with all expedition, in order to repreſent the
ſame to the Lords the States, that his Majeſty cannot find there
is any Declaration, or Promiſe made by the Moſt Chriſtian King,
for the Evacuating the Towns upon the Ratification of the Peace
Signed at <hi>Nimeguen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in the next place, there is no Article between the Moſt Chriſtian King's Embaſſadors, and thoſe of this State, to aſſure the ſaid Evacuation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>France</hi> has retarded the ſaid Evacuation by the new Propoſals ſhe has made to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whereof, there were no mention made in their own Propoſitions, which had
been accepted by <hi>Spain,</hi> particularly, by a Detention of ſome
Places, till <hi>Dinant</hi> were yielded up by the Empire, and by
keeping the County of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and <hi>Bovines,</hi> with other
Places, of which there had been no mention made in the ſaid
Propoſals.</p>
            <p>And as it has been agreed upon in the laſt Treaty, which was concluded and ratified between his Majeſty and this State, that in caſe his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty did retard, or retract
from the ſaid Evacuation, whether upon account of procuring
Satisfaction to the <hi>Swede,</hi> or for any other Cauſe whatſoever,
that the King and this State were obliged to enter into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joint
War againſt <hi>France;</hi> his Majeſty does believe, that the
Subſtance of that Treaty is come to paſs by the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Conditions, and that his Majeſty, and this State were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
obliged to purſue the ſaid Treaty, and to give the
ſaid Embaſſador Orders to demand of this State the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it.</p>
            <p>And as his Majeſty does not at all doubt, but this State has the ſame Sentiments with himſelf, in reſpect to the Mutual Obligation that lies upon them from the ſaid Treaty; he has
commanded the ſaid Embaſſador in his Name, and on his part,
to aſſure them, that if the Lords the States, will refuſe to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
that which was Signed by their Embaſſadors at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi>
his Majeſty 3 Days after ſuch a Declaration ſhall be notified to
him, on the part of this State, will declare actual War againſt
<hi>France,</hi> and punctually put in Execution all the Contents of his
laſt Treaty with this State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62930:29"/>
And his Majeſty having taken into Conſideration thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
which have been made unto him, on the part of
this State, concerning a Neutrality for <hi>Cleve</hi> and <hi>Juliers,</hi> his
Majeſty is ſo ſenſible of the great Danger that may befal this
State, without a ſufficient Barrier on that ſide, as well as on that
of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that he has commanded the ſaid Embaſſador,
to aſſure the Lords the States, that he is ready to Concert
with them; and enter upon all the Meaſures that can be
taken for their Security on that ſide, as well as on the other,
and that it ſhall be their Fault, if they obtain not ſuch Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>When the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was made acquainted with this Procedure of <hi>England,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Hyde,</hi> who went on purpoſe to <hi>Hounſlerdike</hi> to do it, he was no ſooner withdrawn, but the
Prince lift up his Hands two or three times, and ſaid to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Temple,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>'s Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court.</note> then preſent, <hi>Was ever any Thing ſo Hot, and ſo
Cold, as this Court of yours? Will the King that is ſo often at Sea
ever learn a Word that I ſhall never forget, ſince my laſt Paſſage;
When in a great Storm, the Captain was crying out to the Man at
the Helm all Night,</hi> Steddy, Steddy, Steddy? <hi>If this Diſpatch
had come</hi> 20 <hi>Days ago, it would have changed the Face of all Things
in</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>and the War might have been carried on till</hi>
France <hi>had Yielded to the Treaty of the</hi> Pyrenees, <hi>and left the
World in Quiet for the reſt of our Lives; but it is my Opinion, as
it comes now, it will have no Effect.</hi> And, indeed, the Event
proved anſwerable to the Prince's Judgment:<note place="margin">Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Monſ. <hi>Beverning.</hi>
               </note> Its true, all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
for the preſent, ſeemed very different from both the
Proceedings of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> too, whereof many of
the Deputies of the former appear'd ſo ill ſatisfied with their
Embaſſadors having Signed the Peace, that they inclined to the
King's Propoſals, and framed ſeverral Articles againſt Monſieur
<hi>Beverning</hi>'s Proceedings, the five Principal whereof were theſe;
<hi>Firſt,</hi> That in the Preface, the <hi>French</hi> King ſeemed to be the
Protector of the States. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Neutrality to which
the States-General were engaged by that Treaty, was indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
and by conſequence might be extended beyond the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
War, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he had exceeded his Commiſſion, in
having obliged the States to warrant the Neutrality of <hi>Spain.
Fourthly,</hi> That he had omitted an Article of Amneſty and
Oblivion, which ought mutually to be ſtipulated in all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Peace. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That he had forgot to mention the
Barrier, which the <hi>French</hi> King granted to <hi>Spain,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
and for the Security of the States-General: As for
the Embaſſadors of the latter, notwithſtanding, the <hi>French</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſeveral Debates and Conferences, did demit in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
yet they raiſed new Scruples about the Caſtellany of
<hi>Aeth,</hi> and other Things; their Confederates upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and the daily Tranſportation of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62930:29"/>
heightning their Stiffneſs, as well as the Expectation they
had of the States going on again with the War upon this new
Turn of Things. But after Matters had continued for about
3 Weeks in this uncertain State, <hi>France</hi> thought the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of too much Importance to let it hover ſo long; and
therefore, firſt diſpatch a Courier to their Embaſſadors at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen,</hi>
with leave to ſatisfie the States as to thoſe Clauſes in
their Treaty, wherein they ſeem'd juſtly to except againſt <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi>'s
Conduct; And therefore, to cover the Credit of that
Miniſter, who had been ſo affectionate an Inſtrument in the
Progreſs of it; and ſo gradually ſoftning their Rigour, as to
the remaining Points conteſted by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they at laſt
diſpatch'd a Courier, who brought Letters to <hi>Nimeguen</hi> on the
8th of <hi>Sept.</hi> impowering their Embaſſadors to remit all the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
that obſtructed, or retarded the Concluſion of the
Treaty between that Crown and <hi>Spain,</hi> to the Determination
and Arbitrage of the States themſelves; which was a piece of
Confidence towards them, on the part of <hi>France,</hi> that ſeveral
Towns and Provinces proceeded with a general Concurrence
to their Ratifications, that they might lie ready in their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's
Hands, to be exchanged when the Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi>
was Signed, which was done on the 17th, at the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
Houſe, and wherein Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> the Kings Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
had no part; and ſo the Deſigns of the Court of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were once more Eluded, and Mr. <hi>Hyde</hi> had the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to return <hi>re infecta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> is very long, and for that Reaſon, I had Thoughts once to leave it quite out, but conſidering the Treatiſe would have been imperfect without it; and that a
much better Eſtimate may be made by it, of the preſent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Affairs, upon the late Peace, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
could be done, I have altered my Mind, and given my
Reader the Particulars.</p>

ſuch a prudent and happy Conduct, that in leſs than a Days

Forces having marched into the County of <hi>Juliers,</hi> and poſſeſt

of the Elector's Succeſs in the North; where we leave him at

made to attack the Empire, under Pretence of forcing them to
conform to the Terms of the Peace, did ſo alarm the Princes of
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that the Electors of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> with the Duke

Virtue of an Article therein, which gave them Liberty within
6 Weeks to declare, and include ſuch as they ſhould name for
their Allies: But this was oppoſed by <hi>France,</hi> and refuſed to
any particular Prince of the Empire, and allowed only to the
Emperor and the Empire, if they ſhould joyntly deſire to be
declared, and included in the Peace; tho' the <hi>Dutch</hi> aſſured
them, that the Emperor himſelf would e're long, accept of the
Peace, and inſiſted upon it as a Matter that was juſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Article of their Treaty. About the ſame time,

every one minded his own particular intereſt, accepted his part
of the Peace, as <hi>France</hi> had carved it out for him, and choſe
that Alternative offered by that Crown, whereby <hi>Nancy</hi> was to
remain to <hi>France,</hi> tho' this afterwards came to nothing.</p>
            <p>The Treaty between the Emperor and <hi>France,</hi> was ſtill in agitation, tho' it went but ſlowly on; the main Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the free Paſſage of the <hi>French</hi> Troops through the
Empire, whenever they ſound it neceſſary for the Execution of
the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia;</hi> But for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who would
ſtill act in Concert with the Emperor, and therefore, let not
only he Term expire for the Ratification of their late Treaty
with <hi>France,</hi> and even the Prolongation of it agreed to by that
Crown, they were at length moved out of their ſlow pace, by
the Outcries and Calamities of their Subjects in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which
ſuffered ſuch cruel Ravages from the <hi>French</hi> Troops in this
time, that it was a queſtion whether the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi>
were not more ruined between the Signing of the Peace, and
the Exchange of the Ratifications, than they had been in ſo

not exchanged till the 15th, the laſt Term given by <hi>France.</hi>
There were divers other Difficulties ſtarted between the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
and <hi>France,</hi> in the Courſe of this Negotiation, which ſpun
out the greateſt part of the Winter; one, the Affairs of the
Houſe of <hi>Funſtemburg,</hi> the Emperor inſiſting, thoſe Princes

publick Satisfaction, for having eſpouſed contrary Intereſts;
and another, <hi>France</hi> would have the Reſult of the Diet of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishone,</hi>
mentioned in the Treaty; by which it might appear,
that the Embaſſadors of the Empire were ſufficiently Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
to ſtipulate in the Name of the Empire; but at laſt, when
all Things ſeemed to have been agreed on, the Embaſſadors on
both ſides fell into ſuch Heats, and Conteſts about the Right of
the Dutchy of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> the only Point now in Controverſie, that
the Conference ended in a total Rupture, and with ſo much
Animoſity on both ſides, that thoſe who formerly deſired the

to give away nothing that belonged to them; and not to ſuffer
under the Name of a Peace, that the War might be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe Parts of the Empire, unto which the Enemies Forces
were never yet able to advance. Adding withal, that if, the
Imperialiſts abandoned them to the Diſcretion of their Enemies,
they muſt not take it in ill part, if they made uſe of their own
Misfortunes for obtaining ſome Reparation from thoſe who
would ſacrifice them, and their Intereſt in that manner; and
in fine, adjuring them, by the Majeſty of the Sacred <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
that they would conclude nothing contrary to the Rights
of their Maſters, ſeeing they were ready on their Part to

But notwithſtanding all this Remonſtrance, and the Seaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs

the next Day, which was the 2d. of the Month, the Conferences

its Dependances.</p>
            <p>IV. That <hi>France</hi> was to have a free and eaſie Paſſage at all times, from <hi>Briſac</hi> to <hi>Friburg,</hi> and the Proviſions for the laſt Place go unmoleſted and untaxed.</p>

and <hi>France;</hi> but the very next Day, which was the 3d of <hi>Feb.</hi>
that they might not upon any account be wanting to themſelves,
and to omit nothing that might have any ſemblance, if not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
yet of reſentment, made their Proteſtations againſt
it, and complained that the Emperor's Embaſſadors had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to Matters which ſo nearly concerned the Princes their
Maſters, that they had not only neglected all their Intereſts, but
alſo, that they had given their Enemies Liberty to purſue the
War even into the Heart of their own Country; That they had
Treated about the Rights of all the States of the Empire, ſo
far as to aboliſh ſome Decrees concerning them, without the
Knowledge of the Princes who were moſt intereſted therein:
And, in a Word, they Solemnly inſiſted againſt that Separate
Peace, which ought to be reckoned null, and no way prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to their Leagues, nor to the Decrees of the Empire. And
that no Formalities might be omitted, which they judged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for maintaining the Pretenſions of their Maſters, they
did alſo on the 4th, make a Conditional Proteſtation againſt the
Peace made by the Emperor and <hi>France:</hi> They ſaid, That they
could the leſs be perſwaded that the Imperial Embaſſadors
could do ſuch a Wrong to the Princes their Maſters; for that
<hi>Sweden</hi> had been Treated, during the War, as a State and
Member of the Empire, guilty of breaking the Publick Peace,
and in that Notion, cited and condemned by the Empire in the
uſual Form: So that in what manner ſoever the Emperor might
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62930:39"/>
reconcile himſelf to that Crown, they had Reaſon to Proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Validity of that Peace, and at the ſame Time, for all
the Damages their Maſters might ſuffer thereby. The ſame
Thing was done by the Miniſters and Plenipotentiaries of the
Princes of <hi>Brunſwick-Lunemburg,</hi> againſt thoſe two Treaties
in the ſame Terms; not knowing, perhaps, that the Princes
their Maſters were concluding their particular Peace at Home
with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> whilſt they complained ſo loudly at
<hi>Nimeguen,</hi> againſt that of the Emperor. However, that of the
Emperor and <hi>France</hi> was Signed the next Day, as before noted;
as was the Peace between the Emperor and <hi>Sweden</hi> two Days
after.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Embaſſador was ſo enraged at this Peace, that he ſcrupled not the Day after to expreſs his Diſcontent publickly at the Houſe of the Mareſchal <hi>de Eſtrades,</hi> ſaying, and ſeveral times
repeating the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That if the</hi> French <hi>King pleaſed, he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Authority to conclude a League with him, and to get it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by his</hi> Daniſh <hi>Majeſty, who would oblige himſelf to make War
againſt the Emperor in what Manner, and for as long a Time as
his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhould deſire him.</hi> But this Heat blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over, and finding there was no reliance upon the Diſputes
that happened, and Doubts that did ariſe between the Imperial
and <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors, between the Signing and Ratifying
the Treaty, ſo as to hinder the Effect of the latter, they began
to think of another Way: Wherefore <hi>M. de Meye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>kron,</hi> the
<hi>Daniſh</hi> Envoy at the <hi>Hague,</hi> had, upon a View and Foreſight
how Things were like to go, ſome Time ſince, made ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Overtures to the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter there, for an Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
but now he ſeemed to quicken his Pace, and to appear
very willing to have managed a Negotiation with the Count
<hi>d' Avaux;</hi> yet the Offers were ſtill ſo general, that they gave
but little Ground for a poſitive Anſwer; at leaſtwiſe, the <hi>French</hi>
Embaſſador would have it ſo; And therefore, he made Anſwer
in the ſame Manner, as the other <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors had done
at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> that in order to a more favourable Hearing, the
King of <hi>Denmark</hi> muſt begin, by releaſing the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Soldiers,
who, ſince the Time they were Shipwrack'd upon the Iſle of
<hi>Barnholm,</hi> were not only detained Priſoners, contrary to the
Priviledges of the Paſſports which they had, but likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to Violence which they daily ſuffered, on Deſign to make
them engage in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Service, or at leaſtwiſe forſake that
of <hi>Sweden;</hi> That the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhould by ſo doing purge
himſelf of that Shipwrack, which the <hi>French</hi> King was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
inclined to attribute rather to Chance, and the miſtake
of the Pilots, than any premeditated Deſign; but that, in the
mean time, the Inhumane Manner of detaining and uſing thoſe
Forces, could not but be thought very ſtrange. The Duke of
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> alſo; on his part, being willing to neglect nothing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62930:40"/>
that might procure him the deſired Satisfaction, had ſometime
ſince got leave for Mr, <hi>Meinders</hi> his Envoy to go into <hi>France,</hi> to

a Copy of it at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> with a new Proteſtation; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,
That that Concluſion of the Empire was not conform
to the Senſe that was put upon it in the 36th Article of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> and in the 12th of that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's

ſo far from having by that means any ſufficient Authority to
Treat in the Name of the whole Empire; that on the contrary,
the Emperor himſelf was thereby required to conclude nothing
at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> without firſt ſubmitting the ſame to the Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

Majeſty, by adding in theſe Articles, That all, or any Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Reſtitution of all that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had loſt during the War,
would be an inſuperable Obſtacle to the Peace. To this it
was further added, That it was not to be expected that <hi>Sweden</hi>
would make too much haſte to put an end to the War, ſince the
800000 Crowns Subſidy, which that King had allowed him by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62930:40"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> were better to him than the Revenues of <hi>Pomerania,</hi>
and all that he poſſeſs'd in <hi>Germany;</hi> and that if the <hi>French</hi> King
did not by his Intereſt and Authority make the Peace of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
that Crown would never make the leaſt Advance towards it,
eſpecially ſo long as it was ſo well ſupported by the Men and
Money of <hi>France.</hi> Inſomuch, that the Mediator and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
of all the other Princes who had made Peace, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that the Month of <hi>March,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> King had ſet
as the longeſt Delay to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> was drilled
on in Debates and Diſputes, in Writing, without any ſerious
Application to the promoting of the Peace; They could think
of no better Expedient for the preſent, than to procure a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of Arms during all the following Month, not doubting
but in that time, all the Difficulties which obſtructed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of the General Peace, might be removed. This Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was agreed to by the <hi>French,</hi> provided the Embaſſadors of
<hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> accepted of it without Delay: To
which they ſaid, It was neither the Fault of them nor their
Allies, that that Truce was not granted at the Time that they
Signed the Peace with the Emperor, according to the Offers
that were then made them. But another Circumſtance added
by the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors to their Declaration, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the
Inſtances which, they ſaid, were made to them by the Biſhop
of <hi>Gurk,</hi> one of the Imperial Embaſſadors, in the Name of
the Embaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> for a Suſpenſion
of Arms, made theſe two latter think themſelves ſo ſenſibly
touched in their Honour, that they took a great deal of Pains to
make the contrary appear, affirming, They had never either
deſired or rejected the Ceſſation of Arms; but nevertheleſs,
that they might remit nothing that might have any probability
of tending to promote the Peace, they accepted the Truce upon
ſuch Conditions as ſhould, on both ſides, be agreed on. At
length this Procedure, and ſome little Conteſts, ended in Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Treaty of Truce the laſt Day of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> to
continue to the 1ſt of <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truce being thus Signed, inſtead of advancing the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, did on the contrary ſtop the Courſe thereof, during the whole Time it laſted, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
immoveable to their Declarations; there was no more to be
ſaid, ſo that the two Princes who remained ſtill in the War,
thought it more adviſeable to Negotiate the Peace in <hi>France,</hi>
and gave their Envoys Mr. <hi>Meinder,</hi> and Mr. <hi>de Mayerkron,</hi> (the
laſt whereof had Orders to go thither, from <hi>Holland</hi> without
delay,) their Inſtructions accordingly, but with as little Succeſs
as before, either there or any where elſe; ſo that the <hi>French</hi>
Forces that were in the Country of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juliers,</hi> finding
the Truce expired, were ſo forward as not to ſlip any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

the <hi>Auger,</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he thought fit to Retreat; and the

or purſue the Enterprize he had had in View. Here it
was agreed between them, that the Truce ſhould be prolonged
for 15 Days more, to begin the 4th of the Month, which
lengthened out the Ceſſation of Arms till the 19th, but upon
Condition that <hi>Weſel</hi> and <hi>Leipſtadt,</hi> ſhould be put into the <hi>French</hi>

                  <p>IT is impoſſible but that your Majeſty; according to the Great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom wherewith God has endowed you, does eaſily perceive the Moderation and Juſtice of my Pretenſions: And it being ſo, that
you muſt offer Violence to that Generoſity and Greatneſs of Soul,
which is natural to your Majeſty, in forcing me to Conditions of
Peace that are not only injurious to me, but ignominious alſo. God,
who is Juſt, ſeeing the Righteouſneſs of my Cauſe, hath proſpered
my Arms with the Conqueſt of all <hi>Pomerania;</hi> and your Majeſty
makes me give back the greateſt part of it, which I put into your
Hands, that I may preſerve the reſt, which is but a ſmall Matter
in reſpect of what I have gained with the Loſs of my Blood, and
the Ruine of my Subjects. Is it not juſt, my Lord, that ſince your
Majeſty obliges me to part from ſo great and fair Cities, and ſo
much of my Enemies Country, you ſhould likewiſe oblige the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62930:41"/>
                     <hi>Swedes</hi> to leave me the reſt; and that your Majeſty having ſo far
concerned your ſelf for the Party that had no Right to demand any
thing, ſhould concern your ſelf alſo for him who had Right to keep
all, but yields the greateſt part meerly in Conſideration of your
Majeſty? I am informed, that your Miniſters object to me the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of your Glory and Honour; and know that that is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Motive to animate a Great Soul to Vndertakings. But ſuffer
me to put you in mind, That Juſtice is the Source and Rule of
Glory: And that I having it on my ſide, it is far greater and more
ſolid Glory to Support a juſt and moderate Pretenſion, than to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
one that is nothing leſs. And could your Majeſty but hear
the Diſcourſe of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and weigh it with the Reaſons that
Intereſts ſuggeſt to you from my Enemies, I am confident you
would inſtantly decide in my Favour, and ſo prevent the Judgment
of diſintereſted Poſterity. Withal, my Lord, I am very ſenſible
that the Match is too unequal betwixt your Majeſty's Forces and
mine, and that I am unable to reſiſt a King, who alone hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Burden of a War againſt the greateſt Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and hath with ſo much Glory and Succeſs, gone through with it:
But can your Majeſty find any Advantage in the Ruine of a Prince,
who is ſo deſirous to ſerve you; and who being preſerved, may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to your Service more than a bare willingneſs? Your Majeſty will
certainly be the firſt that will regret my Ruine, ſince you cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
find in all the World beſides, one who is more really, and with
greater Reſpect and Zeal than my ſelf, <hi>Your Majeſty's,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>But for all this, the <hi>French</hi> King ſeemed to be inexorable, and his Forces began already to ſpread themſelves in the Mark of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> and freſh Troops, with Ammunition and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
came daily to <hi>Weſel,</hi> to augment the Army which the
Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> was to command; which, upon the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Truce, drew near to the Neighbourhood of <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
beginning to ſtreighten that Place, where General <hi>Spaen</hi>
pretended to make a vigorous Reſiſtance. Hereupon the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de Crequi</hi> ordered Monſieur <hi>Calvo</hi> to paſs the <hi>Weſer</hi> with
a Party of Horſe and Foot, on a Bridge of Boats which he had
cauſed to be made, whilſt he himſelf, with a Body of Horſe, went
to croſs it at a Ford, which, with ſome Difficulty, he paſſed
over, with an intent to make the Country pay the Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he had demanded; but finding General <hi>Spaen</hi> was come out
of the Town with a Body of about 3000 Men, and ſome Field-Pieces,
he attack'd them vigorouſly, and the Diſpute was very
ſharp, and ended with the loſs of a great many Men on both ſides;
and at laſt General <hi>Spain</hi> retired into <hi>Minden.</hi> This was the
20th <hi>June,</hi> 1679. and the laſt Action that put an end to ſo
great a War; and if the Negotiation of the Peace, which was
Signed at St. <hi>Germains</hi> the Day before, had been a little more
haſtned, the News of it had come in time to have ſaved a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62930:42"/>
great many brave Mens Lives, by preventing that Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The main Purport of this Peace, was, The Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphailia,</hi> without any Derogation
from them, except in a few Particulars, and that for avoiding
thoſe Differences which commonly ariſe among Princes about
the Confuſion of Limits.</p>
            <p>But the Reader will be better pleaſed to have the diſtinct Particulars, and they are theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>I. THAT there ſhall be a firm and laſting Peace between them, and free Commerce by Land and Water.</p>
            <p>II. All Hoſtilities to ceaſe within 10 Days, after the Exchange of the Ratification.</p>
            <p>III. A general Oblivion of all that is paſt.</p>
            <p>IV. The Treaties of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſnuburg</hi> to remain in full Force.</p>
            <p>V. The Elector to reſtore to <hi>Sweden</hi> all he has taken in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi>
during this War, as <hi>Stetin, Straelſond,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>VI. But that the Lands on the other ſide the River <hi>Oder,</hi> ſhall remain in Sovereignty to the Elector.</p>
            <p>VII. That <hi>Golnow</hi> ſhall at preſent remain in the Hands of the Elector, he paying 50000 Crowns to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
who, upon payment of that Sum, ſhall have the ſame reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to him.</p>
            <p>VIII. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> quits the Toll, which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Colberg,</hi> and other Places in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> purſuant to the Treaty made at <hi>Stetin,</hi> 1653.</p>
            <p>IX. Quits likewiſe all Rights and Revenues of the Lands on the other ſide of the <hi>Oder,</hi> which remains by this Peace to the Elector.</p>
            <p>X. Frees the Inhabitants of the Oath of Allegiance by them taken to him.</p>
            <p>XI. The River <hi>Oder</hi> to remain in Sovereignty to <hi>Sweden;</hi>
and the Elector is not to build any Forts or ſtrong Holds on it, as
far as the Territory of <hi>Sweden</hi> reaches.</p>
            <p>XII. The moſt Chriſtian King ſhall, preſently after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the Ratification, draw his Forces out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Places of the Elector, except 1000 Horſe, who are to
remain in <hi>Weſel</hi> and <hi>Lipſtadt,</hi> till the Peace be entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>XIII. That the Elector ſhall draw his Forces out of the Field; but becauſe the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> wants Troops, the Elector ſhall keep Gariſons in the Places in <hi>Pomeren, viz.</hi> 2000 Men at
<hi>Straelſond,</hi> 1200 or 1000 in <hi>Stetin,</hi> and ſo in other Places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable,
till ſuch time as <hi>Sweden</hi> ſends over Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62930:42"/>
XIV. That the Elector may take away the Cannon and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
he hath brought into thoſe Places, but muſt leave
what he found there.</p>
            <p>XV. That all Endeavours ſhall be uſed to make the Peace with <hi>Denmark;</hi> and that, in the mean time, the Elector ſhall not give that Crown any Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>XVI. The moſt Chriſtian King obliges himſelf to procure the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Ratifications of this Treaty in 3 Months; and, as long as it is wanting, the Elector is not obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
the Places above-mentioned. The Ratification between,
<hi>France</hi> and the Elector to be exchanged in a Month.</p>
            <p>But <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the <hi>States.</hi>
               </note> ſomewhat to ſweeten theſe hard Conditions put upon this Gallant Prince, the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> in parting with ſuch large Conqueſts as he had made in the Courſe of this
War upon the <hi>Swede,</hi> promiſed, by a Separate Article, to pay,
or cauſe to be paid unto him the Sum of 300000 Crowns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the re-imburſing, in ſome manner, the vaſt Charges he
had been at in making and proſecuting the ſaid Conqueſts. The
Elector had no ſooner made up Matters, upon theſe hard Terms,
with his Enemies; but he bethinks himſelf of trying, whether
his forſaken Friends, who were the main Occaſions to bring him
to it, would at all conſider him: And therefore he writes a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the <hi>States-General,</hi> wherein he did ſet forth, That in the
deplorable Condition his Country's Intereſts in <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> were
in at that preſent, it might be eaſily judged, whether he had
more Reaſon to complain of thoſe, who, as Enemies, had thus
fallen upon him; or of thoſe, for whoſe ſake All that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to him; who, inſtead of giving him the Aſſiſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by their Treaties, had neglected them, and made a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Peace, thereby as well abandoning his, as their own
Affairs, and laying upon him the whole Burden of the War, in
which he ſhould have had no part, had it not been for his Deſire
to help his Friends in their Misfortunes; as if it had been a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
to their High and Mightineſſes, to ſee him who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
with all his Might to ſave them from utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
as a Recompence, totally ruined; That he did not
think it neceſſary to ſet before them more Particulars of what he
had ſuffered for his aſſiſting them, and how his Countries of
<hi>Cleves, Mark, Ravensberg,</hi> and <hi>Minden,</hi> in ſight of their Armies,
had been quite ruined and deſolated; which they had already
underſtood from his Miniſters, according to the Orders he had
given them; That he had expected they would have returned
him an Anſwer to the Letter, in which he adviſed them of the
Dangers that threatned him, and deſired their Aſſiſtance, that
ſo at leaſt he might have had the Comfort to ſee the Concern
they had for his Misfortunes; which he had the more Reaſon
to expect, for that it could not but be yet freſh in their High and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62930:43"/>
Mightineſſes Memory, how in their greateſt Neceſſity he had
hazarded all for them, and preferred their Friendſhip before
the moſt advantagious Conditions that were offered him; That
their High and Mightineſſes would, according to their great
Wiſdom, comprehend, that he ought not to bear theſe ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Damages for their ſake, without Compenſation; and
that, according to all Right, he ought to expect the ſame, and
his Indemnity from thoſe who might and ought to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
them; That therefore he wrote to their High and
Mightineſſes that Letter, that they might not think that he had
ſwallowed their unjuſt Proceedings, or quitted the Obligations
his Alliance with them, laid upon them: But that, as he on his
part, had always performed his Promiſes and Engagements, and
done even more than they required; ſo he expected the like
from them, or in Default thereof, Satisfaction for the ſame;
and reſerved to himſelf, and to his Poſterity, all the Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
thereunto: That he prayed God to preſerve them from
all Misfortunes, and hoſtile Invaſions for the future; that ſo
they might not, to their great Prejudice, come to know the
Conſequence of forſaking faithful Friends. The States, who
had once before failed in that reſpect that was due to the Elector,
by not anſwering his former Letter, would not offend further
in that Particular, by turning a deaf Ear to this alſo; tho' in
Subſtance, the Elector had as good as have received no Reply
at all. However, they acknowledged, in the firſt place, the
great Services the Elector had rendred their State, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in the late War, aſſuring him, That they would always
keep the ſame freſh in Memory, and make all ſuitable Returns,
as it ſhould be in their Power. Then they let him ſee how that
they themſelves had not been wanting, during the Courſe of
the War, to ſupport, to the utmoſt of their Abilities, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſts; That if the reſt of the Allies had done the like,
Things might have had a better Iſſue: That they were ſorry
they were forced, thro' the Neceſſity of their Affairs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Peace upon the Terms they did; but that when they
ſaw the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> ready to be loſt, themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
their Inhabitants ruin'd for want of Trade, and no
longer able to bear the Burden of the War, they had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to accept of the Conditions offered by <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Spain</hi>
likewiſe had done: That ſince the Peace, they had laboured all
they could, to obtain a Neutrality for his Countries of <hi>Cleve</hi> and
<hi>Mark,</hi> but to no purpoſe, <hi>France</hi> having ſtill refuſed it; And,
in Concluſion, deſired he would continue his Friendſhip with
them, which they ſhould always cultivate on their part, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſincere and true Allies.</p>
            <p>This is all the Satisfaction that Noble Elector could have for all the Damages he had ſuſtained; Things were now in another Poſture with the States, being menaced with no apparent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62930:43"/>
from any Quarter. However, they did afterward make him
ſome little ſort of Compenſation, by paying ſome Arrears of
Subſidies due to him upon the Account of his Aſſiſtance in the
War, with which he was forced to ſit down, and content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be quiet. But it was not the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi>
alone that thought himſelf aggrieved, by the Proceedings of
the States, and ſo wanted Reparation, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo
put in a great Claim,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht</hi> of the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </note> and that was the Reſtitution of <hi>Maeſtricht</hi>
up to them. You are to underſtand, that when the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
(who were one of the firſt) came in to the States Aſſiſtance,
againſt <hi>France,</hi> in this War; it was ſtipulated between theſe
Two Powers, among other Things, That <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> ſhould be
delivered to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whenever the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould be in a
Condition to do ſo, (for it was then in the <hi>French</hi> Hands) in
Conſideration of ſo timely a Relief from them, againſt ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
an Enemy. But for all this, the <hi>Dutch</hi> taking no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that Article, after they had made their Peace with
<hi>France;</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> now at length were pleaſed to mind them
of it, by ſeveral Memorials delivered in by their Embaſſador,
M. <hi>de Lyra:</hi> Yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> knowing well, whom they had to
deal with,<note place="margin">The States Anſwer.</note> in ſome time, made no Difficulty to anſwer; That
they did very readily acknowledge the Aſſiſtance they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from his Catholick Majeſty, in the Beginning of the
War; during the Courſe of which, the States were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſupport the common Intereſts to the utmoſt of their
Power; That they were willing to own, that by the Alliance
made between the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and them, in the Year 1673,
they ought to deliver <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> to his Majeſty; but that the
ſame Treaty likewiſe obliged him to the Obſervance of the
Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and all the Stipulations made in conſequence
thereof; and that accordingly, his Majeſty lay under an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
to make good the Agreement concerning the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> and to ſatisfie the Debt, which, with the Intereſt,
amounted to near 8000000 of Livres, due to his Highneſs, by
Virtue thereof: That the States had, during the War, cauſed
a Squadron of Men of War to be fitted out for the Service of
<hi>Sicily;</hi> and that great Arrears were ſtill remaining due to the
Admiralties upon that Account; and that therefore they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Majeſty to give them and the Prince Satisfaction in theſe
Points, and then they would be ready, on their ſide, to comply
with the Obligation of their Treaty, and to reſtore <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht.</hi>

himſelf much ſurprized, that after the Sollicitation of near 10
Months, and ſo many Memorials put in by him, he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an Anſwer ſo little ſuitable to the great Aſſiſtances (even
preceding the Treaty of 1673,) given the States by the Crown
of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Beginning of the late War; That the Offer of
<hi>Maeſtricht</hi> was then made voluntary by the States, as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62930:44"/>
of the ſame, which they ought therefore the
rather to make good. For that which concerned the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> the Debt had never been denied, and great Sums had
been paid upon that Account, and that the Millions which the
Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> had expended, during the late War, in Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and Maintenance of Foreign Troops, would more than
have ſatisfied his Highneſs's Pretenſions: That the Crown of
<hi>Spain</hi> did readily acknowledge the great Obligations they the
States had to his Highneſs, for the eminent Services he had
rendred them on ſo many Occaſions; That in Satisfaction of his
Debt, the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> had aſſign'd him an 100000 Crowns
at each Return of the Galeons, and 50000 Crowns of Annual
Rents in the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> That as to what was owing to the
Admiralties, all Care ſhould be taken to ſatisfie the ſame: That
<hi>Maeſtricht</hi> would be of very great Advantage to the Crown of
<hi>Spain,</hi> but none to the States, being ſo far from their Frontiers;
And concluded all with telling them. He knew not how the
King his Maſter would reſent this their Proceeding, or what he
might reſolve upon, in return thereof, concerning the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Effects;<note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador reſents it.</note> For, that he was ignorant whether his Majeſty would
act therein, according to his Royal Goodneſs, or according to
the Juſtice and Right of the Thing. The Miniſter, indeed,
<hi>Don Emanuel de Lyra,</hi> might reſent the Proceedings of the
States, tho' to his own Damage, as he did in refuſing their uſual
Preſent to Embaſſadors; but the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> proved of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Temper, knowing well the craſie Conſtitution of their
State at that time; and that they were not in a Condition to
procure Satisfaction for the ſuppoſed Injury. However, the
States endeavoured the Year following to make them ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
by mediating between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> a Remiſſion
of the former's Pretenſions to the Title of Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
which the latter always poſſeſt till this Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen;</hi>
And which, notwithſtanding the great Deference the <hi>French</hi>
King ſeemed to have to the Interpoſition of the States, the
Catholick King, under the ſpecious Pretences of being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to take away all Occaſion that might be made uſe of to
diſturb the Peace, and from the particular Regard he had to the
Inſtances of the States (who ſollicited both Parties in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half)
totally remitted to the <hi>French</hi> King, who from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

            <p>There remained now no Negotiation undecided, but that of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> towards the compleating of which Conferences had been daily ſet on foot at <hi>Lounden</hi> in <hi>Schonen:</hi>
But the Negotiation which <hi>M. de Mayerkron</hi> had begun at the

               <hi>XVI.</hi> The moſt Chriſtian King promiſes to ratifie the ſame within 6 Weeks.</p>
            <p>But of all other Points conceded by the <hi>Dane</hi> in this Treaty, none ſeemed ſo hard as this laſt relating to the Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein Gottorp,</hi> who, for being an Ally in this War to the <hi>Swede,
Denmark</hi> had ſtripped of all his Dominions, but is now forced
to re-inſtate him in as ample Form as could be, and he pretend
to, unleſs it were the Damage which his Territories had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
during the War, by the vaſt Sums of Money which the
King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had raiſed therein, as being one of the beſt
Countries in all the North. And thus ended this long and
bloody War in <hi>Europe,</hi> but with as much Diſſatisfaction to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the Allies, as it was advantageous to <hi>France,</hi> who was
left in a Condition by it to do what ſhe would, as we ſhall have
occaſion to note hereafter. It was very hard upon all the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
harder yet to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> but to none
more than the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who had no manner of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
for all the Conqueſts he had made in the Courſe of
it; and I think, was no leſs diſhonourable to <hi>England</hi> every
way, whoſe Mediation, though continued even to the laſt, yet
through ſome evil Aſpect or other, had not the Happineſs of
Signing any one of the Treaties. And as for the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
as he had nothing in Poſſeſſion, ſo he loſt nothing but his
Expectation, which, in the Sequel, appeared to be ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
tho' upon the direct and frequent Engagements both of the
Confederates and Mediator. And ſo that noble, tho' unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Prince, was wholly left out of the Treaty, and without
any viſible Hopes of ever recovering the Dominion of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.
And here we ſhall at preſent leave it, and return to
ſee what has been doing all this while in <hi>England.</hi>

About the 29th of <hi>Sept.</hi> the preceding Year, which was 1678,
Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> ſeconded after by <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Kirby,</hi> made a Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of an horrid Plot,<note place="margin">Popiſh Plot diſcovered.</note> carried on by Jeſuits, and others of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Communion, againſt the Life and Perſon of the King,
Proteſtant Religion, and Eſtabliſhed Government; and for a
further Confirmation of his Teſtimony, <hi>Oats</hi> referred himſelf
to <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Papers, who was Secretary to the then Dutcheſs
of <hi>York:</hi> But though the Court could not but enquire into the
Truth of this, yet they made ſuch ſlow Paces in it, that <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
had time enough to convey away all the Papers of the 2 laſt
Years, with his Book of Entries of them. However, thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that were found, amazed the major part of the Council,
and thereupon ſeveral Perſons were examined and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> the Queen's Phyſician, <hi>Coleman,
Langborn</hi> of the <hi>Inner-Temple, Tho. Whitebread,</hi> Provincial of
the Jeſuits in <hi>England, James Corker</hi> and <hi>Thomas Pickering,</hi> all
Jeſuits, Prieſts and Monks, with divers others. And not long
after <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Powis, William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford, Henry</hi>
Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder, William</hi> Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Lord
<hi>Bellaſis,</hi> were ſent Priſoners, upon the ſame Account, to the
Tower of <hi>London.</hi> But, tho' theſe and other Circumſtances
made the Matter pretty clear, yet the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Godfrey,</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace, before whom ſome of the
Depoſitions had been taken, and who appear'd zealous againſt
all Male Practices againſt the King and Government, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>viz.</hi> on the 12th of <hi>Oct.</hi> rendred the Conſpiracy in the
Sight of moſt Men, to be paſt all doubt: And therefore, the
Parliament, who met upon the 21 ſt of <hi>Oct.</hi> after having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Secret Committee, to enquire into the Bottom of the Plot,
did, upon the 1ſt of <hi>Nov.</hi> following, come to this Reſolution,
<hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> 
               <q>That upon the Evidence that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
appeared to this Houſe, this Houſe is of Opinion, that
there hath been, and ſtill is, a damnable Helliſh Plot, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and carried on by Recuſants, for aſſaſſinating and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the King, ſubverting the Government, and rooting
out and deſtroying the Proteſtant Religion.</q>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Godfrey</hi> murdered.</note> I am not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
what Artifices have been uſed to ridicule this Plot in all
the Parts of it, and particularly ſo far as it relates to the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey:</hi> But there are ſome Things ſo
particular herein for evincing, That that Gentleman fell a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
through Popiſh Cruelty, and yet not commonly known,
that I ſhall take notice of them in this place. There was one
<hi>Prance,</hi> a Papiſt by Religion, and a Silverſmith by Trade, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
near <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and one that wrought for the Prieſts
and others in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> who, ſome time after the ſaid
Murder, being obſerved to abſcond from his Houſe for ſeveral
Days by his Neighbours; ſome of them repreſented the ſame
to ſome Parliament-Men, with other circumſtantial Suſpicions
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62930:46"/>
they had of the ſaid <hi>Prance;</hi> and thereupon there was an Order
got to ſeize him; and he was referred to the Examination of
Sir <hi>Richard Everard,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Harboard.</hi> Now before
the Murder, <hi>Le Pair, Pritchard,</hi> and ſome other Prieſts, had
treated with <hi>bedlow</hi> to be aſſiſting in it; which he at firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to, but after relented and did not come: But the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
after the Fact was committed, which was <hi>Octob.</hi> 14. meeting
with <hi>La Faire,</hi> in <hi>Red-Lyon-Court,</hi> he charged him with being
worſe than his Word, but engaged him to meet him at 9 a
Clock, in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> where he was told by <hi>La Faire,</hi> That
though he was not aſſiſtant as he promiſed in killing Sir <hi>Edmund,</hi>
yet if he would be helpful to carry him off, he ſhould have
2000<hi>l.</hi> Reward. Hereupon <hi>Bedlow</hi> deſiring to ſee the Body,
<hi>Le Faire</hi> ſhewed it him, and then they adviſed together about
the Diſpoſal of it, <hi>Bedlow</hi> being of Opinion, it were beſt to
ſink it in the River with Weights, which was not agreed to.
But in ſeeing the Body, <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſaw <hi>Pranoe</hi> in the Company too,
yet did not know him before.</p>
            <p>This being done, <hi>Bedlow</hi> went to <hi>Briſtol;</hi> but finding himſelf much troubled in Conſcience, having twice taken the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to conceal the Buſineſs, God put it into his Heart, that
ſome Murders being paſt, and to prevent greater to come, he
was convinced it was his Duty to return to <hi>London</hi> to reveal
what he knew; which he did, and went to the Lobby of the
Houſe of Lords in order to it. In the mean time Sir <hi>Charles
Harboard</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Everard</hi> having examined <hi>Prance,</hi> and
the Houſe being ſet, left him to the Care of the Conſtable of
<hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> who brought him to the Lobby of the Lords
Houſe; where <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſeeing him, but never before, ſave the
foreſaid Time in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> he charged the Guards to ſeize
him for that reaſon, ſaying, <hi>He remembred him well, he having,
when they viewed Sir</hi> Edmund'<hi>s Body, a black Perruke on, but now
none.</hi> Hereupon ſearch being made, the Perruke was found.
And hence it was that <hi>Prance</hi> became an Evidence in this
Diſcovery, and on whoſe Evidence chiefly <hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and
<hi>Hill</hi> were convicted and executed. I ſhall not enter into any
more Particulars of this Plot, as being already ſufficiently
treated on by divers Authors, and not falling directly under
under the Courſe of our preſent Deſign; but there is one Thing
very remarkable attending it, and ſuch, I think, as can hardly
be parallel'd in any other Story, and that is, that there ſhould
be ſo many, and ſuch clear Proofs to Murder the King's Perſon,
and yet, that he ſhould be ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ittle apprehenſive of it. But it may
be, as <hi>Tom. Killigrew</hi> was ſaid to have told him, <hi>He knew more
of the Plot than any Body elſe, and his Diſcovery of it, would
quickly have ſatisfied his People.</hi> But whether it were my Lord
Treaſurer <hi>Danby</hi>'s Buſineſs, or the Popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
or the Affairs of the Plot in general, the King having on <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>

            <p>But notwithſtanding this Appearance of ſo mighty a Change in the King, and the Profeſſion of his Readineſs, to give way to any Law that might ſecure the Proteſtant Religion, ſo as the
Succeſſion were not altered; yet the ſame Temper, and ſame
ſort of People ſtill remained at Court, and they were a very
chargeable Crew; wherefore Money was craved at that time,
tho' under pretence, of providing a Fleet for our common Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
now (as Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> ſays,) in time of ſuch a Peace as the
<hi>French</hi> King had granted <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> after King <hi>Charles</hi> had
taken his Money to join in it; and after he had taken the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Money, to enter into an actual War againſt <hi>France,</hi> and
after the Parliament had twice given Money for Disbanding
the ſaid Army; But this the Parliament however did not appear
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62930:47"/>
very forward to give, being mightily troubled with the Prophet
<hi>at the Bleating of that ſort of Cattle,</hi> but more, that they could
not have the ſame Anſwer concerning them, from the King, as
<hi>Saul</hi> made, <hi>That he reſerved them for a Sacrifice, and intended to
deliver them up to pleaſe his People.</hi> The Effects of this Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
was at firſt a Prorogation of both Houſes on the 27th of
<hi>May,</hi> to the 14th of <hi>Aug.</hi> and the Diſſolving of them upon the
12th of <hi>July;</hi> and ſo much the ſooner without doubt, becauſe
they had begun this Seſſions to nibble at a Bill for Excluding the
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> from inheriting the Imperial Crown of <hi>England:</hi>
So that this Parliament proved to be as ſhort-lived, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had been durable, and laſting; but another was called,
to meet the 17th of <hi>Oct.</hi>

ſettled, the Feuds between the Epiſcopal, and Presbyterian
Party increaſing daily, which at laſt, on the 3d of <hi>May</hi> this Year,
brake out into a very barbarous Act, by the Murdering of
Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> by a Party of <hi>Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
who, beſides the ſeverity he uſed towards them, ſince his
exaltation to that Dignity, made himſelf the more obnoxious
to their Rage, becauſe, that having once been a great Zealot
for <hi>Presbyterian-Church-Government;</hi> they eſteemed him now
for no other than a Perjured Apoſtate Prelate, a Villain, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor
of the Godly, and a betrayer of Jeſus Chriſt, and his
Church. This was only a general Accuſation, but ſome of that
Nation have farther confidently affirm'd, That the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſent down a Pardon to ſome Offenders, and the ſame fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into <hi>Sharp</hi>'s Hands, he villanouſly concealed it, till Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
was done upon them; And that the Friends of the deceas'd,
having not been able to procure Satisfaction from him according
to the ordinary Courſe of Law; he by his Intereſt and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
being now about it, were neceſſitated to have Recourſe to
this extraordinary Method. But tho' things did begin here, they
did not end ſo, this Fact proving a Prelude to what followed, for
upon the 29th of the ſame Month, a Party of about 80 of theſe
<hi>Covenanters</hi> met at a place called <hi>Rugland,</hi> well Mounted and
Armed, and when they had firſt Proclaimed the Covenant,
they burnt the following Acts, <hi>viz. The Act concerning the King's
Supremacy, the Receſſory Act,</hi> (whereby all the Laws made during
the King's <hi>Exile</hi> were Repealed,) <hi>the Act for Eſtabliſhing Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
and the Act appointing the Anniverſary of the</hi> 29<hi>th of</hi> May.
On <hi>Sunday, June</hi> the 1ſt. they rendevouz'd about 1500 Men
upon <hi>Snouden-Hill,</hi> their Foot being commanded by one <hi>Wyer,</hi>
and their Horſe by <hi>Robert Hambleton,</hi> one <hi>Parron,</hi> with the
Aſſiſtance of <hi>Balfour</hi> and <hi>Hackſtock,</hi> which two laſt were of the
Number of thoſe that had Aſſaſſinated the Archbiſhop. From
hence they proceeded, and took the City of <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> where
they publiſhed Two Proclamations, which were to this Effect.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:62930:48"/>
WE the Officers of the Covenanted Army,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scotch</hi> Rebels Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</note>, do Require and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

from this Place to our Camp, where-ever we ſhall ſet down the
Same, and to abide with us for that End, during our Pleaſure,
under Pain of being reputed our Enemies, and proceeded againſt
accordingly.</q>
            <p>The other was,</p>
            <q>WE the Officers of the Covenanted Army,<note place="margin">Their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</note> do Require and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

thereof, all Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Curates, their Wives, Bearns,
Servants, and Families, and Perſons concerned in the King's
Army, within 48 Hours after Publiſhing hereof, under highest
Pains.</q>
            <p>And they publiſhed a long Declaration of their taking up Arms, for a free General Aſſembly, and a free Unlimited Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to redreſs the manifold Grievances therein enumerated;
and humbly requeſted his Majeſty to reſtore all Things, as he
found them, when God brought him Home to his Crown and
Kingdoms. In the mean time, the Council at <hi>Edenburg</hi> were
not idle, but raiſed an Army, and quartered it at a Place called
<hi>Black-burn,</hi> to prevent the Covenanters approach to <hi>Edenburg,</hi>
and gave the King an Account of all that paſſed, expecting his
Majeſty's further Orders thereupon. Whereupon the King
diſpatch'd away the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> who,
with wonderful Celerity, having joyned the Army, did on the
22th of <hi>June,</hi> approach towards that of the Covenanters, who
lay in the little Park at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and thereabouts having
choſen very advantageous Ground, there being no Paſſage to
it, but over a Stone-Bridge, called <hi>Bothwel-Bridge,</hi> which they
had barricadced, and well-lined with Muſketeers. They had
no notice of the Duke's March, which was in very good Order,
and in great Silence; but their Guards having at length diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the lighted Matches, they took the Alarm, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
put themſelves in a fighting Poſture. Major <hi>Oglethorp,</hi>
with the Dragoons, had Orders to poſt himſelf near the Bridge,
while the Duke drew up the Army upon the Hill that fronted
<hi>Hamilton-Park</hi> (the River being between him and the Enemy)
about a Mile from the Bridge. The Covenanters were drawn
up in Two diſtinct Bodies, about a Mile aſunder, the ſmalleſt
whereof lay near the Bridge, and the other hard by their
Camp.<note place="margin">They make Propoſals to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
               </note> Being in this Poſture on each ſide, the Duke was no
ſooner come to <hi>Oglethorp</hi>'s Poſt, but there came over to him one
<hi>David Hume,</hi> from the Covenanters, and preſented him with
their Declaration, together with a Petition, ſigned by <hi>Robert
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62930:48"/>
Hamilton,</hi> in the Name of the Covenanted Army, then in
Arms; wherein they prayed, that the Terms of their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
might be made good, and a ſafe Conduct to be granted to
ſome of their Number, to addreſs themſelves to the Duke in
that Matter. To this, the Duke anſwered, <hi>That he would not
treat with them upon their Declaration, but if they would readily
lay down their Arms, he would receive them into the King's Mercy.</hi>
With which Anſwer they went back, deſiring ſome time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
upon it, which the Duke granted: But about half an
Hour after, in return, they ſent a Paper by a Drummer, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting;
<hi>That being informed that his Grace came from</hi> England,
<hi>with Terms to be offered to them, they deſired to know what he had
to propoſe, that they might adviſe, whether the Terms were ſuch as
they could accept of.</hi> Whereupon the Duke finding they trifled,
ſent them Word, <hi>He would receive no more Meſſages from
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While things paſſed thus between the Duke and them,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> fights and routs the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> his Cannon, with ſome Horſe and Foot, were brought down from the Body of the Army, and poſted not far from the Bridge,
which he immediately commanded to play; and which was no
ſooner perceived by the Covenanters, but they threw themſelves
upon the Ground to avoid the Shot: Thoſe of them that were
poſted on the Bridge, fired at firſt very briskly, but after five or
ſix Shot of Cannon, they all ran away, they upon the riſing-Ground
running firſt. The Duke then advanced, and his Men
ſeizing upon the Bridge, threw their Barricadoes of Stones,
Cart-wheels, and the like, into the River, took one Piece of
Cannon, and purſued them up the Hill; but the Covenanters
perceiving their Numbers to be ſmall, they rallied, and faced
about, yet would not venture to come down upon them, tho'
the Duke's Men retired back to the Bridge. In the mean time
the Duke paſſed the Army over the Bridge, and drew them up
on the riſing-Ground, which took up ſome time, and upon whom
the Covenanters advanced in very good Order, before the other
had time enough to do ſo; but upon their approach, eſpying
the Cannon at the Head of the Duke's Army, they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſifted their Order, and opened in the middle, thinking, as
'twas ſuppoſed, they were obliged to ſhoot ſtreight forward;
yet the Cannon being turned upon them, as they then ſtood,
and 3 or 4 times diſcharged, they began to run, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<hi>Robert Hamilton,</hi> being one of the firſt; and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
advancing upon them, it was a perfect Rout, they flying,
and being purſued all Ways, there being between 7 and 800 of
them ſlain, but a far greater Number taken Priſoners. Thus
ended this extravagant Undertaking of the <hi>Scots,</hi> which ſerved
only to make their Chains the heavier, as doubtleſs the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to ſuppreſs them, was intended for
no good to him neither, his Court-Enemies thinking thereby
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62930:49"/>
to render him odious to the Presbyterians, and other Diſſenters
in <hi>England,</hi> but there their Politicks failed them; for the Fears
of Popery, and a Popiſh Succeſſor at this time, had very deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
poſſeſſed Men's Minds, and the Duke's Perſon, after the
King's, was the only viſible One they had to rely upon to ſtave
off the dreadful Monſter;<note place="margin">The Story of the black Box.</note> and of this, the Popiſh Faction were
mighty jealous, and ſo much the rather, becauſe there was a
Pamphlet printed and handed about, that the King had been
married to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Mother, and rumour'd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
That Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrard</hi> had a black Box, wherein the
ſaid Marriage was fully proved, and made out; And indeed
the Fears of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s ſucceeding to the Crown, were
ſuch, that the People were willing to lay hold on any Twig, and
ſo to be very eaſie of Belief in the Particulars of this Story;
But he the Matter as it will, the Tories and Popiſh Party had
ſuch an Influence at Court, that the King began now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
Heart and Soul theirs, and ſo made Three Declarations;
the firſt in the Preſence of <hi>W. Cant. H. Finch, C. H. Coventry,</hi>
and <hi>J. Williamſon,</hi> the 6th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1679. wherein he declared,
That they who ſhould ſay he was married, or contracted to the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Mother, were neither his, nor the Duke's
Friends; and declared in the Preſence of Almighty God, That
he never was married, nor contracted to any other Woman
whatſoever, but his Wife Queen <hi>Catharine.</hi> Upon the 3d of
<hi>March</hi> following, he cauſed this Declaration to be entred into
the Council-Book, being all written, and ſign'd with his own
Hand, in a Paper he delivered in at the Board, to be kept in
the Council-Cheſt, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>And becauſe they might make ſure Work of it, the ſame Thing was again repeated on the 2d of <hi>June,</hi> 1680. with Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverations to the ſame Purpoſe, wherein he called the Report
of his Marriage, or Contract with Mrs. <hi>Walters,</hi> alias <hi>Barlow,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Mother, falſe and ſcandalous; and
charged all his Subjects not to preſume to utter or publiſh any
ſuch Thing, and all thoſe were publiſhed together by his ſpecial
Order, which, tho' diſtant in Time, I thought fit to mention
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62930:49"/>
together,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1680</label> to avoid an interrupted Diſcourſe, as much as poſſibly
I was able. And that the King might further gratifie that
Faction, as well as he had done the Nation, in ſending the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> out of it, he ſent the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> away
alſo.<note place="margin">K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. ſick, and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it.</note> The King, towards the latter end of <hi>Aug.</hi> fell ill at
<hi>Windſor,</hi> and his Indiſpoſition in a little time proved to be an
Ague: I will not deny, but <hi>Monmouth</hi> did, at that time, double
the Guards, and ſhew more Activity than ordinary, in the
Management of Things; and for my part, I do think, if the
King had gone off ſuddenly, the Duke would have bid very
fair for the Crown. However, the King was in no Danger,
tho' his Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> apprehended himſelf to be
ſo in that Conjuncture; and therefore he had no ſooner Notice
of the King's Illneſs, which was early enough, but he poſted to
Court with all Expedition; and on the 2d of <hi>Dec.</hi> arrived at
<hi>Windſor;</hi> the Conſequence whereof, was the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s
Baniſhment, who thereupon retired to <hi>Vtretch,</hi> as his
Unkle the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> did in a little time back again to <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;</hi>
but this laſt, without any Deſign to ſtay: For on the
12th of <hi>Oct.</hi> he, with his whole Family, arrived at St. <hi>James</hi>'s,
to the Surprize of moſt People. The other, was reſolved not
to be long behind him; for being informed, that Baniſhment
is a Puniſhment, which the King cannot inflict upon any Man,
unleſs he be convicted of ſome ill Crime; he returned alſo on
the 27th of <hi>Nov.</hi> at Night to <hi>London,</hi> at which, the Citizens
expreſs'd a mighty Joy by Bonefires and Ringing of Bells all the
next Day,<note place="margin">Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</note> and moſt part of the Night that followed. But by
how much the more Affectionate the Citizens and Nation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be towards him, the King and his Court proved to
be ſo much the leſs ſo; For all his Places of Profit and Truſt,
were immediately taken from him: Whereas the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
was ſent High Commiſſioner into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Victory at <hi>Blackbourn,</hi> had left a clear Field for the
other to play his Game. But this did not well agree with the
King's Speech at the Opening of the laſt Parliament; When
he ſaid, <hi>That he had commanded his Brother to abſent himſelf from
him, becauſe he would not leave malicious Men room to ſay, that
he had not removed all Cauſes which could be pretended to influence
him to Popiſh Councils,</hi> and a little Time will ſhew it.</p>
            <p>You have heard before, that the King by Proclamation, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Parliament upon the 12th of <hi>July,</hi> and iſſued out Writs for the Meeting of another on the 17th of <hi>Oct.</hi> following;
But, like the uſual Methods of many other Things in this
Reign, when they met, they were prorogued to the 26th of
<hi>Jan.</hi> and from thence to the 5th of <hi>Ap.</hi> 1680. and further, from
thence to the 21ſt of <hi>Oct.</hi> when he graciouſly declared, they
ſhould Sit and do Buſineſs. Theſe were ſtrange doings, and
therefore the more ſober Part of the Nation, and ſuch as had a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62930:50"/>
due Regard to the publick Good, beſtirred themſelves in the
Interval of the firſt Prorogation, to move the King, in the
moſt dutiful Manner, for the Sitting of the Parliament; and
that you may have a true Idea of the Matter, we will give you
an Inſtance or two of the Entertainment they met with at
Court upon this Occaſion. There came ſeveral Petitions, to
this end, from divers Counties and Corporations, and, among
the reſt, one from <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> was, on the 22th of <hi>Jan.</hi> preſented
to the King by <hi>Thomas Thynne,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> accompanied by Sir <hi>Walter
St. Johns,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford.</hi> He asked them, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had Directions from the Grand Jury for what they did?</hi>
And Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> having anſwered,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Charles</hi> II's different Carriage to the Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</note> 
               <hi>No;</hi> the King replied, <hi>Why
ſay you then that you come from the Country? You came from a
Company of looſe, diſaffected People; What do they take me to be?
And what do you take your ſelves to be? I admire Gentlemen of
your Eſtates ſhould animate People to Mutiny and Rebellion; you
would not take it well, I ſhould meddle with your Affairs; and I
deſire you will not meddle with mine, eſpecially with a Matter that
is ſo eſſential a Part of my Prerogative.</hi> Another Petition of the
like Nature, being preſented to him the Day following, by
Sir <hi>Gabriel Barrington,</hi> Coll. <hi>Mildmay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Honywood,</hi> &amp;c. in
the Names of themſelves, and others the Inhabitants of the
County of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> the Anſwer was, <hi>That he was extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
to ſee them meddle with Matters that ſo immediately concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Crown and him, and that againſt the Senſe of the best and
chiefeſt Men in the County; that he believed that ſome of thoſe that
had Signed the Petition, might mean well, but that they were abuſed
by thoſe that did not.</hi> To which he was pleaſed to add (in my Mind,
a very ſtrange Paſſage) <hi>That he was not willing to call to mind
Things paſt, yet, that he could not but remember the Act of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
tho' not as ſome did; That thoſe who had ſtood in need of that
Act, would do well not to take ſuch Courſes, as might need another;
and that he very well remembred</hi> 40; and ſo turned away. And
for the <hi>Berkſhire</hi> Gentlemen, and their Petition, which was
preſented the ſame Day, from their Quarter-Seſſions, he was
pleaſed to droll it out, ſaying, <hi>That they would agree that Matter
over a Cup of Ale, when they met at</hi> Windſor; <hi>tho' he wondered,
that his Neighbours would meddle with his Buſineſs.</hi> Farther, that
the Nation, as well as theſe reſpective Gentlemen, might not
be ignorant of the Court-Sentiments in theſe Matters, theſe
Anſwers were publickly inſerted in the <hi>Gazzettes,</hi> but without
the Petitions, as if they would have it ſuggeſted ſlily to the
World, that there were ſome audacious and very criminal
Things contained in them. Whereas, the Abhorrers of Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning,
and conſequently of Parliaments, and of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Conſtitution of our Government, had the Honour of
having their Addreſſes put in ample Manner into the Publick
Prints, (which, in theſe Times, were ſtuffed with nothing elſe)
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62930:50"/>
many of them to be Dubbed Knights, and a good Soak of
Wine in the King's Cellar to boot, by particular Order; which
I know to be true on my own Knowledge. The King being
found to be of this Humour, and there happening to be ſo long
an Interval of Parliament, by the ſeveral Prorogations that
were made, and the Duke doing what he pleaſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
there could be no very earneſt Proſecution of the Popiſh Plot,
you may well imagine; nay, it was ſo far ridiculed in this
Time, by <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> and others, Penſioners of the Tory Party,
that indifferent Men began to doubt, whether there were any
ſuch Thing or no, while the Popiſh Faction began to trump up
a new Plot upon the Whigs or Diſſenters; But their Deſigns
being not laid cloſe enough, though the Devil was at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom

Sitting of the Parliament, and ſee what they are doing all this

            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> finding himſelf weak at Home,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> ſent Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador into <hi>Holland,</hi> and for what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> tho' I muſt ſpeak my Conſcience, I know of no one ſo great an Inſtrument of it as himſelf, it was high time to make ſome Alliances Abroad;
and the rather, ſince <hi>France</hi> by the late Peace was grown ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Powerful, and in the Main, had no great Reaſon to be
ſatisfied with his Conduct, whatever good Meen they were
pleaſed from time to time to put upon it; he ſent Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi>
into <hi>Holland</hi> towards the latter end of the laſt Year, to propoſe
to the <hi>States</hi> the making a Treaty of Guarranty for the Peace
concluded at <hi>Nimeguen. France</hi> did then moſt induſtriouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that Alliance, but yet in a covert Manner at firſt, by a
Stratagem as odd as it might ſeem to ſome Extravagant; There
being a Letter conveyed to the <hi>States-General</hi> from an unknown
Hand, wherein was repreſented at large, the ill Poſture thoſe
Provinces were fallen to, which was the Reaſon the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Princes had not the ſame Regard for their Republick,
as formerly; witneſs the Menaces of <hi>Spain, Denmark, Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
&amp;c. and that the only way to reſtore the <hi>States</hi> into the
Condition it was in formerly, was, to enter into a ſtrict Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with <hi>France,</hi> in purſuance of which, the <hi>French</hi> King
would maintain 50000 Men in Arms, and the States need not
keep above 10000 Foot, and 6000 Horſe and Dragoons in their
Pay; That by that means thoſe Provinces would be able to
defend themſelves againſt any whomſoever that ſhould attack
them; That that Alliance ſhould be confirmed every Year by
mutual Oaths by the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> one at <hi>Paris;</hi> And this being effected, the Subjects of
their Republick ſhould have alone the Trade in that King's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
to the Excluſion of all other Nations. This was
ſoon after ſeconded with a Memorial by the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador,
concerning an Alliance the King his Maſter offered to enter
into with the States, to be founded upon the Foot of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62930:51"/>
made, <hi>An.</hi> 1662. which Offers were further enforced, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
unto them, as well the Advantage that would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue
to them upon their accepting, as the Inconveniencies
that might follow upon their refuſal of it; and telling them,
that any Delay in the Affair would be looked upon as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal,
and that his Maſter would regulate himſelf according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But the States taking ſome time to deliberate, and demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
upon the Matter, they received Letters in the mean while
from their Embaſſadors at <hi>Paris,</hi> importing, That being ſent
for by Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> and going to him, he had put them
in mind of the many Obligations the States had to the King
his Maſter, and of the particular Demonſtration he had given
them of his Affection, in offering them a Peace in the midſt of
his Conqueſts, upon the Terms he did; That he had ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Overtures from them of a nearer Alliance; But they
having been wanting, he had himſelf for ſome time ſince, made
an Offer of the ſame by his Embaſſadors at the <hi>Hague;</hi> That
it had been debated in the Aſſembly of the States of <hi>Holland;</hi>
and that the ſaid States had Adjourned themſelves, without
coming to any Reſolution therein; That the King was much
ſurprized to find them make ſo ſmall an Account of an Alliance
which they themſelves had ſought for ſome Years before by an
Extraordinary Embaſſadors, now the ſame was offered them;
That this Alliance propoſed, was only Defenſive, which the
States could receive no Prejudice by, but much Advantage;
That his Majeſty underſtood that the King of <hi>England</hi> did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them, while he pretended to make himſelf an Alliance
with them; and that his Majeſty would have great Cauſe to be
diſſatisfied with the States, if they ſhould refuſe the Overtures
made by him, and inſtead thereof, cloſe with thoſe of the King
of <hi>England;</hi> concluding, That his Majeſty (as his Embaſſador
the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> had already told them) would take their
Delay for a Refuſal; That, however, he would keep the
Peace with them, but would at the ſame time look upon them
as a State that did not deſerve to live in good Amity with him,
and would not favour their Commerce.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> the King's Embaſſadors in <hi>Holland,</hi> (as I told you) and now Earl of <hi>Rumney,</hi> was no ſooner informed of the foreſaid Memorial and Proceedings of <hi>France,</hi> but he put
in a like Memorial to the States, ſhewing, That the King his
Maſter, having underſtood the Propoſals that had been made
them by the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors, could not believe that the
States could ſo far forget their own, and common Intereſts of
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as to accept of them; That his Majeſty particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
would have Cauſe, after their having refuſed the Act of
Guarranty which he lately offered to enter into with them, for
ſecuring their preſent Peace, to reſent their entring into any
new Engagements with <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially ſince his Majeſty might
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62930:51"/>
have juſt Cauſe to be jealous, that the ſame could have no other
end, than to enable the <hi>French</hi> King to ſhew his Reſentments
of the Peace his Majeſty had made with the States in 1674, and
of what his Majeſty did afterward, in order to the procuring a
more advantageous Peace for them and their Allies, than that
which was made at <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> That ſuch a Reſolution in the
States, would certainly prejudice that ſtrict Union and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
that was eſtabliſhed between him and them, and oblige his
Majeſty to take other Meaſures; But that his Majeſty, for his
part, would not only punctually comply with what was ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and agreed in the Defenſive Treaty made between <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> the 3d of <hi>Mar.</hi> 1678, if they would reject the <hi>French</hi>
Alliance, but alſo ſtand by them to the uttermoſt, if they ſhould
be attack'd by <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Addreſs and Diligence in the Proſecution of this Matter was admirable, and ſucceeded ſo well, that the States determined civilly to refuſe the Alliance propoſed by <hi>France.</hi>
But the <hi>French</hi> King having declared, he was not ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
his ſaid Embaſſador made another Effort to divert the
States from their intended Reſolution, ſhewing, That he had
received further Orders from the King his Maſter, to acquaint
them, That his Majeſty was extreamly aſtoniſhed at their
manner of Proceedings in the Matter of the Alliance by him
propoſed, and highly reſented it; That he was commanded to
expect ſome Days longer their final Reſolution in that Affair;
but that afterward he ſhould ſay no more of it, nor accept any
Act which they ſhould offer; and that then they muſt expect
his Maſter would take ſuch Meaſures as he thought neceſſary
for the Good of his Kingdoms, and the Advantage of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in their Commerce; That Monſ. <hi>Colbert</hi> had told their
Embaſſadors at <hi>Paris,</hi> The King his Maſter wonder'd extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to find all Perſons in <hi>Holland</hi> full of Hopes, (which their
Letters had given them) That his Majeſty would not depart
from the Execution of the Peace; and that if they would not
enter into that Alliance with him, they ſhould only ſuffer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in their Commerce; That the Senſe of what he had then
told them from the King his Maſter, had been wrong delivered
by them, and worſe interpreted at the <hi>Hague;</hi> That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
did not threaten them with his Indignation, but the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction
which he had conceived at their Proceedings, might
perhaps be the Occaſion of greater Prejudice to them, than
the Indignation of others; and that they would do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what had happened to them within 8 or 10 Years paſt,
the Beginnings whereof had been leſs conſiderable, than the
juſt Diſſatisfaction which their preſent Conduct gave the King
his Maſter. <hi>D' Avaux</hi> had no ſooner ended, but Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi>
was ready to oppoſe; who, after he had take notice to the
States of the great Earneſtneſs of the <hi>French,</hi> to preſs them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62930:52"/>
their Alliance, he thought fit to repeat his Inſtances to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
them from it; That the King his Maſter did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make uſe of Threats, of which the Memorials of the
<hi>French</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mbaſſador were full, but would leave them wholly to
be guided by the Conſideration of their own Intereſts; That
his Majeſty did perſwade himſelf, that after the Aſſurances of
Aſſiſtance he had given them, in whatever might happen, they
would not enter into any Engagements, which his Majeſty
ſhould have Cauſe to look upon as intended againſt him; and
that the Inſtances of the <hi>French</hi> King, which were too ſharp
and preſſing for a Free Republick, would not divert them from
their true Intereſts, and from that ſtrict Friendſhip that was
between his Majeſty and their State, and of which his Majeſty
had given them ſuch eſſential Proofs.<note place="margin">K. <hi>Charles</hi> makes a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </note> This was no ſooner done,
but the States of <hi>Holland</hi> came to an unanimous Reſolution, not
to accept of the Alliance which was propoſed them by <hi>France,</hi>
and their Example ſoon after, was followed by thoſe of <hi>Guelder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Vtretch, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Over-Iſſel,</hi> &amp;c. But thoſe of <hi>Gron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningen</hi>
and <hi>Ommelands</hi> were of another Opinion. Though
this proved of no Advantage to <hi>France;</hi> for notwithſtanding
the Difference of thoſe Provinces from the reſt, as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
uſed to do in moſt other Caſes, yet it ſignified next to
nothing, ſince in Matters of a Negative, Plurality of Voices
carried it: And <hi>France</hi> finding Things would not drive as
they deſigned it, wiſely let the ſame drop, and took no further
notice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> had no ſooner got out of the War, by which they had been ſo much Gainers, but they began to think of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Method,<note place="margin">The Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to marry.</note> for the preſent, of enlarging their Dominions;
and that was, by marrying the Dauphine to ſome Princeſs or
other, that might afford them ſome Pretenſions, and at laſt,
pitched upon the young Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Siſter, to which
Court, Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> was diſpatch'd, and who, upon his
Arrival, made the following Propoſals.</p>
            <p>I. That his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, out of the great Reſpect and good Will he had to his Electoral Highneſs, made him an Offer of a Princeſs of his own Blood in Marriage.</p>
            <p>II. That for a greater Teſtimony of that his good Will, and to advance the Elector's Glory, in caſe he had Thoughts of becoming Emperor, and, in order thereunto, to be choſen King
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> his Majeſty would not only aſſiſt him with his
good Offices, but with his Services alſo, to compaſs that Deſign.
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In order to make the Union the more cloſe between him and the Elector, he deſired his Siſter in Marriage for the <hi>Dauphine</hi> his Son.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62930:52"/>
To theſe the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Miniſters, after ſome Deliberation,
made the following Anſwer: That as to their Elector, and the
Lady offered him, they were yet too young to ſpeak of their
Marriage; That the Elector was very well contented with the
Eſtates and Honours he poſſeſſed, and had no Deſign of increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them; But as to the reſt, they were ready to enter into a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
concerning a Treaty of Marriage between the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi>
and their Princeſs. Which Reſolutions, tho' they were not
very pleaſing to the <hi>French</hi> Court, yet the Treaty went on, and
was at laſt concluded, and the Marriage firmly conſummated,
though it met with a conſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rable Obſtruction from an Article
which they would have ſtipulated therein; That in caſe of the
Failure of an Heir Male of the Line of <hi>William,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi>
the Succeſſion of the Dukedom ſhould devolve to the
Son of the <hi>Dauphine,</hi> by the Princeſs now to be married to him,
if he had any. But this the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Miniſters would by no

but that ſhe muſt make an entire Renunciation of the ſame

no viſible Advantage to <hi>France</hi> from this Match at preſent, or,
indeed, in the Conſequence of it, but that ſhe proved the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of 3 Princes, and then left the <hi>Dauphine</hi> a Widdower, to
better his Country by ſome new Alliance, towards which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

Talk of the World has been in that particular.</p>
            <p>I have been ſo particular in inſerting moſt of the material Articles of the Peace, concluded between all the contending Parties at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> that I ſhall always refer the Reader to
them in the Series of this Diſcourſe, in all Things he meets with
relating to any of them by way of Infringement, or otherwiſe,
without any further Recapitulation. And firſt you ſhall hear
how far the Emperor and Empire have thought themſelves ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved,

(and this was but in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1680. <hi>N. S.</hi>) contravened the Peace
in ſeveral Particulars: As, 1. By continuing their Troops in

to evacuate. 3. By requiring Contributions. 4. By obliging
the 10 Towns of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> to take a new Oath, thereby pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Sovereignty over them, erecting a new Court of Appeals,
and forbidding any Addreſs to be made to the Imperial Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

Nobles of <hi>Alſace.</hi> 6. By ſetting up Pretenſions upon the Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalage

came at laſt to the following Reſolution,<note place="margin">The Reſult of the Diet.</note> That theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the <hi>French</hi> were directly contrary to the Treaties
of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> and that therefore the Emperor
ſhould be intreated, by Letter or by Embaſſie, in the Name of
himſelf and the Empire, to demand of the moſt Chriſtian King
Reparation for the ſame; and that, in the mean time, the
<hi>French</hi> Miniſters reſiding at the Imperial Court, and at <hi>Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi>
ſhould be made acquainted with the Reſolution of the
Diet; And that it ſhould be repreſented unto them for what
concerned the two firſt Points, that they were directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the 27th Article of the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and the 1ſt,
2d, and 4th Articles of the Inſtrument afterwards Signed by the
Embaſſadors for the executing of the ſaid Treaty, which had
been religiouſly obſerved by the Emperor; That the 3d Point
was contrary to the 30th Article of the ſaid Treaty, and the
8th Article of the ſaid Inſtrument. That for what concerned
the 4th Point, it was known, that the 3d Article of the Treaty
of <hi>Munſter,</hi> ſays, That the County of the <hi>Vpper</hi> and <hi>Lower Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſace,</hi>
and the Lordſhip of <hi>Haguenau,</hi> ſhould be yielded to
<hi>France,</hi> with an expreſs Exception of the 10 Imperial Towns,
their Rights and Priviledges, and that the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould
pretend to no Superiority over them; and that, in purſuance
of the Agreement made at <hi>Nuremburg,</hi> in 1650, <hi>Haguenaw,
Landaw,</hi> and other of the ſaid 10 Towns, were actually eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated
by the <hi>French,</hi> without pretending then, and ſeveral
Years afterwards, to any Sovereignty over the ſaid Towns, or
requiring any Oath of Fidelity from them: That afterward,
in 1665, Complaints were made to that Diet, of the <hi>French</hi>
ſetting up new Pretenſions; whereupon Arbitrators had been
choſen, both on the part of the Emperor and of <hi>France,</hi> ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably
to determine the ſame, who had been ſeveral Years em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the ſaid Work, and which was put an end to by the
<hi>French</hi> poſſeſſing themſelves of the ſaid Towns, even before
the War; That the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen</hi> did confirm that of
<hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and conſequently, that the ſaid Towns ought to be
reſtored to the Enjoyment of the Rights and Priviledges,
which they ſtipulated for them: That for the 5th and 6th
Points, they likewiſe directly contravened the ſaid Treaties:
That, as for the 7th, they expected further Information on it:
As for the 8th, they could not imagine what Right the <hi>French</hi>
had to fortifie <hi>Schleſtadt,</hi> conſidering the Promiſes with relation
to thoſe Free Towns: For the 9th and 10th, That the <hi>French</hi>
had acted notoriouſly contrary to the <hi>Weſtphalian</hi> and <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen</hi>
Treaties: For the 11th, That <hi>Homburg,</hi> belonged to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62930:53"/>
Count of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> as appeared by the Treaty of <hi>Oſnalbrug:</hi> That
as for what concerned <hi>Bitſoh,</hi> they expected further Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They hoped the <hi>French</hi> King would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<hi>Strasburg</hi> in its Rights and Priviledges, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that of fortifying <hi>Kiel,</hi> that was ſo neceſſary for its Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>But for all theſe Remonſtrances, the <hi>French</hi> were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<hi>Metz, Toul</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> with other Lands and Places, ſhould
be reſtored to the Empire, and the City of <hi>Friburg</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror:
That 60000 Men ſhould be maintained in <hi>Hungary,</hi> to
be employed againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> without any Charge to the
Empire, which ſhould only maintain a Body of 16000 Men;
That all the Places which ſhould be taken in <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſhould
be put into the Emperor's Hands; That a conſiderable Fleet
ſhould be employed againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> towards the <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello</hi>'s;
That Two Univerſities ſhould be erected in <hi>Germany,</hi>
for the Uſe of the ſeveral Religions there; And Laſtly, That

            <p>But what Effect ſoever theſe Propoſals were like to have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Empire in general, the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> felt the Effects of the <hi>French</hi> Arms about this time in particular; for they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked

great many more put together, made the Emperor and Empire
put forth their Complaints in every Court, where there was
any hopes of Relief: And particularly, the Emperor's Miniſter
in <hi>Holland</hi> repreſented to the States-General; That, by Order
of His Imperial Majeſty, he was to acquaint them, that the
Officers of the moſt Chriſtian King had already ſeized a great
part of the Territories of the Elector <hi>Palatine;</hi> and it was to
be feared they would do the like by the reſt of his Countries,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62930:54"/>
on Pretence of Dependances, and other Rights, which they
took upon them to ſearch Antiquity for, even to the Time of
King <hi>Dagoberte</hi> That the Elector of <hi>Trier</hi> had already ſuffered
the like Treatment: And that other Princes of the Empire
were expoſed to the ſame Dangers; and particularly the City
of <hi>Strasburg;</hi> which being directly contrary to the Peace of
<hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the Preſervation whereof was not only neceſſary to
the Tranquility of <hi>Germany,</hi> but likewiſe to the Good of that
Republick, whoſe Intereſt was no leſs to have a good Barrier
towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> than towards <hi>Flanders;</hi> He therefore deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the ſaid States would effectually employ their good Offices
at the <hi>French</hi> Court, to the end thoſe Contraventions might

them meddle with the Succeſſion of the Crown in the Right Line,
but proceed in the Diſcovery of the Plot, and to the Trial of the
Lords.</hi> As for the Alliance with <hi>Holland,</hi> I have already given
you an Account of it; and, indeed, it was well managed, as well
as a good Point gained, and deſerved more Notice ſhould have
been taken of it by the Parliament; and, perhaps, they would
have done it another time: But, as for the other with <hi>Spain,</hi> I
can give you no Particulars of it; And for <hi>Tangier,</hi> there had
been ſeveral Attacks made upon it this Year, and for ſome time
paſt, and was chargeable enough to the King; But, of this
we ſhall have Occaſion to ſay ſomething hereafter. And, as for
the King's Sincerity in recommending to them the Proſecution
of the Plot; That Man that conſiders the Tranſactions between
the Prorogation of the laſt Parliament, and the Sitting of this,
with the Methods that were uſed to ſtifle the real Plot, and to
father a Sham one upon innocent Men, and yet believes the
King to be in Earneſt, has a large Faith, and much Good may
do him with it. Then for his profeſſing his Readineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
with any new Remedies that ſhould be propoſed, that were
conſiſtent with preſerving the Succeſſion of the Crown in its
due and legal Courſe of Deſcent, it implied no more than <hi>Let
the Wolf be Shepherd, and let the Sheep make what Laws they pleaſe
for their Preſervation.</hi> For it was well known, the Duke was a
Papiſt, whoſe Maxims are to keep no Faith with Hereticks.
However, the Houſe of Commons entred into Debates about
this Matter, and there were many Expedients propoſed, how
the Eſtabliſhed Government in Church and State could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
yet none could be found practicable, in caſe the Duke
ſucceeded: So that the Country Party moved, that the Court
Party ſhould propound their Expedients in the Caſe; but they
either could not, or elſe had no Inſtructions from the Court to
warrant ſuch Expedients, as might be propoſed by them. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being thus at a ſtand, in reſpect to the Securing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, the Houſe of Commons at laſt could think of
no other Way to effect it, than by bringing in a Bill for the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Excluſion of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from the Crown; which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſeveral Debates upon it, they paſſed on the 11th of <hi>Nov.</hi>
And of which, that you may the better comprehend the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

But the Lords Rancounter to the Commons in this Bill
(tho' they made a Sift upon the others Impeachment, to Try
and Sentence <hi>William,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Bill thrown out of the Houſe of Lords.</note> Lord Viſcount <hi>Stafford</hi> to Death, for

Upper-Houſe, the Queſtion being put, Whether it ſhould be
read the Second time, it was reſolved in the Negative by above
a double Majority of Votes, and ſo this great Affair dropp'd.
The Commons imployed much of their Time to proſecute and
impeach all thoſe that had countenanced the Popiſh Plot,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrers of Petitioning.</note> or
were Abhorrers of Petitioning the King for the Meeting of
the Parliament, in the ſeveral Prorogations of it, and voted,
That it ever had been the undoubted Right of the Subjects of
<hi>England,</hi> to Petition the King for the Calling and Sitting of
Parliaments, and Redreſs of Grievances. And that to traduce
ſuch Petitioning as a Violation of Duty, and to repreſent the
ſame to his Majeſty, as Tumultuous and Seditious, was to betray
the Liberty of the Subject, and contributed to the Deſigns of
ſubverting the ancient Legal Conſtitutions of the Kingdom of
<hi>England,</hi> and introducing Arbitrary Power. The firſt that fell
under their Laſh, was Sir <hi>Francis Withens</hi> (ſince a Judge) a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
then of their own Houſe, whom they voted to be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer
of the undoubted Rights of the Subjects of <hi>England;</hi>
and for that his high Crime, expelled him the Houſe, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt the Sentence at the Bar, upon his Marrow-bones.
Sir <hi>George Jefferys</hi> was the next, then Recorder of <hi>London;</hi>
who for the preſent, by Virtue of the Houſe's Addreſs to the
King, for that End, was put out of all publick Offices; tho' we
have ſeen him ſince act the Tyrant in the higheſt Station, the
late King, his good Maſter, could advance him to, but at laſt
being left in the Lurch by him, was found in a Seaman's Habit
at <hi>Wapping,</hi> and died in the <hi>Tower,</hi> becauſe he had not Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
enough to live a little longer to be hang'd. Several
others were cenſured upon the like Account; and, among the
reſt, the Houſe voted, That it was a ſufficient Ground for
them to proceed againſt Sir <hi>Thomas Jones,</hi> one of the Judges of
the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Weſtone,</hi> a Baron of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi>
for high Crimes and Miſdemeanors, becauſe they had
adviſed, and were aſſiſting to draw up a Proclamation againſt
Petitioning for the Sitting of the Parliament. The like was
paſſed againſt Sir <hi>Francis North,</hi> Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi>
for the ſame; who, for murdering poor <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi>
under Colour of Law, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> had the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>
committed to his Cuſtody, and therewith the Care of the King's
Conſcience, who had none at all of his own.</p>
            <p>All this while we hear nothing of the King's Buſineſs, which was, to get Money for the Preſervation of <hi>Tangier,</hi> and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Alliance made with <hi>Spain;</hi> But the Commons had
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62930:56"/>
Three Reaſons why they would not comply with his Majeſty in
his firſt Demand: One was, for that the State of the Nation
was ſuch at that time, that their giving any Money for that End,
might augment the Strength of the Popiſh Party, and further
endanger the Nation's Safety. Another was, Seeing there were
ſeveral Regiments, beſides Guards in <hi>England</hi> then in Pay, they
might be tranſported to <hi>Tangier</hi> with little Charge, and be
maintain'd there as cheap as at Home; which Two Reaſons
they clench'd with this Third, That that Garriſon was the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
of Popiſh Officers and Soldiers. And if Things went ill
with the King on this Head, he is like to fare no better with
the other. For the Houſe had as many Reaſons for not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him Money for the Alliance of Mutual Obligations of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and Defence, which he pretended to have made with
<hi>Spain;</hi> For firſt, they ſeemed to be jealous of the King's Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
therein; and the more, becauſe he had not declared to
them what manner of Alliance that was, and that it might be
more to the Prejudice than Benefit of the Kingdom; or if it
ſhould have been to the Advantage of it, they could have no
more Aſſurance of the Performance, than they had of the Triple
League; That which was made with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> when
he was in <hi>England;</hi> Or that between the King and States of
<hi>Holland,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Hyde,</hi> on the King's Part, which were all bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
almoſt as ſoon as made. Beſides, it was impoſſible any
great Benefit ſhould ariſe to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> by ſuch an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance;
For if all Chriſtendom, after the ſeparate Peace made
by the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> could not uphold <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Netherlands,</hi> from falling under the Dominion of <hi>France,</hi>
how could the King, in the feeble and diſtracted State of the
Nation, be in a Condition to ſupport it without them? Add
to this, the Unreaſonableneſs of giving Money upon ſuch an
Account; For, tho' the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Supplies for maintaining vaſt Wars, yet never any
one of them before, demanded Supplies for making Alliances.
And, indeed, whatever Alliance the King had made with <hi>Spain,</hi>
it will be found before his Reign has ſpun out, that it was very
ill performed on his part. And if the Commons were not a
little mortified at the Proceedings of the Lords, and of the
Court, in reſpect to the Bill of Excluſion, the King could not
be well pleaſed (to be ſure) with the Methods they took to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
his Demands of a preſent Supply, in the ordinary way;
but was undoubtedly much more nettled at their Reſolutions
to hinder him from being relieved by extraordinary Methods
afterwards: For, the Houſe conſidering the weak and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Condition of the Nation, as well by the Debt the King
had contracted by ſhutting up of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> as by his
ſquandering away almoſt all the ancient Revenues of the
Crown, did, in order to prevent the like upon the Revenue
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62930:57"/>
ſettled upon the King ſince his Reſtoration, on the 17th of
<hi>Jan.</hi> reſolve,</p>
            <p>1. That whoſoever ſhould lend,<note place="margin">The Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commons againſt lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King Money.</note> or cauſe to be lent by way of Advance, any Money upon the Branches of the King's Revenue ariſing by Cuſtom, Exciſe, or Hearth-money, ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
an Hinderer of the Sitting of Parlaiment, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible
for the ſame.</p>
            <p>2. That whoſoever ſhould buy any Tally, or Anticipation upon any part of the King's Revenue, or whoſoever ſhould pay ſuch Tally hereafter to be ſtruck, ſhould be adjudged to
hinder the Sittings of Parliaments, and be reſponſible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Things being brought to this deſperate paſs between them, without any viſible Hopes of a better Underſtanding, the Thoughts of the Court now began to think of a Prorogation
or Diſſolution; and the Commons were, it ſeems, aware of it;
For on <hi>Monday, Jan.</hi> the 10th, before the Uſher of the Black-Rod
came into the Houſe, to command their Attendance on
the King in the Houſe of Lords, they had reſolved, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
adviſed the King to prorogue this Parliament, to any
Purpoſe than in order to the Paſſing of a Bill for the Excluſion
of <hi>James,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was a Betrayer of the King, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant

of the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and a Penſioner to <hi>France;</hi> Which was
no ſooner done, but they were Prorogued to the 20th of <hi>Jan.</hi>
and upon the 18th he Diſſolved them; And ſo ended this Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Parliament, with which, having run out a few Days into
the new Year, we conclude the Year 1680, only we ſhall note
firſt two or three Particulars.</p>

<hi>Henry</hi> the III's Time; and at <hi>Coventry</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the VI's Time;
with divers others, which have proved fatal to thoſe Kings, and
have been followed with great Miſchief on the whole Kingdom:
And conſidering the preſent Poſture of Affairs, the many Jealouſies
and Diſcontents that are among the People, they have great Cauſe

Prorogued on the 10th of this Month, before any ſufficient
Order could be taken therein, all their juſt and pious Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to ſave the Nation, were overthrown, the good Bills
they had been induſtriouſly preparing, to unite all Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Proteſtant Subjects brought to nought, the Diſcovery
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot ſtifled, the Witneſſes that came in frequently,
more fully to declare that both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged;
thoſe Foreign Kingdoms and States, who by a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Conjunction with us, might give a Check to the <hi>French</hi>
Power, diſheartned even to ſuch a Deſpair of their own Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
againſt the growing Greatneſs of that Monarch, as we

Deſolation.</p>
                        <p>In theſe Extremities we had nothing under God, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us, but the Hopes that Your Majeſty (being touched with the Groans of Your periſhing People) would have ſuffered
Your Parliament to have met at the Day unto which it was
Prorogued, and that no further Interruption ſhould have been
given to their Proceedings, in order to the ſaving of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Lords nor Commons can be in Safety, but will be daily expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Sword of the Papiſts and their Adherents, of whom
too many are crept into Your Majeſty's Guards, the Liberty
of ſpeaking according to their Conſciences will be thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and the Validity of all their Acts and Proceedings

ſuch, that happening to come acquainted with one <hi>Everard</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

he did about the Beginning of <hi>Feb.</hi> after the Parliament was

upon the 21ſt of <hi>Feb.</hi> gave him ſome Heads by Word
of Mouth to draw up ſuch a Pamphlet: Which Procedure of
his made <hi>Everard</hi> acquaint ſeveral withal, and particularly one
Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> whom he engaged, in a

the former came, where he heard <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> give <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi>
Inſtructions to this Purpoſe: That the King and Royal
Family ſhould be traduced, as being Papiſts, and arbitrarily
affected from the Beginning; That King <hi>Charles</hi> I. had an
Hand in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; and that <hi>Charles</hi> II. did counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the ſame, by preferring <hi>Fitz-Gerrald, Fitz-Patrick,</hi> and
<hi>Mount-Garret,</hi> who were engaged in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; That
the Act, forbidding to call the King a Papiſt, was to ſtop Mens
Mouths, when he ſhould encline to further Popery; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by his adhering ſo cloſely to the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
and hindring him from being proceeded againſt by the

<hi>York,</hi> to be turned out; and for that, the Privy-Councellors
and Juſtices of the Peace, who were for the Proteſtant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
were turned out of all Places of Truſt; That it was as
much in the Power of the People, to depoſe a Popiſh Poſſeſſor,
as a Popiſh Succeſſor; and ſeeing there was no Hopes, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
when they met at <hi>Oxford,</hi> could do any Good, the
People were bound to provide for themſelves.</p>
            <p>This was no ſooner ended, but they agreed to meet the next Day there again; And <hi>Everard</hi> ſent Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be preſent, ſecretly, and to whom <hi>Everard,</hi> upon his
coming, gave 2 Copies of the Inſtructions aboveſaid, which
Sir <hi>William</hi> marked: Sooner after came <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring

thought it not full enough, but would have it fair wrote over
for the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador's Confeſſor. After this, <hi>Everard</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to give him Inſtructions in Writing; which <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
did, and in which Paper he wrote this Paſſage, <hi>That it was in

with him, but came next Day again for a Copy fair writ out,

And that he ſhould be brought into the Cabal, where ſeveral
Proteſtants and Parliament-Men were to give an Account to
the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador of what was tranſacted. But before <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>

And ſince there can be no Truſt given to this goodly
Couple of Popiſh Brethren, nor no Relief expected from a
Parliament; Truſt to your Swords, in Defence of your Lives,
Laws, Religion and Properties, like the ſtout Earl of Old,
who told a King, <hi>That if he could not be defended by</hi> Magna
Charta, <hi>he would be relieved by</hi> Longa Spada.</p>
                     <p>Yet to convince the World, that this <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Race is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, Root and Branch, and Popiſh from the very Beginning, be pleas'd to conſider theſe Reaſons following:</p>
                     <p>The Grandfather of theſe Men, <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> was of no Religion at the Bottom, but entred by a Pretence of a Sham-Plot of the Papiſts againſt his Life, whilſt really he collogued
with the Popiſh Party under-hand; his Mother, his Kindred,
and Companions were <hi>French</hi> and Papiſts; when he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England,</hi> he wrote to the Pope, with great Submiſſion, yet
afterwards thinking it for his Purpoſe to Cajole the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and write againſt the Pope and Cardinals, he ſends a
<hi>Scot</hi>'s Bird to blind the Eyes of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Keeper with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and to ſteal his Letters from off the Roman File, and then
he crows as boldly as an unſuſpected Harlot, for the Proteſtant
Religion and Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>That Man's Son, <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, held a Secret Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the Pope, calling him his Dear and Holy Father, as is to be ſeen in his Letters recorded in <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Did he not countenance and promote the Rebellion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Grandees, and his very Commiſſions teſtifie
and declare? Was there not a Popiſh Plot, and an Univerſal
Conſpiracy of the Papiſts diſcovered to him, and his Confeſſor
<hi>Laud?</hi> And did they not piouſly ſtifle it, left they ſhould have
diſcovered the Nakedneſs of their Mother-Church? Whilſt
that goodly Proteſtant Prince pretended to relieve the poor
beſieged Proteſtants at <hi>Rochel,</hi> by his Confident <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
Did he not hold Correſpondence with the <hi>French</hi> Cardinal, how
to betray them for a Sum of Money (which his Obſtinacy with
his Parliament made him ſtand in need of?) But they who
ſo ill approved themſelves to be Heads of the Proteſtant
Church, <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Laud,</hi> Did they not looſe their own
Heads by a manifeſt Judgment of God? And was not the
falſe Heart of their Emiſſary <hi>Buckingham,</hi> found out by an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſine's
Knife?</p>
                     <p>But to come nearer to our Purpoſe, theſe Two goodly Imps of our Days are ſtark naught; arrived at the Heighth of Wickedneſs, and of profeſſed Arbitrarineſs and Popery.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>James,</hi> he was a Papiſt whilſt he had a Regiment in the <hi>French,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service beyond Seas. And, for <hi>Charles,</hi> he was reported, e're he came into <hi>England,</hi>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:62930:61"/>
to have been reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in one of the
<hi>French</hi> King's Country-Houſes; and ſince they came in, How
have they wheedled and played Faſt and Looſe, in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Religion, as Occaſion and their Affairs requir'd?
Have they not all along maintained Secret Correſpondence
with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome?</hi> As <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters may ſufficiently
inſtruct ſuch, who have not ſeen more Secret Memoirs.</p>
                     <p>But let us come to Examine their Actions, which are a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Proof of their Hearts; Were not the Duke's Servants and Confidents all Papiſts? Witneſs his Talbots, Patricks, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Teagues; Were not the Duke, and ſuch of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as were known Papiſts, promoted to all Publick Offices
of Truſt, both at Sea and Land? Witneſs <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> now a
Traytor in the <hi>Tower;</hi> Did not <hi>James</hi> by <hi>Coleman, Throgmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and others, hold open Correſpondence with the Pope and
Cardinals? And could <hi>Charles</hi> be ignorant of all this? Nay,
he lik'd all ſo well, that he hardly employed any about him
but Papiſts, as <hi>Clifford,</hi> whom he made Treaſurer; or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
any Abroad but Perſons of the ſame Stamp; witneſs
<hi>Godolphin,</hi> whom he ſent Embaſſador into <hi>Spain,</hi> as he did
others elſewhere? What more obvious than that, though
the Duke's Treachery againſt the Kingdom and Proteſtant
Religion, be fully made out, and the People and Parliament
ſeek to bring him to a Legal Tryal, yet <hi>Charles</hi> obſtructs Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and will not ſuffer it? How can this be, but that he is
joyned in Will and Deed in all the Duke's Villanies; and that
he is afraid to be diſcovered and found out to be a Papiſt, and
a Betrayer of his People and the Proteſtant Religion? If he
was heartily concerned for our Religion, would he not oppoſe
a Popiſh Succeſſor, who will infallibly overthrow it? Can
there be any Thing more evident, than that he continues the
Duke's Adherents, and thoſe who were advanced by him, in
all Offices of Truſt? And hath he not turn'd out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
the moſt zealous Proteſtants, ſuch as <hi>Shaftsbury, Eſſex</hi> and
others, and introduced in their Rooms other meer Tools, or
thoſe that are Popiſhly and Arbitrarily affected? Hath he not
modell'd all the Sheriffs and Juſtices throughout <hi>England</hi> in
Subſerviency to a Popiſh Deſign? Was not Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> and divers others, turn'd out of the
Commiſſion in and about <hi>London,</hi> meerly for being zealous
Proſecutors of Prieſts and Papiſts? Doth not <hi>Charles</hi> all he
can to hinder the further Detection of the Popiſh Plot? And
doth he not to his utmoſt diſcountenance the Diſcoverers of
it, and ſuffer them to want Bread? And doth he not in the
mean time plentifully encourage and reward <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> and
all the Sham-plotters? Whereas <hi>Dangerfield</hi> had 8 <hi>l.</hi> a Week,
whilſt a Forger of Plots againſt the Proteſtants, he is caſt off
with ſcorn, and in danger of his Life, ſince he laid open the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62930:61"/>
Popiſh Engineers. Is not <hi>Ch.</hi> ſo much in love with his Popiſh
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s (therein treading in his Father's Steps) that he
promotes <hi>Montgarret, Carlingford, Fitz-Patrick</hi> and others,
who were the Heads of the Rebellion, to Honours and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though <hi>Charles</hi> took the Covenant, and a Coronation-Oath,
to preſerve the Proteſtant Religion, yet hath he not
palpably broken them? He made large Promiſes and Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at <hi>Breda,</hi> for the allowing a perpetual Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to Non-conforming Proteſtants, but he ſoon forgot
them all: To what End was the Act which was made ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Reſtoration, prohibiting any to call him Papiſt, or to
ſay he was Popiſhly enclin'd, and rendring ſuch as ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
guilty of a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> but to ſtop the Peoples Mouths,
whenever he ſhould act any Thing in Favour of Popery, as he
was then reſolved to do?</p>
                     <p>Is it not manifeſt therefore, that <hi>Scotch</hi> Oaths, <hi>Breda</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Proteſtant Profeſſion, Liberty of Conſcience, War with <hi>France,</hi> ſaving of <hi>Flanders,</hi> is all in Jeſt, to delude Proteſtant
Subjects? Is it not apparent, that breaking of Leagues, <hi>Dutch</hi>
Wars, <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet, <hi>French</hi> Meaſures to favour their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
Loſs of Ships, War in Chriſtendom, Blood of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
reprieving of Popiſh Traytors, is all in Earneſt, and
done in favour of Popery? And are not his fair Speeches, his
true Proteſtant Love to Parliaments juſt Rights, and <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Liberties, his pretended Ignorance of the Plot, and his hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Traytors to ſerve a Turn, but in meer Jeſt? Are not
his great Debaucheries, his Whoring Courtiers, Popiſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
Cheating Rogues, Helliſh Plottings, his ſaving of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
his <hi>French</hi> Penſioners, his Neſts of Whores, and Swarms
of Baſtards, his Macks, his Cut-Throats, his horrid Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
his Burning of <hi>London,</hi> and the Provoſt's Houſe too, his
Sham-plotting, his ſuborn'd Villains, his Popiſh Officers by

with <hi>France,</hi> his frequent Diſſolutions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
his buying of Voices, his falſe Returns, all of them
Deſigns to ruine us in good Earneſt, and in favour of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Government? And is it not in order to this bleſſed End,
that you ſee none countenanced by <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> but
Church Papiſts, betraying Biſhops, tantivy Abhorrers, bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Touzers, Popiſh Scriblers to deceive the People, and ſix

Brethren in Iniquity, corrupt both in Root and Branch, and
who ſtudy to enſlave <hi>England</hi> to a <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Yoak, is not
all this plain? Have you not Eyes, Senſe or Feeling? Where
is the Old Engliſh Noble Spirit? Are you become <hi>French</hi> Aſſes,
to ſuffer any Load to be laid upon you? And therefore, if you
can get no Remedy from this next Parliament (as certainly you
will not;) and if <hi>Charles</hi> doth not repent and comply with it,
then up all as one Man. O brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, look to your

How many oppreſſing Kings have been depoſed in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Hiſtory of the Succeſſion: Were not <hi>Richard</hi> II. and
<hi>Henry</hi> VI. both laid aſide, not to mention others; and was

for going about to embrace the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion,
and for entring into a League with the K. of <hi>Morocco,</hi> to that

were no ſuch Enemies to our Rights and Liberties, as <hi>Popery</hi>

for the Maintaining of their Liberties and Religion in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream

            <p>The Deſign you may ſee was to be carried on in the Name of the Non-conformiſts, and fixt upon them, and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed by the Peny-Poſt, to the Proteſting Lords, and Leading
Men in the Houſe of Commons, who were immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
to be taken up and ſearched. <hi>Everard</hi> affirmed, The
Court had an Hand it, and that the King had given <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
Money, and would give him more, if it had Succeſs. And
this is ſo much the more to be credited, ſince the King himſelf
told Sheriff <hi>Corniſh, That</hi> Fitz-Harris <hi>had,</hi> 3 <hi>Months before his
Apprehenſion, been with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im, and acquainted him he was in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of a Plot, which very much related to His Majeſty's Perſon and
Government,</hi> &amp;c. And that upon Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>'s acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King with the Particulars he had taken, while he was
concealed, as aforeſaid; tho' he thanked him for it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> to iſſue out a Warrant for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and that Sir <hi>William</hi> ſhould take Care
of the Execution of it; Yet he was no ſooner gone, but Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
ſaid, <hi>He was informed by</hi> 2 <hi>worthy Gentlemen, That the King
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62930:62"/>
was highly offended with him,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He had broken all his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
and that he would one Way or other have him taken off.
Fitz-Harris,</hi> however, was ſoon after taken, and committed
to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where being examined by Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and
Sheriff <hi>Corniſh,</hi> he diſcovered a Diſpoſition, and at length a
Willingneſs to diſcover the whole Deſign the next Day after.
But to prevent it, in all appearance, he was that Day removed
into the Tower.</p>
            <p>But while this hopeful Buſineſs was thus jumbled up, the Time ſpun out, and the 21ſt of <hi>March</hi> came, when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment met at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and of which the Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were generally the ſame as the laſt Parliament; and thoſe
that were not ſo, were of the ſame Kidney as the others had
been; ſo that their Proceedings began where the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
left off. They far, indeed, but 7 Days, and of them the
Lower Houſe ſpent the firſt 3, in chooſing their Speaker, and
confirming him, and taking the Oaths, as the Laws directed;
But in that little time, they had theſe 4 Conſiderations before
them; 1. The preparing a Bill to prevent the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s
ſucceeding to the Crown. The 2d was to take the Bill of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of the Act of the 35th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> out of the Houſe of Lords.
A 3d was an Enquiry into <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> his Buſineſs: And the
4th was to proſecute the Popiſh Lords in the Tower. But this
was more Work by a great deal, than the ſtinted Opportunity
of 4 Days would admit a Diſpatch of. However, upon <hi>Friday</hi>
the 25th of <hi>Mar.</hi> after that the Houſe had been ſome time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Debate of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Concern; and that one of the
Members had reported, That he remembred that one <hi>Hubert</hi>
having confeſs'd, he had fired the City of <hi>London;</hi> and that
the Houſe then ſitting, having reſolved thereupon to examine
him, they were prevented by his being hanged next Morning
before they met; And that there having been alſo a Deſign to
try the Lords in the Tower, by way of Indictment, the Houſe
had prevented the ſame by exhibiting general Impeachments
againſt them with that Succeſs, that the Lords were never try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon Indictments, and the Judges had given their Opinion,
they could not; This moved them that ſame Day, to order an
Impeachment againſt <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi> and appointed Sir <hi>Lionel
Jenkins</hi> to carry it up to the Houſe of Lords, who at firſt refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it, ſaying, <hi>That his being ſent upon that Meſſage, reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King his Maſter, and let them do what they would, he would
not go.</hi> But ſeveral of the Members having moved thereupon
to call him to the Bar of the Houſe; and divers others in their
Speeches aggravating highly his Offence, he at laſt relented,
and carried the Impeachment to the Houſe of Lords, but the
Lords threw it out; At which the Commons next Day, which
was <hi>Saturday</hi> the 26th, were ſo nettled, that they ran very
high in their Debates upon it, ripping up ſeveral ſharp Things
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62930:63"/>
againſt the Lords Proceedings herein; So that at laſt it was
moved, That if any Judge, Juſtice, or Jury proceeded upon
<hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and that he were found guilty, that the Houſe
would declare them guilty of his Murder, and Betrayers of
the Rights of the Commons of <hi>England.</hi> To this it was add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
upon the Motion of Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi> or that any inferiour
Court ſhould proceed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was paſſed; But what little
Notice was taken hereof, you may hear by and by. The Houſe
hereupon adjourned to <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, <hi>March</hi> 27. when the
King coming ſuddenly and unexpectly into the Houſe of Peers,<note place="margin">The <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament diſſolved.</note>
diſſolved the Parliament, and immediately took Coach, and
made as hard as he could for <hi>Windſor,</hi> leaving both Houſes in
a grand Amazement, and the City of <hi>Oxford</hi> in an Hubbub.
Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> in his juſt and modeſt Vindication of this, and
the laſt Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſays, <hi>The Peers at</hi> Oxford
<hi>were wholly ignorant of the Council, and that they never thought
of a Diſſolution, till they heard the ſame pronounced.</hi> Yet it is
obſervable,<note place="margin">The King's Declaration after the Diſſolution of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> that the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mazarine</hi> publiſhed the News
at St. <hi>James</hi>'s many Hours before the ſame was done. But if
the Nation, as well as the Parliament and City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> were
amazed at this Diſſolution, and the Manner thereof, they were
no leſs ſo with the King's Declaration that followed; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
whereof was, The Diſſatisfaction of the King at the
Proceedings of the 2 laſt <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliaments, in giving
him no ſuitable Return, to ſupport the Alliances he had made
for the general Peace of Chriſtendom; nor for the further
Examination into the Plot; nor yet for the Preſervation of
<hi>Tangier;</hi> He ſhewed a mighty Concern at their Votes againſt
any Body's lending him Money upon the Revenues; and that
the Proſecution of Diſſenters, was a Grievance to the Subject,
by which he ſaid, They aſſumed to themſelves a Power of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
Laws. But, as Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> obſerves well, the Commons
in that did nothing but what they might do, as well as in any
other Law they found by Experience to be grievous to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and muſt have done ſo, in order to the Repealing of them.
And if the Matter had been really ſo, as the Declaration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
the Crime had ſurely been ſomewhat the leſs in the
Commons; if his Majeſty had conſidered, that himſelf had
twice before done the ſame Thing by his Declarations of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
tho' to a contrary End to what the Commons intended.
That theſe Things had cauſed him to diſſolve them, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
another at <hi>Oxford;</hi> who ſtill purſuing the ſame Methods
in the Buſineſs of the Excluſion of the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> which
he could by no Means give way to, tho' he was willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of any other Expedient, whereby the Eſtabliſhed Religion
might be preſerved, (tho' he never propounded any;) And
the 2 Houſes imbroiling themſelves in the Buſineſs of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi>
ſo as they were put out of Capacity of tranſacting
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62930:63"/>
other Affairs, had cauſed him to put an End to that Parliament
alſo. But that, however, notwithſtanding the Malice of ill
Men to perſwade the People, that he intended to lay aſide the
Uſe of Parliaments, he declared, That no Irregularity in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſhould make him out of love with them, and that he
was reſolved to have frequent Parliaments, and in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
would uſe his utmoſt Endeavours to extirpate Popery, and
redreſs the Grievances of his Subjects. But how well he kept
his Word in reſpect to frequent Parliaments, or redreſſing his
Peoples Grievances in near 4 Years time he lived after, is ſo
notoriouſly known to the contrary, that there needs no Proof
of it. I'll ſay nothing in this place of the Invalidity of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
in it ſelf, ſince the Matter has been conteſted: But
the Gentleman whoſe Name was to it, and who thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo much injured, when it was taken notice of, that it bore
no other Authority but his, would have done well to have
made appear to the World, that the Broad-Seal was affix'd to
it, which hitherto he has not done. But be this as it will, tho'
the King did not communicate this Declaration to the Council
till <hi>Friday</hi> the 8th of <hi>Apr.</hi> yet the foreſaid Author, Sir <hi>W. J.</hi>
ſays, M. <hi>Barillon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador, read it upon the 5th
of <hi>April</hi> before, and demanded of a Gentleman there his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of it; which M. <hi>Barillon</hi> might the better remember, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the great Liberty the Gentleman took to ridicule it to
his Face.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> whom we left in the Tower; the poor Man was kept there for 10 Weeks together ſo cloſe a Priſoner, that neither his Wife, nor any other, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to come at him, (whereas the Popiſh Lords, impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Parliament, had the Liberty of the Tower, and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man to viſit them) and then there was an Indictment of
High Treaſon formed againſt him, for contriving a certain
Writing, called, <hi>The true Engliſh Man;</hi> and ſo on the laſt Day
of <hi>April</hi> he was Arraigned at the <hi>King's Bench-Bar:</hi> But his Wife,
in the mean time, having ſome Foreſight of her Husband's Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
had gone to Council, and had a Plea drawn to the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Court: To which the Attorney General demurred,
and <hi>Fitz-Harris's.</hi> Council joined in the Demurrer; then time
was given them to the <hi>Saturday</hi> following to maintain the ſaid
Plea by Argument, which was done accordingly; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended, the Lord Chief Juſtice declared, The Court would
take time to conſider before they gave in their Judgment;
which they did on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following, being the 11th of
<hi>May,</hi> when three of the Judges, to wit, the Chief Juſtice, and the
Judges, <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Raymond,</hi> were of Opinion, That the Plea
was ſufficient. But Juſtice <hi>Dolbin</hi> was doubtful. And ſo the
Plea was over-ruled, and the Priſoner was ordered to plead;
which he did, and the Trial put off till <hi>June</hi> 9, when he was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62930:64"/>
found Guilty of High-Treaſon, without any Benefit had at all
of the Impeachment of the Houſe of Commons. But its pitty
ſome of theſe Judges had not been hanged for their Pains, as
<hi>Treſilian</hi> was in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second. However, to
colour the matter yet a little, and that the Court might ſtill
make a feint, which was their laſt, of proſecuting the Popiſh
Plot in the right Courſe of it; <hi>Oliver Plunket</hi> was, <hi>June</hi> 1, in
Trinity Term tried for High-Treaſon at the Kings Bench Bar,
for that he was made Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Pope, at the
<hi>French</hi> King's Recommendation; that upon that account he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
engaged to do that King all the Service that lay in his
Power, he had actually levied among his Popiſh Clergy, great
Sums of Money, therewith to introduce the <hi>French</hi> Dominion

               </note> The firſt that felt the Weight
of their Indignation, was one <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> commonly
known by the Name of <hi>The Proteſtant Joyner,</hi> a mean Man, but
a great Talker againſt the Popiſh Plot; againſt whom an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
of High-Treaſon was exhibited to the Grand Jury,
whereof Mr. <hi>Wilmore</hi> was Fore-man; But this Indictment would
not go down; For the Grand Jury returned an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon
it, for which <hi>Wilmore</hi> was apprehended, and examined before
the Council <hi>Aug.</hi> 16, and ſent to the Tower, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
forced to fly his Country. But tho' the Deſign thus miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
in <hi>London,</hi> yet the Party would not be diſcouraged, and
ſo they laid a new Scene againſt <hi>Colledge</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where they
hoped to find a more plyable Grand Jury: And to make ſure
that the Bill might not miſcarry, the King's Council had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

               </gap>izes to poſt thither, and were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
privately ſhut up with the Jury till they had found the
Bill, which was a moſt unjuſtifiable and intolerable Practice.
But becauſe they would ſeem to allow the poor Man all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Advantage imaginable for his own Defence, tho'
they kept him as cloſe in the Tower as they did <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi>
yet they allow'd him one <hi>Weſt</hi> for his Sollicitor; but it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with an intent to betray him. For as ſoon as the Bill was
found againſt him, one <hi>Murtel</hi> a Goaler, and <hi>Sawel</hi> a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
were diſpatch'd to bring him to his Trial; Who, after
they had taken him out of Priſon, ran him into an Houſe, and by
order of the King's Council, took from him all his Inſtructions
for his Defence, which were carried to them, as well to diſable
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62930:64"/>
him to make his Defence, as to inable them how to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him by ſome way he was not provided for to plead for
himſelf. I will not enter into a further detail of this way of
Procedure, but certainly it was the moſt barbarous and illegal,
I think, that ever was heard of; and the whole was nothing
elſe but a Combination of the Judges, (whereof Sir <hi>Francis
North</hi> was Chief, and the Mouth of the Court) King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
Jury and Evidence, as may be ſeen at large in Sir <hi>John
Hawles</hi>'s Learned Obſervations upon his Trial; Yet after all,
the Man under theſe ſevere Circumſtances, was not wanting
to himſelf, but ſtoutly made his Defence, and perhaps (as the
ſaid Learned Perſon obſerves) the beſt Defence, all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
conſider'd, that ever Man made for his Life. But had
he defended himſelf with the Tongue of Men and Angels, it had
availed him nothing; For it was a matter reſolved upon, and
he muſt die; and ſo he was <hi>Aug.</hi> 18. found guilty of High-Treaſon,
and on the 31ſt of the ſame Month, executed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>The ſame Deſigns, as againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> were formed againſt my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and took ſo far, that being taken up at his Houſe in <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet, July</hi> the 2d. and brought before
the Council at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> (whither the King came that day on
purpoſe from <hi>Windſor</hi>) he was committed to the Tower; But
notwithſtanding an Inventory of Rogues they got to ſwear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and all their Practices upon Captain <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> who
proved too honeſt to be tempted, even by <hi>bleſſed Memory</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who failed not to attack him to that end at the Secretaries
Office; The Grand Jury, <hi>Nov.</hi> 24, whereof that worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton,</hi> was Foreman; and for all the
whole Bench of Judges ſat in Court to influence the matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon the Bill; whereat all the People diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their Satisfaction and good Will to the Nation, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a general Shout, but with ſuch Indignation againſt the
Raſcally Hireling-Witneſſes, that they would have torn them
to pieces, had it not been for the prudent care of the Sheriffs
to prevent it; as alſo by making ſeveral Bone-fires that Night
in the City.</p>
            <p>His Royal Highneſs was all this while in <hi>Scotland,</hi> moulding that Nation under a Proteſtant Mask, for a Popiſh Succeſſor and Government, the Parliament there chimed in with him,
and made a Teſt and other Acts, which, in the main, were leſs
binding than what were in force before; and whereat many of
the Members ſeemed ſo diſſatisfied, that they deſired other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and Acts, which the Duke in open Parliament promiſed,
when Time and Opportunity offered; but when at any time
that was propoſed, the Teſt was obtruded. Among the reſt,
there had been an Act made that was leſs binding to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
to the Crown, as to his own Profeſſion; The Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:62930:65"/>
propoſed at the paſſing thereof, That all other Acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Popery might be added; which was ſo contrary to the
Duke's Deſigns,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Caſe.</note> and ſo inraged him againſt the Earl, that all
Methods imaginable were propoſed to ruine him, which at
laſt was effected under a pretence of his putting his own Senſe
and Interpretation upon the Teſt, when he took it; (tho' others
had done it as well as he) and ſo the Earl was proſecuted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
with ſo much Cruelty, Unjuſtice and Oppreſſion, and by
ſuch execrable and partial Methods, that none could be guilty
of, but him that was at the Head of the Buſineſs, and his ſworn
Slaves; and he was upon the ſaid trivial Account, found guilty
of High-Treaſon, as you may read at large in the Earl's Caſe;
and indeed its worth any honeſt Mans reading; but I would not
curtail it here, and to inſert it at large, would not be conſiſtent
with the preſent Deſign. However, that brave Man made a
ſhift to eſcape his Deſtiny at that time, by exchanging Cloaths
with his Daughter, and ſo getting privately out of <hi>Edenburg</hi>-Caſtle,
and flying beyond the Seas; tho' he could not do it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
but fell a Sacrifice to the ſame Revenge that thus
made him firſt miſerable. But while our Royal Pair were act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the T—againſt their innocent Subjects, Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
the <hi>French</hi> were playing another part abroad, which,
in my Mind, let others think what they liſt, was not near ſo
bad, tho' I do not at all juſtifie it.</p>
            <p>You have heard before, how that after the Concluſion of the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> ſtill continued their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to ſome Places both in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and on the <hi>Rhine;</hi>
Concerning which laſt, we have already given you the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
of the Emperor to the Dyet of <hi>Ratlsbone,</hi> and their Reſult
thereupon. Now there was no City on that ſide ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
from time to time, as <hi>Strasburg;</hi> and of this there were
frequent Accounts given, even in the publick News of thoſe
days; But the <hi>French,</hi> the more to amuſe them this Year, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of their Troops in that order, that it was but <hi>Sept.</hi> 13
that they wrote from that City, that they were very eaſie in
thoſe Parts, the <hi>French</hi> Troops being gone into their Winter
Quarters; and that it was likely to be ſo with them, ſince the
<hi>French</hi> King's Deſigns were towards <hi>Italy;</hi> tho' at the ſame
time they could not but take notice of the great Magazines that
were provided both in <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Alſace.</hi> But they, or the
Rogues amongſt them, who betray'd them, might flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as long as they pleaſed, with the thoughts of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity;
Whereas the <hi>French</hi> King was this very Month ſet
out toward their Frontiers, having ſent M, <hi>Louvois</hi> before to
draw the Troops ſuddenly together for the Enterprize. One
ſhould think it a ſtrange thing, that a Perſon whoſe great Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
was to be a Miniſter of a State, and no Souldier, among
ſo many profeſs'd Souldiers and great Commanders, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62930:65"/>
               <hi>France</hi> abounded, ſhould be ſingled out to perform this
Military Enterprize; But upon ſecond Thoughts, it will it be
allowed to have been a piece of Juſtice, to grant him, who
had made the Bargain, the honour of taking Poſſeſſion; for
Mr. <hi>Louvois</hi> was fouly belyed, if he had uot been divers times
at <hi>Strasburg, inoognito,</hi> to that end, as well as in greater
Places. And we have known <hi>Richlieu</hi> occaſionally lead the
<hi>French</hi> Army over the <hi>Alps</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Mazarine</hi> has often
acted that part on other Occaſions. But to return, Mr.
<hi>Louvois</hi> having uſed great Diligence and Secreſie, appear'd
with a great number of Troops before <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and the
very ſame Day order'd a Regiment of Dragoons to ſeize
upon the Fort of <hi>Kiel,</hi> that guards the Bridge of the City,
and ſent the Magiſtrates Word; That the King expected they
ſhould render him the Oath of Fidelity and Obedience, due
to him by the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> which had yielded to him
all the <hi>Vpper</hi> and <hi>Lower Alſatia,</hi> and conſequently that City,
which was the Capital thereof, (a pretty Pretence indeed!)
and ſhould receive a Garriſon of his Troops into it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

Work whereof was, the barbarous Proſecution of Proteſtant
Diſſenters,<note place="margin">Proteſtant Diſſenters Proſecuted.</note> and how to curb the reſt of the Nation, ſo as to
truckle entirely under che Court-girdle: Herein they made

to be ſent from all Quarters: But the <hi>Ignoramus</hi>-Bill of
my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſtuck deep in their Stomachs, and the Fears
of being baulked in any ſuch Deſign for the future, made
them ſet their Wits on the Tenter-Hooks, how they might
take away the Election of Sheriffs out of the Power of the
City; and no other Expedient could be found, but by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away their Charter; which, if once effected, would not
only give the Court the advantage of making Sheriffs, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
a Gap to their making a Houſe of Commons too, for
near 5 Parts in 6 of the Houſe of Commons were Burgeſſes
and Barons of the Cinque-Ports, who would not dare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
their Charter if the City of <hi>London</hi> could not hold hers:
So that in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term this Year a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was brought
againſt the City for two helnous Crimes, <hi>viz.</hi> That they had
made an Addreſs to the King for the Parliament to Sit for
Redreſs of Grievances, and to ſettle the Nation; (yet King
<hi>Charles</hi> I. thought the Parliament's Vote of Non-Addreſſes
to him was Depoſing of him) and that the City had raiſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

curſorily as we can; and thus it was: The City pleaded their
Right; and the King replied; upon which there was a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer;
and here the matter reſted for a time, the Novelty
whereof cauſing a great Amuſement in the Generality of the
City and Nation whereto it tended, and how it would end. In

his Work in that Kingdom, was returned to <hi>London;</hi> and his
Zeal for promoting the Catholick Cauſe outgoing his Patience

<hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> there appeared Courtiers of the firſt Magnitude
bare-fac'd for the next Election of Sheriffs, and Sir <hi>Dudley

will end this ſhort Year, but pernicious enough to <hi>England;</hi> and

he was engaged with too much Fury and Ravage in the Party of
his Uncle King <hi>Charles;</hi> in our unhappy Civil Wars) had of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62930:67"/>
late Years proved a faithful Councellor to the King, and a
great Patriot to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty; and therefore was towards
his latter end, neglected by the Court to that degree, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
paſſed between him and his great Kindred but Civilities
in the Common Forms. But though the Court had gained this
Point, yet they thought it not fit at preſent to puſh it farther,
till the Demurrer to the City-Charter was determined, in
which ſuch haſte was made, that only two Arguments were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
on either ſide; one in <hi>Hillary</hi>-Term, 1683. and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term following; and ſo Judgment was given in
<hi>Trinity</hi>-Term next after againſt the City. But ſuch a Judgment
was never given in any Caſe as this; and if the manner of
Electing the laſt Sheriffs was ſtrange and unwarrantable, this
was no leſs ſo; for it was without any Reaſon given, and
by two Judges only; whereof the one was Sir <hi>Francis Withens</hi>
(who had heard but one Argument, and perhaps underſtood

                  <q>
                     <p>I Thank God, I find my ſelf ſo compoſed, and prepared for Death, and my Thoughts ſo fixed on another World, that I hope in God I am quite from ſetting my Heart on this;
Yet I cannot forbear now the ſetting down in Writing, a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Account of my Condition, to be left behind me, than
I will venture to ſay at the Place of Execution, in the Noiſe
and Clutter that is like to be there. I bleſs God heartily for
thoſe many Bleſſings which he, in his Infinite Mercy, has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon me through the whole Courſe of my Life;
That I was born of worthy good Parents, and had the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of a Religious Education, which are invaluable Bleſſings;
For, even when I minded it leaſt, it ſtill hung about me, and
gave me Checks, and has now, for many Years, ſo influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
and poſſeſſed me, that I feel the happy Effects of it in
this my Extremity, in which I have been ſo wonderfully (I
thank God) ſupported, that neither my Impriſonment, nor fear
of Death, have been able to diſcompoſe me in any Degree;
but on the contrary, I have found the Aſſurances of the
Love and Mercy of God, in, and through my Bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
in whom only I truſt: And I do not queſtion but
that I am going to partake of that Fullneſs of Joy which is in
his Preſence: The Hopes therefore do ſo wonderfully delight
me, that I think this is the happieſt Time of my Life, though
others may look upon it as the ſaddeſt.</p>
                     <p>I have lived, and now am of the Reform'd Religion, a true and ſincere Proteſtant, and in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though I could never yet comply with,
or riſe up to all the Heighths of many People. I wiſh with
all my Soul all our differences were removed; and that all
ſincere Proteſtants would ſo far conſider the danger of Popery,
as to lay aſide their Heats, and agree againſt the Common
Enemy; and that the Church-men would be leſs ſevere, and
the Diſſenters leſs ſcrupulous; for I think bitterneſs, and
Perſecution are at all times bad, but much more now.</p>
                     <p>For Popery, I look on it as an Idolatrous and bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; <pb n="119" facs="tcp:62930:68"/>
and therefore thought my ſelf bound, in my Station,
to do all I could againſt it: And by that I foreſaw I ſhould
procure ſuch great Enemies to my ſelf, and ſo powerful
ones, that I have been now for ſome time expecting the
worſt; and bleſſed be God, I fall by the Ax, and not by the
Fiery Tryal: Yet, whatever Apprehenſions I had of Popery,
and of my own ſevere and heavy ſhare I was like to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it when it ſhould prevail, I never had a Thought of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing againſt it baſely, or inhumanely, but what
would well conſiſt with the Chriſtian Religion, and
the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom: And, I thank
God, I have examined all my Actions in that matter with ſo
great Care, that I can appeal to God Almighty, who knows
my Heart, that I went on ſincerely, without being moved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Paſſion, By-Ends, or ill Deſign. I have always lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
my Countrey much more than my Life; and never had
any Deſign of changing the Government, which I value, and
look upon as one of the beſt Governments in the World,
and would always have been ready to venture my Life for the
preſerving it, and would ſuffer any Extremity, rather than
have conſented to any Deſign of taking away the King's
Life: Neither had any Man the Impudence to propoſe ſo
baſe and barbarous a thing to me: And I look upon it as a
very unhappy and uneaſie part of my preſent Condition, that
there ſhould be ſo much as Mention made of ſo vile a Fact,
though nothing in the leaſt was ſaid to prove any ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but the contrary, by my Lord <hi>Howard;</hi> Neither does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Body, I am confident, believe the leaſt of it: So that I
need not, I think, ſay more.</p>
                     <p>For the King, I do ſincerely pray for him, and wiſh well to him, and to the Nation, that they may be happy in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that he may be indeed the <hi>Defender of the Faith;</hi>
that the Proteſtant Religion, and the Peace and Safety of the
Kingdom may be preſerv'd, and flouriſh under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that himſelf, in his Perſon may be happy both
here and hereafter.</p>
                     <p>As for the Share I had in the Proſecution of the Popiſh Plot, I take God to Witneſs, that I proceeded in it in the Sincerity of my Heart, being then really convinced (as I am ſtill)
that there was a Conſpiracy againſt the King, the Nation,
and the Proteſtant Religion: And I likewiſe profeſs, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew any thing directly or indirectly of any Practice with
the Witneſſes, which I look upon as ſo horrid a thing, that
I never could have endured it: For, I thank God, Falſhood
and Cruelty were never in my Nature, but always the
fartheſt from it imaginable. I did believe, and do ſtill,
that Popery is breaking in upon the Nation; and that thoſe
that advance it, will ſtop at nothing to carry on their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62930:69"/>
I am heartily ſorry that ſo many Proteſtants give their
helping hand to it: But I hope God will preſerve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, and this Nation, though I am afraid it will
fall under very great Trials, and very ſharp Sufferings: And
indeed, the Impiety and Profaneneſs that abounds, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
ſo ſcandalouſly bare-faced every where, gives too juſt
an Occaſion to fear the worſt thing that can befal a People.
I pray God prevent it, and give thoſe who have ſhewed a
Concern for the publick Good, and have appeared hearty
for the true Intereſt of the Nation, and the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Grace to live ſo, that they may not caſt a Reproach on
that which they, endeavour to advance; which (God knows)
has often given me ſad Thoughts; And I, hope ſuch of my
Friends as may think they are touched by this, will not take
what I ſay in ill Part, but will endeavour to amend their
ways, and live ſuitable to the Rules of the true Reformed
Religion; which is the only thing can adminiſter true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
at the latter end, and relieve a Man when he comes to
die.</p>
                     <p>As for my preſent Condition, I bleſs God, I have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>pining in my Heart at it; I know for my Sins I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved much worſe at the Hands of God, ſo that I chearfully
ſubmit, to ſo ſmall a Puniſhment, as the being taken off a
few Years ſooner, and the being made a Spectacle to the
Worl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. I do freely, forgive all the World, particularly
thoſe concerned in taking away my Life; and I deſire and
conjure all my Friends to think of no Revenge, but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Holy Will of God, into whoſe Hands I reſign my
ſelf entirely.</p>
                     <p>But to look back a little, I cannot but give ſome touch about the Bill of Excluſion, and ſhew the Reaſons of my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in that Buſineſs, which in ſhort, is this; That I
thought the Nation in ſuch Danger of Popery, and that the
Expectation of a Popiſh Succeſſor (as I have ſaid in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
put the King's Life likewiſe in much Danger, that I ſaw
no way ſo effectual to ſecure both, as ſuch a Bill. As to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
that were propoſed, if they were ſincerely offered,
and had paſſed into a Law, the Duke then ſhould have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the Power of a King, and the Government quite
altered, and a little more than the Name of a King left.
So I could not ſee either Sin or Fault in the one, when all
People were willing to admit of the other; But thought it
better to have a King with his Prerogative, and the Nation
eaſie and ſafe under him, than a King without it; which bred
perpetual Jealouſies, and a continual Struggle. All this I ſay,
only to Juſtifie my S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ir, and not to en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lame others; Though
I cannot but think my earneſtneſs in that matter, has had no
ſmall Influence in my preſent Sufferings. But I have now
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62930:69"/>
done with this World, and am going to a Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
cannot be moved.</p>
                     <p>And as to the conſpiring to ſeize the Guards, which is the Crime for which I am Condemned, and which is made a Conſtructive Treaſon for taking away the King's Life, to
bring it within the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. I ſhall give this true
and clear Account. I never was at Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi>'s with
that Company, but once, and there was no undertaking then
of ſecuring, or ſeizing the Guards, nor none appointed to
view, or examine them. Some Diſcourſe there was of the
feaſibleneſs of in, and ſeveral times by Accident in general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
elſewhere, I have heard it mentioned as a thing might
eaſily be done, but never conſented to, as a thing fit to be
done: And I remember particularly at my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s,
there being ſome general Diſcourſe of this kind; I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
flow out, and exclaimed againſt it, and asked, if the
thing ſucceeded, what muſt be done next but maſtering the
Guards, and killing them in cold Blood; which I looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a deteſtable thing, and ſo like a Popiſh Practice, that
I could not but abhor it. And at the ſame time the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> took me by the Hand, and told me very kindly,
<hi>My Lord, I ſee you and I are of a Temper, did you ever hear ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
a thing?</hi> And I muſt needs do him Juſtice to declare, that
I ever obſerved in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him an Abhorrence of all baſe things.</p>
                     <p>As to my going to Mr. <hi>Shepheard's,</hi> I went with an Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to taſte Sherry; For he had promiſed to reſerve for me the next very good Piece he met with, when I went out of Town:
And if he recollects himſelf, he may remember I asked him
about it, and he went and fetch'd a Bottle; but when I taſted
it I ſaw it was hot in the Mouth, and deſired that whenever
he met with a choice Piece, he would keep it for me; which
he promiſed. I enlarge the more upon this, becauſe Sir
<hi>George Jefferys</hi> inſinuated to the Jury, as if I had made a Story
about going thither; but I never ſaid that was the only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and I will now truly and plainly add you the reſt.</p>
                     <p>I was, the day before this Meeting, come to Town for two or three days, as I had done once or twice before, having a very near and dear Relation lying in a Languiſhing and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Condition; and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> came to me,
and told me, He was extreamly glad I was come to Town; for
my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and ſome hot Men would undo us all.
How ſo, my Lord, I ſaid, Why (anſwered he) they will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do ſome diſorderly thing or other, if great Care be not
taken; and therefore for God's Sake, uſe your Endeavour with
your Friends to prevent any thing of this kind. He told me,
there would be Company at Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi>'s that Night,
and deſired me to be at home in the Evening, and he would
call me, which he did. And when I came into the Room, I
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62930:70"/>
ſaw Mr. <hi>Rumſey</hi> by the Chimney, though he ſwears he came
in after; And there were Things ſaid by ſome, with much
more Heat than Judgment, which I did ſufficiently diſapprove;
and yet for theſe Things I ſtand Condemned: But, I thank
God, my Part was ſincere and well meant. It is, I know, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from hence, and preſſed to me, That I was acquainted
with theſe Heats and ill Deſigns, and did not diſcover them;
But this is but Miſpriſion of Treaſon at moſt, ſo I die innocent
of the Crime I ſtand Condemned for; I hope no Body will
imagine that ſo mean a Thought ſhould enter into me, as to
go about to ſave my ſelf by accuſing others. The Part that ſome
have acted lately of that kind, has not been ſuch as to invite
me to love Life at ſuch a Rate.</p>
                     <p>As for the Sentence of Death paſſed upon me, I cannot but think it a very hard one; for nothing was ſworn againſt me (whether true or falſe, I will not now examine) but ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
about making ſome Stirs: And this is not levying War
againſt the King, which is Treaſon by the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.
and not the Conſulting and Diſcourſing about it, which was all
that was witneſſed againſt me; but by a ſtrange Fetch, the
Deſign of ſeizing the Guards, was conſtrued a Deſign of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the King, and ſo I was in that Caſt.</p>
                     <p>And now I have truly and ſincerely told what my Part was in that which cannot be more than a bare Miſpriſion, and yet I am condemned as guilty of a Deſign of killing the King. I
pray God lay not this to the Charge, neither of the King's
Councel, nor Judges, nor Sheriffs, nor Jury; And for the
Witneſſes, I pity them, and wiſh them well, I ſhall not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
up the Particulars, wherein they did me wrong; I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their own Conſciences would do that, to which, and the
Mercies of God, I leave them; Only I ſhall aver, that what
I ſaid of my not hearing Colonel <hi>Rumſey</hi> deliver any Meſſage
from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> was true; For I always deteſted
Lying, tho' never ſo much to my Advantage; And I hope
none will be ſo unjuſt and uncharitable, as to think I would
venture on it in theſe my laſt Words, for which I am ſo ſoon
to give an Account to the great God, the Searcher of Hearts,
and Judge of all Things.</p>
                     <p>From the Time of chooſing Sheriffs, I concluded the Heat in that Matter would produce ſomething of this Kind; and I am not much ſurprized to find it fall upon me; and I wiſh what
is done to me, may put a Stop, and ſatiate ſome People's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and that no more innocent Blood be ſhed; for I muſt,
and do ſtill look upon mine as ſuch, ſince I know I was guilty
of no Treaſon; and therefore, I would not betray my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
by flight, of which I do not (I thank God) yet repent,
(tho' much preſſed to it) how fatal ſoever it may have ſeemed
to have proved to me; for I look upon my Death in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62930:70"/>
(I thank God) with other Eyes than the World does. I
know I ſaid but little at the Trial, and I ſuppoſe it looks more
like Innocence than Guilt. I was alſo adviſed not to confeſs
Matter of Fact plainly, ſince that certainly muſt have brought
me within the Guilt of Miſpriſion; and being thus reſtrained
from dealing frankly and openly, I choſe rather to ſay little,
than to depart from that Ingenuity, that, by the Grace of
God, I had carried along with me in the former part of my Life,
and ſo could eaſier be ſilent, and leave the whole Matter to
the Conſciences of the Jury, than to make the beſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemneſt
part of my Life ſo different from the Courſe of it, as
the uſing little Tricks and Evaſions muſt have been; nor did
I ever pretend to any great Readineſs in Speaking. I wiſh
thoſe Gentlemen of the Law, who have it, would make more
Conſcience in the Uſe of it, and not run Men down, and by
Strains and Fetches impoſe on eaſie and willing Juries, to the
Ruine of innocent Men. For to kill by Forms and Subtilties
of the Law, is the worſt ſort of Murder. But I wiſh the Rage
of hot Men, and the Partiality of Juries, may be ſtopped with
my Blood, which I would offer up with ſo much the more Joy,
if I thought I ſhould be the laſt that were to ſuffer in ſuch a
Way.</p>
                     <p>Since my Sentence, I have had but few Thoughts, but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory ones for Death; yet the Importunity of my Friends, and particularly the beſt and deareſt Wife in the World, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with me to ſign Petitions, and make an Addreſs for my
Life, to which I was ever averſe; for (I thank God) though
in all Reſpects I have lived the happieſt and contente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſt Man
of the World (for now very near Fourteen Years) yet I am ſo
willing to leave all, that it was not without Difficulty that I
did any thing for the ſaving of my Life, that was begging;
but I was willing to let my Friends ſee what Power they had
over me, and I was not obſtinate nor ſullen, but would do
any thing that an honeſt Man could do for their Satisfaction,
which was the only Motive that ſwayed, or had any Weight
with me.</p>
                     <p>And now to ſum up all; As I had not any Deſign againſt the King's Life, or the Life of any Man whatſoever, ſo I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in any Contrivance of altering the Government.
What the Heats, Paſſions, and Vanities of other Men have
occaſioned, I ought not to be reſponſible for; nor could I help
them, though I now ſuffer for them: But the Will of the
Lord be done, into whoſe Hands I commend my Spirit; and
truſt that Thou, O moſt merciful Father, haſt forgiven me
all my Tranſgreſſions, the Sins of my Youth, and all the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors

me in my laſt Moments, and not leave me then to be diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Fear, or any other Temptations, but make the Light of
thy Countenance to ſhine upon me. Thou art my Sun and
my Shield, and as thou ſupporteſt me by thy Grace, ſo I hope
thou wilt hereafter Crown, me with Glory, and receive me
into the Fellowſhip of Angels and Saints, in that bleſſed Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
purchaſed for me by my moſt merciful Redeemer,
who is, I truſt, at thy Right Hand, preparing a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> Try'd.</note> who, for his noble Extract and Quality, was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to few, but for his excellent Vertues hardly to be match'd
by any; which laſt was eſpecially, a conſtant Eye-ſore to our
Court, and therefore he muſt be hooked Neck and Shoulders
into the Conſpiracy: But, though otherwiſe, he was a Perſon
of admirable Parts, yet he ſaid not much at his Tryal, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
whatever he ſhould ſay, would ſignifie nothing with
that Judicature, whom he thought had already prejudged him;
and ſo it was really, in effect; for, as the Learned Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi>
judiciouſly obſerved, He was meerly talked to Death, under the
Notion of a Commonwealths-man, and found Guilty by a Jury,
who were not much more proper Judges in the Caſe, than
they ſhould have been, if what he had writ had been done by
him in <hi>Syriac</hi> or <hi>Arabick.</hi> It's obſervable, the Indictment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him was never preſented to the Grand Jury, before they
came into the Hall, and yet they found it immediately, and
was, in ſubſtance, like the reſt; <hi>For a Conſpiracy to Depoſe the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62930:71"/>
King, and ſtirring up Rebellion; and,</hi> as an Addition, <hi>for writing
a Libel to that Purpoſe.</hi> The greateſt part of the Evidence (as
it was in my Lords <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Caſe) was only Hear-ſay; nay, <hi>Weſt,</hi>
whoſe Evidence was once rejected, muſt be admitted now, and
that to tell a long Story of what he had heard from one and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſon; the reſt, <hi>viz. Rumſey</hi> and my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s, with
his Council of 6, were much of the ſame Stamp; only my Lord
was very Rhetorical; even to Pedantry, upon the Matter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his vain, though uſual Cuſtom. But to clench the
Matter, there was a Paper found in the Priſoner's Study, ſaid
to be his Writing; the Subſtance whereof was, An Enquiry
into the ſeveral Forms of Government, and Reaſons of their
Decay; together with the Rights of the People, Bounds of
Sovereignty, and Original Power; wherein, among other
Things, were theſe Expreſſions: <hi>The King is ſubject to the Law
of God, as he is a Man; to the People that made him ſuch, as a
King:</hi> And, wherein there are Examples cited, how evil
Princes had been ſometimes deſtroyed by a Popular Fury, as
others had been depoſed. But where was the Treaſon of all
this? Or if it had been ſo, why did they not prove, that it
was his Hand-writing? But in ſhort, ſo far as any Man of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Principles, and good Senſe, has heard of them Papers,
they contained in them a great deal more Learning and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Principles, than the Chief Juſtice <hi>Jeffreys</hi> had Manners,
when, without any Regard to the Noble Family, and the Name
of the <hi>Sidneys,</hi> he ſaid the Priſoner was <hi>born a Tray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or.</hi> It will
be too long to run through all the Particulars; And therefore
I ſhall, and can only gratifie the Reader with ſomething that
was his own, and that is his laſt Speech at his Execution upon
<hi>Tower-Hill, Dec.</hi> 7. 1683, after I have firſt premiſed, that King
<hi>Charles</hi> ſhewed his uſual Gratitude to Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> (now the
Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Rumney</hi>) the Colonel's Brother,
in cutting him off for ſo trivial a Crime, if it was any, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not long before taken ſo much Pains to bring the Defenſive
League about with <hi>Holland,</hi> which his Majeſty valued himſelf
ſo much upon in Parliament, to ſay nothing of his Majeſty's
many other Obligations to that Noble Family.</p>
            <q>Men, Brethren and Fathers; Friends, Countrymen,
and Strangers,
<p>IT may be expected that I ſhould now ſay ſome great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto you,<note place="margin">Col. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Paper.</note> but the Rigour of the Seaſon, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irmities of my Age, encreaſed by a cloſe Impriſonment of
above 5 Months, doth not permit me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62930:72"/>
Moreover, we live in an Age that maketh Truth paſs for
Treaſon: I dare not ſay any Thing contrary unto it, and the
Ears of thoſe that are about me, will probably be found too
tender to hear it. My Tryal and Condemnation doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
evidence this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weſt, Rumſey</hi> and <hi>Keyling,</hi> who were brought to prove the Plot, ſaid no more of me, than that they knew me not; And ſome others equally known unto me, had uſed my Name, and
that of ſome others, to give a little Reputation unto their
Deſigns. The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is too infamous by his Life, and
the many Perjuries not to be denied, or rather ſworn by
himſelf, to deſerve mention; and being a ſingle Witneſs,
would be of no Value, though he had been of an unblemiſh'd
Credit, or had not ſeen and confeſſed, that the Crimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by him, would be pardoned only for committing more;
and even the Pardon promiſed, could not be obtained till the
Drudgery of Swearing was over.</p>
               <p>This being laid aſide, the whole Matter is reduc'd to the Papers ſaid to be found in my Cloſet by the King's Officers, without any other Proof of their being written by me, than what
is taken from the Suppoſitions upon the Similitude of an Hand
that is eaſily counterfeited, and which hath been lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the Lady <hi>Car</hi>'s Caſe, to be no lawful Evidence in
Criminal Cauſes.</p>
               <p>But, if I had been ſeen to write them, the Matter would not be much altered: They plainly appear to relate unto a large Treatiſe written long ſince, in Anſwer to <hi>Filmer</hi>'s Book,
which, by all intelligent Men, is thought to be grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wicked Principles, equally pernicious unto Magiſtrates and
People.</p>
               <p>If he might publiſh unto the World his Opinion, That all Men are born under a Neceſſity, derived from the Laws of God and Nature, to ſubmit unto an Abſolute Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which could be reſtrained by no Law or Oath; and that
he that hath the Power, whether he came unto it by Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Election, Inheritance, Uſurpation, or any other Way had
the Right, none muſt oppoſe his Will, but the Perſons and
Eſtates of his Subjects muſt be indiſpenſibly ſubject unto it. I
know not, why I might not have publiſhed my Opinion
to the Contrary, without the Breach of any Law I have yet
known.</p>
               <p>I might as freely as he, publickly have declared my Thoughts, and the Reaſons upon which they were grounded, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to believe, That God had left Nations unto the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of ſetting up ſuch Governments as beſt pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>That Magiſtrates were ſet up for the good of Nations, not Nations for the Honour or Glory of the Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:62930:72"/>
That the Right and Power of Magiſtrates in every Country,
was that which the Laws of that Country made it to be.</p>
               <p>That thoſe Laws were to be obſerved, and the Oaths taken by them, having the Force of a Contract between Magiſtrate and People, could not be violated without danger of diſſolving
the whole Fabrick.</p>
               <p>That Uſurpation could give no Right, and the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of all Enemies to Kings were they, who raiſing their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to an exorbitant Height, allowed unto Uſurpers all the
Rights belonging unto it.</p>
               <p>That ſuch Uſurpations being ſeldom compaſſed without the Slaughter of the Reigning Perſon or Family, the worſt of all Villanies was thereby rewarded with the moſt glorious Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</p>
               <p>That if ſuch Doctrines were received, they would ſtir up Men to the Deſtruction of Princes with more Violence, than all the Paſſions that have hitherto raged in the Hearts of the
moſt Unruly.</p>
               <p>That none could be ſafe, if ſuch a Reward were propoſed unto any that could deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>That few would be ſo gentle as to ſpare even the Beſt, if, by their Deſtruction, one, of a wild Uſurper, could become God's Anointed; and by the moſt execrable Wickedneſs inveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with that Divine Character.</p>
               <p>This is the Scope of the whole Treatiſe; the Writer gives ſuch Reaſon as at preſent did occur unto him to prove it. This ſeems to agree with the Doctrines of the moſt Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Authors of all Times, Nations and Religions. The beſt
and wiſeſt Kings have ever acknowledged it. The preſent King
of <hi>France</hi> hath declared, That Kings have that happy Want
of Power, that they can do nothing contrary unto the Laws of
their Country, and grounds his Quarrel with the King of <hi>Spain,
Anno</hi> 1667, upon that Principle. King <hi>James</hi> in his Speech
to the Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603, doth in the higheſt Degree aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
it: The Scriptures ſeems to declare it. If nevertheleſs
the Writer was miſtaken, he might have been refuted by Law,
Reaſon and Scripture; and no Man for ſuch Matters was ever
otherwiſe puniſhed, than by being made to ſee his Error; and
it hath not (as I think) been known, that they had been refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Judgment of a Jury, compoſed of Men utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to comprehend them.</p>
               <p>But there was little of this in my Caſe; the Extravagance of my Proſecutors goes higher: The above-mentioned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe was never finiſhed, nor could be in many Years, and moſt
probably would never have been. So much as is of it, was
written long ſince, never reviewed nor ſhewed unto any Man;
And not the Fiftieth Part of it was produced, and not the
Tenth of that afforded to be read. That which was never
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62930:73"/>
known unto thoſe who are ſaid to have conſpired with me, was
ſaid to be intended to ſtir up the People, in Proſecution of the
Deſigns of thoſe Conſpirators.</p>
               <p>When nothing of particular Application unto Time, Place, or Perſon, could be found in it, (as hath ever been done by thoſe who endeavoured to raiſe Inſurrections) all was ſupplied
by <hi>Innuendo</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever is ſaid of the Expulſion of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection againſt <hi>Nero;</hi> the Slaughter of <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi>
the Tranſlation of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
his Race unto <hi>Pepin,</hi> and from his Deſcendants unto
<hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and the like, are applied by <hi>Innuendo</hi> unto the
King.</p>
               <p>They have not conſidered, that if ſuch Acts of State be not good, there is not a King in the World that has any Title to that Crown he wears, nor can have any, unleſs he could
deduce his Pedigree from the eldeſt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſhew that
the Succeſſion had ſtill continued in the Eldeſt. of the eldeſt
Line, and been ſo deduced to him.</p>
               <p>Every one may ſee what Advantage this would be to all the Kings of the World; and whether that failing, it were not better for them to acknowledge they had received their
Crown by the Conſent of willing Nations; or to have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Title unto them than Uſurpation and Violence, which by
the ſame Ways may be taken from them.</p>
               <p>But I was long ſince told, that I muſt die, or the Plot muſt die.</p>
               <p>Leſt the Means of deſtroying the beſt Proteſtants in <hi>England</hi>
ſhould fail, the Bench muſt be filled with ſuch as had been Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes
to the Bar.</p>
               <p>None but ſuch as theſe would have adviſed with the King's Counſel, of the Means of bringing a Man to Death; ſuffered a Jury to be packed by the King's Sollicitors, and the Under-Sheriff;
Admit of Jury-men, who are not Free-holders; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſuch Evidence as is above-mentioned; Refuſe a Copy of
an Indictment, or to ſuffer the Stat. of 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. to be read, that
doth expreſly Enact, it ſhould in no Caſe be denied unto any
Man upon any Occaſion whatſoever; over-rule the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Points of Law without hearing. And whereas the
Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. upon which they ſaid I ſhould be tryed,
doth reſerve unto the Parliament all Conſtructions to be
made in Points of Treaſon; They could aſſume unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
not only a Power to make Conſtructions, but ſuch
Conſtructions as neither agree with Law, Reaſon, or common
Senſe.</p>
               <p>By theſe Means I am brought to this Place. The Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give theſe Practices, and avert the Evils that threaten the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them. The Lord ſanctifie theſe my Sufferings unto
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62930:73"/>
me; and tho' I fall as a Sacrifice unto Idols, ſuffer not Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llatry
to be eſtabliſhed in this Land. Bleſs thy People and
ſay them. Defend thine own Cauſe, and defend thoſe that
defend it. Stir up ſuch as are faint: Direct thoſe that are
willing: Confirm thoſe that waver: Give Wiſdom and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
unto all. Order all things ſo as may moſt redound to
to thine own Glory, Grant that I may die glorifying thee for all
thy Mercies; And that at the laſt thou haſt permitted me
to be ſingled out as a Witneſs of thy Truth; and even by
the Confeſſion of my Oppoſers, for that <hi>OLD CAVSE</hi> in
which I was from my Youth engaged, and for which thou
haſt often and wonderfully declared thy ſelf.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding all theſe Points gained, there was ſomething to be done before it could be be ſaid, That the King was a Deſpotical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For tho' the City of <hi>London</hi> was now abſolutely dependant
upon his Majeſty, in reſpect of the Magiſtracy thereof, and
that the naming of the other Sheriffs of all the Countles and
Shires of the Kingdom belonged unto him, yet there were
many other Cities in <hi>England,</hi> who ſtill choſe their own Sheriffs;
but ſomething muſt have been done with theſe, before the
Conſtitution of the Parliament could be ſubverted; which
ſeemed to be the only White in the Butt they had been aiming
at all this while: For you are to note, that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
conſiſts of 513 Members, whereof but 92 only are Knights
of the Shires, ſo that near 5 Parts in 6 are Burgeſſes, Citizens,
and Barons of the Cinque-Ports; and the generality of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
which ſend theſe Members, are poor decay'd Places,
and ſo not in a Condition as the City of <hi>London</hi> was, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
their Charters, or if they ſhould, there were but little
hopes to keep them, now <hi>London</hi> had not been able to hold
hers. Yet it was conſidered alſo, that it would coſt the Court-Agents
a great deal of time to bring <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
200 Corporations; wherefore all Hands were ſet on
work to induce theſe poor Inhabitants to ſurrender up their
Rights; and mighty Rewards propoſed unto thoſe who ſhould
ſhew themſelves forward and inſtrumental therein. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Moneys were ſcarce, there were Bargains made wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
Multitudes of them, to have Grants of Fairs for the Surrender
of their Charters; and thoſe who refuſed, muſt have <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi>'s
brought againſt them. However, before theſe things
were fully put in Execution, it was thought neceſſary to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the ſtanding Forces in <hi>England,</hi> who were already too
many in time of Peace; For ſome Umbrages were taken, that
Diſturbances might ariſe, before they could be brought to
Perfection. For tho' the Duke had ſecur'd <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had
20000 Foot, and 2000 Horſe, and a Years Pay, to be aſſiſting
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62930:74"/>
upon all Occaſions, and that greater Liberty than ever was
given to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> yet all this was not thought enough; and
therefore <hi>Tangier,</hi> part of Queen <hi>Catherine</hi>'s hopeful Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which coſt the King, her Husband, above 100000 <hi>l.</hi> a
Year the keeping, for 20 Years together, muſt now at laſt,
the Mould was near finiſhed, be utterly demoliſhed, and the
Garriſon brought over, which had been a Nurſery of Popiſh
Officers and Soldiers, and quartered in the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parts of the Kingdom. And in this pittiful State, we
ſhall leave <hi>England,</hi> and ſee what mighty Changes have
been made in the Face of Things in other Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and more particularly in the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where
brake out the cruelleſt War between the Emperor and the
<hi>Turks,</hi> and that has been intermixt with ſuch Variety of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Fortune in the long Courſe of it, as I think no Age nor
Hiſtory can parallel, the exact Particulars whereof we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to give, as they ſhall fall out in due Series of Time,
and their proper Order.</p>
            <p>But before we enter immediately upon that mighty Affair, it will be neceſſary to premiſe ſomewhat in this place, how things ſtood on this ſide the Empire towards <hi>France,</hi> and in
the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> We have ſaid ſomething before concerning
the Re-unions pretended to be made by <hi>France</hi> after the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Nimeguen:</hi> But yet to be a little more particular; It
was not long after the Concluſion of the ſaid Peace, that that
Crown poſſeſſed her ſelf of <hi>Homhurg</hi> and <hi>Biſſtel,</hi> the only two
Places remaining to the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> of all his Dutchy.
However, tho' the Duke, who had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut little Power of his own,
was forced tamely to ſubmit to it, yet it could not be thought
that others would be ſo willing to do it: And therefore, Firſt,
Monſieur <hi>Ravaux,</hi> who had ſearched all the Monuments of the
Parliaments of <hi>Metz,</hi> and the Cities thereabouts, endeavoured
from thence to prove; That in time of old, all <hi>Alſatia, Lorain,</hi>
the Counties of <hi>Chiney, Arlon, Vierton, St. Armand,</hi> all the
Country of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> except the City of that Name, divers
Villages and Seigniories in <hi>Germany, Flanders, Brabant, Hege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now,</hi>
and the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> did really and of juſt Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the King of <hi>France,</hi> as Dependences upon the three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks
of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> or upon other Places that
had been yielded to them by the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen.</hi> In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance
hereof they erected in <hi>France</hi> 2 Tribunals of Juſtice,
or Sovereign Courts, one at <hi>Metz,</hi> and the other at <hi>Briſac,</hi> by
the Name of <hi>The Chambers of Re-unions,</hi> where the Inhabitants
and Lords of all the fore-mentioned Places were gravely cited
to appear before the Commiſſioners; Judges, and Parties, to
ſee themſelves condemned to make their Submiſſion to the
<hi>French</hi> King, and to receive his Orders thereupon; and in caſe
of Refuſal, to be condemned for Default and Contumacy. It
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62930:74"/>
was under ſuch Pretenſions that <hi>Strasburg</hi> was ſeized on by
that Crown; and by the ſame pretended Reaſons <hi>Luxemburg</hi>
had been blocked up in a manner ever ſince the Peace, and that
as it were by way of Repriſal, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not
yield up to them ſeveral Places in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which they laid
claim to. Which way of Procedure did at length, alarm all
the Potentates upon the Continent, ſo that the Emperor, <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the States of <hi>Holland, Franconia,</hi> and ſeveral other Free
and Imperial Cities, entred into a mutual League of Defence,
which was called,<note place="margin">The League of <hi>Ausburg.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The League of</hi> Ausburg; and to the Glory of
the then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> it muſt be ſaid, and is what his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
have own'd, he was the greateſt Inſtrument to bring it
about of any in <hi>Europe.</hi> Good God! What ſhall we think of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
all this while? But I have told you already, our King had
other Fiſh to fry; and 'tis very remarkable, that he was by this
time fallen into ſuch an abject State, in the Opinion of all the
Neighbouring Princes and States, that it does not appear they
ever ſought as much as his Concurrence in, or Approbation of
this League; though otherwiſe, (generally ſpeaking) <hi>England</hi>
was the only Kingdom that was wont to keep the Scales even
between the contending Parties for many Ages together.<note place="margin">The Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the <hi>French</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Turks</hi> invading <hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </note> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
whether it were out of the Apprehenſions of the impending
Storm upon <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> from the Mahometan Quarters, or out
of a meer Act of Generoſity, this is certain, that as ſoon as the
<hi>French</hi> King came to know that the <hi>Turk</hi> was bending all his
Forces againſt the Empire, and to that End had ordered his
Army to march towards <hi>Belgrade,</hi> not only with a Deſign to
poſſeſs himſelf of all <hi>Hungary,</hi> but even to invade the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Provinces; he withdrew his Forces from before <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
though almoſt ready to ſurrender. But how conſiſtent
this Action was to the Correſpondence held by Monſieur <hi>de
Vernay,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter in <hi>Poland,</hi> with Count <hi>Tekely,</hi> or
with the Frontiers of <hi>Germany</hi>'s being thwack'd now with Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
I will not take upon me to determine; though I know
they have by others been ſufficiently cenſured. However, to
return to what I have digreſſed from: You are to note, That
the Emperor had been, for ſome Years paſt, plagued with a
diſcontented Party in <hi>Hungary,</hi> of whom Count <hi>Tekely,</hi> at laſt,
after the cutting off of <hi>Serini</hi> and others, became ſole Head.
There had been divers Expedients propoſed to accommodate
Matters between them, which proved in the End ſo ineffectual,
that nothing would ſerve the Malecontents, but calling in the
<hi>Turk,</hi> the common Enemy of Chriſtianity; which the Emperor
was not ſo little aware of,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror prepares againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </note> but he made all the Preparations his
then Circumſtances would admit of to oppoſe him; not only
by muſtering up what Force he could of his own in the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary,
Countries, and inducing ſeveral Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to concern themſelves in the Quarrel, but by making a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62930:75"/>
ſtrict Alliance with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and endeavouring
to bring the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> into the Confederacy:

            <p>On the 6th of <hi>May</hi> the Emperor gave the Command of his Army to <hi>Charles,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> at a General Rendezvous near <hi>Presburg,</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Kitzen,</hi> from whence the Duke
marched towards <hi>Raab,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Gran,</hi> where, after
he had viewed the Place, he judged the Siege very unadviſable
at that time, for Reaſons where with the Emperor remained

               </gap>atisfied, who thereupon gave the Duke Orders to attempt
ſomething elſe that might give Reputation to the Army, which
had been brought ſo early into the Field.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Newheuſel</hi> beſieged by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts.</note> This made the Duke,
with the Advice of the other Generals, reſolve upon the Siege
of <hi>Newheuſel,</hi> againſt which the Attack was carried on with
ſuch Fury and Succeſs, that the Imperialiſts quickly made
themſelves Maſters of part of the Suburbs, and of a certain
Building, that had been formerly made uſe of for a Church,
into which Count <hi>Staremberg</hi> having ordered 50 Men and a
Lieutenant, and Count <hi>Herberſtein,</hi> by a fatal Miſtake, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up with him 150 more, they filled the Church ſo very full,
that they had not room to turn themſelves in it, much leſs make
uſe of their Arms; ſo that being forced, for their Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to break down the Benches, it occaſioned ſuch a Noiſe and
Confuſion, that ſome of the Imperialiſts that were coming up
to relieve the Party, believing the Enemy to be there, fited
ſeveral times upon them, and did ſome Execution before they
perceived their Error. However, the Siege went on till the
Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> being informed, that the Grand Viſier was
coming to <hi>Buda</hi> with a very numerous Army,<note place="margin">The Siege raiſed.</note> he reſolved to
abandon it, and ſo to poſt his Troops, as to endeavour to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Emperor's Territories, which were menaced with a
dreadful Invaſion; to which end he marched back towards <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morra;</hi>
and, upon receiving further Intelligence of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> he haſted through the Iſle of <hi>Schut</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Raab,</hi> having the <hi>Danube</hi> on the Left Hand, and gave all

This put the People into the terrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was now, as it were, hemm'd in between the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi>
which made the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> by the Advice of his Officers,
reſolve upon a Retreat; and to make the ſame as ſafe as he
could, he reſolved to ſeparate the Foot and Artillery from the
Horſe, ordering the former to be carried over to the Iſle of
<hi>Shutt,</hi> through which they might ſafely march to <hi>Vienna,</hi> as
they did by the Way of <hi>Presburg</hi> and <hi>Thebe</hi> on the other ſide of

And ſo the Army got ſafe to the Plains of <hi>Kitzen,</hi> where the
general Rendezvous had been held about 20 Months before,
and from whence, underſtanding that the Grand Viſier ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
towards him, as ſuppoſing the Duke's Retreat to be a

it ſo happened that a Body of <hi>Tartars</hi> mixt with <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi>
Guides, to the Number in all of 3000, having ſwam
the River <hi>Leitha,</hi> ſallied out of a little adjacent Wood, and with
an horrible Cry, fell ſo upon ſome part of the Duke's Left
Wing, which followed the Baggage at the Head of the Army,
that they forced them to retreat in much Diſorder, and by it
put the Ranks behind them into Confuſion, which gave the

               </note> upon the Intelligence brought him by Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> of the Poſture of Things, withdrew from <hi>Vienna</hi> unto <hi>Lintz;</hi> which, together with the Waggons and Baggage of the
Army coming in an ungovern'd and diſorderly Manner under
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62930:76"/>
the Walls of the Town, did ſo terrifie the Inhabitants, that
no Man was willing to ſtay behind; all the Horſes, Waggons
and Carts that could be found were immediately hired, and
the Waggons and Carriages filled with all ſorts of Perſons, who
could take away with them only what was moſt valuable, an
took up the leaſt room: And in ſhort, nothing but Cries and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
were to be heard in every Place, as if the <hi>Turks</hi>
had been already Maſters of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and this laſted all that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon.
But while theſe Things were in Agitation, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
from <hi>Vienna</hi> the Village of <hi>Viſhamund,</hi> where the Duke
was encamp'd <hi>July</hi> 7. and another little Place hard by it, all
on a Fire, which ſtill doubled the Conſternation of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants;
ſo that as many as remained behind upon the Emperor's
going away, looked upon themſelves now as quite undone.
However, this Fear blew over again, by the News that ſoon
after came, that the foreſaid Places were not fired by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but by the Carleſsneſs of the Suttlers and others that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Camp; and at laſt they grew pretty ſecure, when
they ſaw the Duke of <hi>Lorain, July</hi> 8. with Drums beating and
Trumpets ſounding, come in good Order with his whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
by the Walls of the Town, and paſſing the Bridge over
a Branch of the <hi>Danube,</hi> about half a Mile above <hi>Vienna,</hi> which
forms an Iſland there, and where the Duke poſted himſelf with
his Cavalry. But he was no ſooner lodged there, than that
the very next Day a great Conflagration was ſeen both far and
near, all being in Flames, eſpecially towards the Frontiers of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> where not only all manner of Edifices, but even the
Fruits and Product of the Earth, were conſumed with Fire:
Neither did the Province of <hi>Auſtria</hi> it ſelf fare better, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
laid deſolate as far as <hi>Newſtadt,</hi> beſide the bloody Carnage
made of the innocent Inhabitants; and all this by the barbarous
<hi>Tartars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things being in this Poſture without, and the Enemy ſtill approaching, all Hands were ſet on work to put the Town in a Poſture of Defence, by clearing the Ditches, erecting Palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
upon the Counterſcarp, and every Body appeared very
active in the Matter, and ſo much the more, ſince Count <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg,</hi>
who had ſome Days before left the Foot and Artillery,
marching ſlowly towards <hi>Vienna,</hi> took the Appearance of ſome
Troops upon the Hill of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> not for his own Men, but
for the Forlorn of the Enemy's Army, ſent before to make way
for the main Body to form a Siege, as they were in reality;
which put him alſo upon making further Preparations of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
by ſetting the Suburbs on fire; tho' that could not give
the Inhabitants that Satisfaction as the Approach of their
Foot did, who, <hi>July</hi> 13. and the Day following came up, as did
alſo ſeveral Bodies of the Enemy, with this difference, that the
<hi>Turks</hi> encamped between the Town and the South-ſide of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62930:76"/>
               <hi>Danube,</hi> whereas the Imperial Foot marched on the other ſide
of the River, without Reſiſtance, and through the Iſland of
St. <hi>Leopold,</hi> entered <hi>Vienna</hi> about Midnight, to the inſpeakable
Joy of the Inhabitants; and as many of them as were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
were diſtributed by Count <hi>Staremberg</hi> the Governour, to
their ſeveral Poſts, there being before not above 2000 Men in
the Place.<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> form the Siege of <hi>Vienna.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>Turks</hi> poſted themſelves about the City on
the 14th, in the Form of an Half-Moon; and 2 Days after,
when they had made their Trenches at leaſt 2 Yards deep, to
ſecure themſelves from the Shot of the Beſieged, they began to
throw in their Bombs, tho' with little Succeſs: However, they
continued to advance their Works and Trenches towards the
Court and lebel Baſtions, and even by the 16th had got almoſt
within 30 Paces of the Ditch, notwithſtanding the continual
firing made upon them from within. They raiſed at firſt
3 Batteries towards the Baſtion aforementioned; which, in a
little time, they reduced into one great one, from whence
they played with great Fury, as they did alſo with their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars;
So that on the 10th a great Bomb falling upon the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Ambaſſador's Lodging, deſtroyed all the Noblemens Stables
that were built under that part of the Rampart where it fell,
but the Fire at length by the Governour's Care was put out;
And to prevent as much as might be, ſuch a Conflagration for
the future, all the Roofs of Houſes that were of Wood, were
ordered to be pulled down; the Governour in his own Perſon
giving Example of his Obedience thereunto. And becauſe
they perceived the Enemy carrying on double Lines of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
for the joyning of their Trenches, the Governour
ordered a Sally to be made under Count <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Staremberg,</hi>
which was executed with that Succeſs, that many of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Miners were killed or taken, and amongſt the reſt one who
gave the Governour Miſinformation of many Things relating
to the Enemies Camp; However, he was mightily concerned
about giving the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> Intelligence of the State of
Things, and to that End promiſed publickly an 100 Ducats to
any one that would undertake to carry a Letter over the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube</hi>
to him; But there was none found that would adventure
it at that time, tho' the Duke had better Succeſs on his part
in a Thing of the ſame kind; For on the 21ſt a Meſſenger ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from him ſafe in the Town, by ſwimming over the Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and eſcaping all the Sentinels of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that were upon the Shoar. The Letters which he brought,
were faſtned to a Bladder, and hung about his Neck, wherein
the Duke encouraged the Beſieged to be of good Cheer; for
that the Enemy would be ſhortly forced by a pitch'd Battel to
raiſe the Siege, great Succours being expected from the Empire
and Hereditary Countries, as alſo from the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who
was on his March, and already advanced as far as <hi>Olmutz.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:62930:77"/>
But all this while the <hi>Turks</hi> were not idle; for after they had
poſſeſſed themſelves of the Iſland of St. <hi>Leopold,</hi> they terribly
battered the Town from thence,<note place="margin">A Journal of the Siege, from the Beginning to the End.</note> and did great Damage, and
carried on their Deſigns with great Caution and Secreſie. But
on the 22d there were Letters brought to the Governour from
<hi>Chriſtopher Caunitz,</hi> the Emperor's Reſident at the Port, and
who was now detained in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp, that gave him
ſome Information of Things (tho' this Correſpondence quickly
ceaſed) for the Thing was ſo generally talked of in Town, that
the Grand Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ier came to hear it, and ſo took care to ſecure the
Meſſenger that went back with the Governour's Anſwer, (who,
however cunningly dropp'd the Letters that were covered with
a Ball of black Wax by the Way) ſo that the very next Day
every Family was ordered to provide a Man to watch in their
Cellars, and to give notice of any Noiſe of digging they ſhould
hear; But the Enemy ſprung 2 Mines that ſame Evening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the outward Angle of the Counterſcarp, tho' without
any conſiderable Effect. On the 25th, the <hi>Turks</hi> towards E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
began to keep Holy-day, with an hideous Noiſe of Bells
and Pipes, their ordinary Muſick, which, when ſome of the
Chriſtians heard from the Place where they kept Guard, upon
the Edge of the Ditch, which was not 10 Foot diſtant, they
invited the <hi>Turks</hi> to dance with them, that ſo the Muſick might
not be loſt, but they had quickly other Sport; For the <hi>Turks</hi>
ſprung a Mine under the Palliſadoes, which blew up many of
themſelves as well as the Chriſtians; tho' the Enemy attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereupon to enter into the Ditch, by the Breach, their
Mine had made; which occaſioned a ſmart Encounter, with
conſiderable Loſs on both ſides: And, amongſt others hurt
this Day, the Governour himſelf received a Wound in
the Hand. But it unfortunately happened the Day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Meſſenger which the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> ſent with
Letters to the City, as he was going back the ſame Way
with an Anſwer in Cypher, was intercepted by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
of which they gave the Beſieged notice, by tying the
ſaid Letters to an Arrow, and ſhooting the ſame into the
Town, with the Addition of the following Words; <hi>That it was
in vain for them to endeavour to ſend Letters to their Army, the
miſerable State of</hi> Vienna <hi>being ſufficiently known to all the World;
which was but a juſt Judgment of God Almighty, in puniſhing the</hi>
Chriſtians <hi>for the Breach of their Faith; whereby they had provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the Emperor of the</hi> Turks <hi>to that Expedition.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi>
continued their Approaches for the following Days towards
the Counterſcarp, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſtill defended themſelves
by all proper Methods; and, amongſt others, they ſprung a
Mine, <hi>July</hi> 30. in the Enemies Trenches, with very good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and obliged them to ſpend a good part of the next Day
in making good their Trenches, and the Remainder in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62930:77"/>
on their Mines; which they did ſo far towards the Ditch,
that they and the <hi>Germans</hi> could not only talk together, but
they fell foul upon one another with pieces of Sticks and Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fadoes;
till at laſt, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> taking up the Iron Hooks,
which they made uſe of in their Works, and hooking in the
<hi>Turks,</hi> drew them within their Trenches; or elſe, fixing Sythes
to long Poles, ſtruck at the Enemy through the Palliſadoes,
and killed all they could reach with them; but that did not
hinder the Beſiegers to ply the Town with Bombs; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo,: but to carry on their Trenches with great Diligence;
whilſt the <hi>Germans</hi> endeavoured in vain, with their Bombs and
Granadoes, to diſturb them: It was their Practice, as ſoon as
they had made their Trenches, to cover them immediately
with great Pieces of Wood, over which they laid Boards, and
Bags of Sand; where they ſecured themſelves ſo well from the
Shot of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ha's, and even the Grand
Viſier himſelf, taking theſe Trenches for their ſafe Retreat,
ordered them to be made very large and ſpacious, and to
be divided with ſeveral Appartments, which they paved
with Tyles, and furniſhed with Tapeſtry; where nothing
was wanting that was neceſſary for the Convenience of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>It was now <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. when the Enemy, in the Night, threw up the Earth from the Trenches at leaſt 3 Yards higher than the Places where the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> kept Guard, endeavouring
from thence to burn the Palliſadoes; But the Men that defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them oppoſed the Enemy with great Courage, and beat
them back, while others fetch'd Water from the Bottom of the
Ditch, and put out the Fire: Tho' this was not effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Loſs of a great many Men on both ſides, but of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the <hi>Turks</hi> the next Day, by ſpringing a Mine which the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> had carried from the Lebel Baſtion, to their very
Works, and which blew up a great many of them: To which
was added ſoon after, the Burning of the Boats the <hi>Turks</hi> had
brought together at the Iſland of St. <hi>Leopold,</hi> by a Party of
<hi>Germans</hi> that ſallied out of the Town; whom the Governour
generouſly rewarded for ſo fortunate an Undertaking. But
the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſo far from being diſcouraged herewith, that
on <hi>Aug.</hi> 3. at Night they attacked the Counterſcarp, having
for that End thrown up Earth for many Days over the Palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,
whereby they got above the <hi>Germans,</hi> and from thence
fought Hand to Hand againſt them, with Guns, Scimeters and
Javelins; the Infidels baſely ſhooting vaſt Numbers of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
Arrows againſt the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> However, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
ſtood ſtoutly to it ſtill, and maintained their Poſts: And the
<hi>Turks,</hi> on the other ſide, were alſo as obſtinate; for, after the
firſt Attack, they ſprung a Mine upon the outward Angle of
the Counterſcarp, which broke the Earth thereabout, near the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62930:78"/>
Paliſadoes; from which, tho' the <hi>Germans</hi> retreated a little at
firſt, yet ſome of them ventured preſently after to fix them up
anew, while others drove away the <hi>Turks</hi> from the Poſts they
had gained. They continued ſtill firing, both from their
Guns and Mortars, with wonderful Fury the ſucceeding Days;
by which, and throwing Hand-Granadoes, they were enabled,
notwithſtanding all the Endeavours of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to the
Contrary, to throw up ſo much Earth upon the Counterſcarp,
that, carrying it before them, they filled the Ditch of the
Ravelin, in order to make their Aſſault the more eaſie: But
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> withſtood them with all imaginable Courage;
and the Governour himſelf was almoſt every where preſent;
encouraging the Soldiers, and calling them Brothers: And
<hi>Aug.</hi> 6. at 4 in the Morning, he ordered a little Bed to be
brought to the Place where the Emperor's Guards uſed to
lodge, that he might be nearer at hand on all Occaſions. But,
tho' the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was able to beat <hi>Teckely,</hi> who was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaging
<hi>Moravia,</hi> near the River <hi>Marow,</hi> and to force him to
retreat to his former Station upon the <hi>Waag,</hi> he was not then
in a Condition to relieve the Town; and ſo the Siege was
preſs'd on; And <hi>Aug.</hi> 7. at Night, there was a ſharp Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
between the Beſieged and the Enemy, who keeping the
high Ground, were expoſed on all ſides to the Shot of the
<hi>German</hi> Out-guards, who were lodged upon a Level with
them, upon the Side of the Ditch: Whereupon, they threw
up a great deal of Earth, in order to ſecure themſelves, and
then began to fill up the Ditch with the Earth, to make it even
with the Counterſcarp and the Ravelin, to facilitate their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack:
And, tho' the <hi>Germans</hi> endeavoured with all Privacy to
wheel away the Earth, the <hi>Turks</hi> diſcovered them; and ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of their Trenches and Galleries towards the Lebel Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
they drove away the Beſieged with a conſiderable Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and all the Day following continued their Works with
great Diligence, carrying on their Mine to the very Ditch of
the Ravelin; which the <hi>Germans</hi> obſerving, and fearing they
would attack the Ravelin, they drew off their great Guns from
thence, and planted them upon the Walls of the Town, but
left ſome Men upon the Ravelin, to annoy the Enemy with
Small-ſhot: That Night Count <hi>Daune</hi> and Count <hi>Souches,</hi> by
Direction from the Governour (who was then ſick) made a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Sally with 300 Men, and ſucceeded ſo well, that they
ſet fire to the Enemies Galleries, by which they made their
Paſſage into the Bottom of the Ditch, but they returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to their Galleries, repaired the Damage, and next Day
ſprung a Mine in the Ditch of the Ravelin, which did the
Beſieged's Works conſiderable Damage. For the further Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of this Siege, from hence to <hi>Aug.</hi> 19. I think they
cannot be better given you, than by Count <hi>Staremberg</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     <p>GOD be thanked,<note place="margin">Count <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg</hi>'s Letter to the Duke of <hi>Lorain.</hi>
                        </note> one of my Letters has had the good Fortune to come to your Highneſs's Hands: You would have received many more ſince the 22d paſt, had I found Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
fit to carry them, in which many have miſcarried; and
it will not be my Fault, if your Highneſs be not oftner and
better informed for the future, that your Highneſs may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
know our Condition. I will firſt tell you, that hitherto
we have diſputed every Foot of Ground with the Enemy;
and what they have gained, they have paid dear for, having,
as often as they attempted to lodge themſelves, been very
vigorouſly repulſed by us with our Swords in our Hands, with
ſo great Loſs on their ſide, that they now hardly dare ſhew
themſelves out of the Holes and Hills, with which they have
ſurrounded their Attack of the Counterſcarp. Your Highneſs
underſtood by my laſt, that the Enemy had made a Deſcent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
into the Ditch of the Ravelin, and that they blew up part of
the Wall; whereas they did then ſo, ſo have they ſeveral
times ſince made an Aſſault, but, God be thanked, without
Succeſs. We have likewiſe ſeveral times beaten them from
the Poſt they had taken at the Foot of the Breach; but as
ſoon as our Men retired, they returned thither again. I have
thereupon uſed what Precaution I could, and have cauſed Pits
to be made in the Point of the Ravelin, and done whatever
elſe might moſt annoy the Enemy. I have done the like in
the Baſtions they attack, where they have yet attained no
Ground, remaining ſtill on the Edge of the Counterſcarp.
The 14th they made a Deſcent thro' the Ditch before the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
called <hi>Lebel,</hi> and the ſame Night they made another
great Lodgment in the Ditch; whereupon perceiving that we
could not much incommode them there, neither with our
Great nor Small Shot, becauſe they lay too low in the Ground;
I employed our Cannon againſt their Works, and ſecured
our Paſſage into the Ditch, and attacking them 3 ſeveral times,
we beat them from thence. In the firſt Attack our Men were
not ſtrong enough to ruine their Works, but the Wind being
favourable, burnt their Gabeons, and almoſt all their Gallery;
and ſince that, they have not made any further Attack upon
the Ravelin on that ſide. Yeſterday they ſprung a Mine, but
without any Succeſs. We have made in the middle of the
Ravelin a good Retrenchment with a good Ditch. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
of <hi>Lebel</hi> and that of the Court have likewiſe double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments;
and I am now making a Retrenchment behind
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62930:79"/>
thoſe 2 Baſtions; ſo that your Highneſs may ſee we are not
wanting in any Thing on our part; and I aſſure you, I will
never ſurrender the Place, but with the laſt Drop of my
Blood. For the reſt, our Men do not fear the Enemy; and,
Thanks be to God, 30 or 40 of ours have always beaten and
diſlodged 100 of theirs. This Day was brought to me a Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizary
Priſoner, who, among other Things, tells me, That
they have loſt in the Attacks they have made 10000 Men, a
great many Officers and Janizaries, and the Baſſa's of <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potomia</hi>
and <hi>Albania;</hi> and that they ſeem to ſuffer very much
for want of Forage and Victuals, which they are forced to go
a great Way for, and that they are expecting a Convoy from
<hi>Macedonia.</hi> For what concerns my ſelf, I have had the Bloody
Flux theſe 8 Days, but am at preſent ſomewhat better;
however, that made me not neglect my Duty, for I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
where I could not go. Your Highneſs will comfort us
with your Preſence, and do me the Favour to believe that
I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Men, whom we received very well with our Great and
Small Shot, and in Concluſion they made an inconſiderable
Lodgement, though with the Loſs of 300 of their Men;
but this Morning I ſprung a Mine which diſlodged them,
and buried a great Number of them. I expect at this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
the like Entertainment from them; and if I can be
ready before them, I will ſpring one more to your Highneſs's

            <p>On the 20th of <hi>Aug.</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> thundered with their great Guns and Bombs upon the City Baſtions after their uſual Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as they did alſo the Day after, ſpringing a Mine withal,
which yet did no great Execution; the ſame Work continued
on both ſides till the 22th, when the Meſſenger, whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
had ſent to the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> returned with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from his Highneſs into the Town, which greatly encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Beſieged; for he ſignified to them thereby, That the
Armies were almoſt joined; That the Troops of <hi>Bavaria,
Saxony, Franconia,</hi> the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> were near <hi>Crembs;</hi>
That the King of <hi>Poland</hi> was haſtning thither in Perſon, as
was alſo the Electors of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Emperor
himſelf coming to <hi>Lintz,</hi> that he might be nearer the Army;
but that the whole Enterprize depended upon the brave De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
they ſhould make, until the Armies were joined, which
was hoped would be before the End of the Month; That in
the mean time the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> was moving towards
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62930:79"/>
               <hi>Crembs,</hi> to forward the Bridges that were making there; That
nothing was omitted that might contribute to ſo neceſſary
and honourable a Relief; and that his Highneſs was reſolved
rather to hazard all, than that the City ſhould be loſt; That
he had beaten <hi>Tekely</hi> near <hi>Presburg,</hi> and taken all his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that <hi>Presburg,</hi> which had been lately ſurrender'd
to <hi>Tekely,</hi> was now under the Emperor's Obedience; and that
he had alſo beaten the Count a ſecond time near the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
But if this Information from his Highneſs heightned
the Reſolution of the Beſieged, the <hi>Turks</hi> perſiſted as obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their Attacks, and carrying on of their Works; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by another Letter of Count <hi>Staremberg</hi> to the Duke of

                     <p>I Caſt my ſelf at your Highneſs's Feet, moſt humbly to thank you for the Goodneſs you was pleaſed to expreſs towards me in your laſt Letter. Your Highneſs knows I am perfectly
devoted to you, and that I deſire nothing more paſſionately,
than by moſt humbly Service to render my ſelf worthy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Since my laſt the Enemy have ſprung 6 or 7 Mines in
the Ravelin, which, after having repulſed them, we preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repaired again, and we ſtill maintain our Intrenchments,
the Enemy having hitherto gained no more than a Lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the Point of the Ravelin. We ſearch above and
under Ground, and have countermined 3 of the Enemies
Mines, and ſprung 2 Mines, which had good Effect; and
would have had much better, were our Miners more brave
and expert; but being People which we get together any
way, its impoſſible to make them re-enter a Mine, when they
once hear the Enemy at work in the Counterſcarp. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
have likewiſe ſprung 3 Mines near the Retrenchment
palliſadoed, which we ſtill maintain to cover the Caponers
we have in the Ditch; and though the Palliſadoes were in
ſome places beaten down by the laſt Mine, yet our Men with
their Swords in their Hands, maintained the Poſt, till ſuch
time as they were made good again, and we do ſtill keep it.
The Enemy have made again 2 Deſcents into the Ditch, the
one towards the Baſtion of <hi>Lebel,</hi> and the other towards that
of the Court, from whence our Men did in open Day, under
the favour of the Fire we made upon the Enemy 2 Hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
very bravely diſlodge them, while others, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for that Purpoſe, filled up their Works, and burnt their
Gabeons and Galleries, ſo that they muſt now begin again.
But, <hi>Sir,</hi> its time to ſuccour us, we loſe a great many Men,
and many Officers, more by the Bloody Flux than by the Fire
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62930:80"/>
of the Enemy; for there dies almoſt every Day 60 of this
Diſtemper. We have no more Granadoes, which were our
beſt Defence. Our Cannon are partly ſpoiled by the Enemy,
and partly burſt, not having endured 50 Shot, by reaſon of
the Badneſs of their Metal: And the Enemy finding they
cannot with ſmall Numbers lodge themſelves in the Ditch,
they make great Lodgments on the Counterſcarp, to keep a
great Number of Men there, and to make an extraordinary
Effort. For the reſt, it is certain, that the Enemy have
loſt, and do ſtill loſe every Day, a great many Janizaries; and
that they have many wounded; and ſick of the ſame Diſtemper
which reigns amongſt them. They have ſeveral Camps; far
enough from each other, and may be eaſily broken if they
ſtay for Your Highneſs here, which I do not believe they
will do. They are not at preſent 80000 fighting Men; and
one Camp may be beaten, before it can be aſſiſted by the
other. We expect Your Highneſs with the greateſt Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
But I do not ſo much deſire to be delivered out of this
Siege, as to have the Honour to aſſure Your Highneſs of the
Reſpect with which I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Aug.</hi> the 28th, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſprung a Mine on the Right-ſide of the attack'd Ravelin, and withal made an Aſſault, but were beaten off. Next Day they ſprung another Mine, with ſuch
Succeſs, that it utterly deſtroyed the Ravelin, ſaving a little
Retrenchment the <hi>Germans</hi> had on the middle of it, which
they ſtill maintained for ſome Days very obſtinately; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beſet on every ſide, the Governour ordered that Poſt to
be abandoned; ſo that the Enemy ſtill made their Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
when on the 1ſt of <hi>Sept.</hi> they were buſie in advancing their
Works towards the Baſtion, the <hi>Germans</hi> ſallied upon them,
and drove the <hi>Turks</hi> to the Counterſcarp, entring into their
Trenches as far as a Battery, where they nailed up 2 of their
great Guns; but the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were at laſt repulſed into the
Town, with ſome Loſs; when perceiving the Enemy intended
to carry a Mine under the Court Baſtion, and to that End had
already made their Approaches in the Bottom of the Ditch, to
the <hi>Lebel</hi> Baſtion, they threw ſeveral Rockets that Night into
the Air, as a Signal to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, that they ſtood in
great need of Relief: For, tho' the Meſſenger that had been
ſent to the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> twice before returned with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
News to the Beſieged, to the Town the next Day, he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62930:80"/>
was diſpatched away that ſame Evening to the Duke again,
to preſs him to haſten his Succours, for the Enemy had that
very Day ſprung their Mine under the Left-ſide of the Court-Baſtion
ſo ſucceſsfully, that the Garriſon were very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
leſt the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould find a Paſſage, ſo as to lodge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
within the Baſtion; and that carrying the Mine far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the whole Structure would be endamaged. On the 3d
they fully poſſeſſed themſelves of the Ravelin; and on the
4th, about 2 in the Afternoon, they ſprung another Mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Left <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace of the Court-Baſtion, which made ſo terrible a
Noiſe and Concuſſion, that half the Town was ſhaken with it, and
at leaſt .30 Foot of the Baſtion thrown down; which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſeconding with an Aſſault, and their uſual Cry of <hi>Alla, Alla,</hi>
put the whole City into the greateſt Conſternation imaginable;
but the <hi>Germans</hi> that had the Guard of that Poſt, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtopping the Breach with great Beams, and Sacks filled with
Sand and Earth, after a deſperate Fight, moſt gallantly repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Enemy; as they did alſo 1000 <hi>Turks</hi> more, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
on the Top of the Ditch, whom they forced, with
great Slaughter on both ſides, to their firſt Poſt, under the
Baſtion: Yet the Place was too open, and the Enemy ſtill too
near, and therefore the Beſieged repeated their Signal from
St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Tower, and the ſame Day ſent a Letter to the
Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> to let him once more know their Extremity,
which the Enemy was not inſenſible of, and therefore they
plied them with their heavy Cannon on the 5th of <hi>Sept.</hi> and
in the Evening they endeavoured to regain the Ground they
had loſt upon the Court-Baſtion, though without Succeſs:
But having on the 6th ſprung ſeverall Mines under the <hi>Lebel</hi>-Baſtion,
they made ſuch a Breach, that a great part of the
Baſtion, which was at leaſt 20 Foot thick, was quite thrown
down, from top to bottom, leaving a Gap of 36 Foot broad;
and the Beſieged quite uncovered: Whereupon, the Enemy
made a furious Aſſault, but by reaſon of the Difficulty of the
Paſſage, could not then prevail: However, the Night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they fell upon digging new Paſſages through the Breach;
which made the <hi>Germans</hi> once more give a Signal to the Duke
of <hi>Lorain,</hi> by Rockets, that their Circumſtances were now
ſuch as required immediate Relief; and, at the ſame time,
ſpent that Night in making what Defences they could by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſadoes,
new Batteries, and the like; which, while they were
buſying themſelves about, they ſaw 5 Rockets upon the Top of
the <hi>Calemburg,</hi> as a certain Signal that their expected Succours
were at hand; and which they readily anſwered in the ſame
Manner from the Town. Of this the Grand Viſier ſeemed
to be aware, by the general Muſter he made of his Army the
next Day, but at the ſame time continued his Works with all
manner of Diligence, as they did alſo the ſucceeding Day,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62930:81"/>
when with ſome more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lines they blew up another piece of
the Baſtion, but yet not ſo much as to give them free Paſſage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as they deſired; ſo that in the 2 Aſſaults they here made, they
were both times repulſed: And yet the ſame Night, tho' a
Priſoner gave the Beſieged an Account of the Confuſion the
<hi>Turks</hi> were in by reaſon of the approaching Succours, they
thought it convenient, for all that, to make another Signal to
the Duke, from St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Tower; and the rather, ſince the
<hi>Turks</hi> ſeemed ſtill obſtinate in carrying on their Attacks, which
they continued, with no very great Advantage, till the 11th
of <hi>Sept.</hi> when that ſame Afternoon they drew all their Forces
out of their Camp, and marched towards the <hi>Calemburg,</hi>
(which was a certain Sign to the Beſieged, that their Succours
were marching that way;) and taking the Advantage of the
Night, endeavoured to get up the Hill, whilſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> met them in the Deſcent: At that time the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
alſo had the Satisfaction to ſee the Rockets which
were thrown up on the Top of the Hill, as a Signal of
their Approach, and which they expected with ſo much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience.</p>
            <p>The next Day, which was the 12th of <hi>Sept.</hi> after Sun-riſing, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army advanced from the upper part of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemburg,</hi>
moving ſlowly, in cloſe Order, from the <hi>Carthuſian</hi>
Monaſtery, and St. <hi>Leopold</hi>'s Chappel, and extending it ſelf
more and more until they made their way out of the Foreſt,
when they cloſed their Lines, and marching towards the Plain,
left a Space for them that followed, and room for themſelves
to move in, their Cannon playing upon the Enemy at ſeveral
Intervals. But the <hi>Turks</hi> were guilty of a very great Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
in not ſecuring the Paſſages of the Wood, or other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Poſts, which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> found difficult enough
to paſs, tho' they met with no Oppoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, perhaps, the
former vainly truſted to their Numbers, having ſtill an Army
of an 120000 fighting Men, tho' they had loſt near 60000 at
the Siege, whereas the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army without, was not above
80000 and 6000 within the Town, who yet did good Service
upon this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>The Right Wing of the Army was given to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> for that he had moſt Horſe, and that the Country was open on that ſide; the Left, to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> becauſe they were ſtrongeſt in the
Foot, and that the Country was incloſed on that ſide all along
the <hi>Danube,</hi> and the main Body to the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and
Prince <hi>Waldeck;</hi> In this Diſpoſition, the Generals, that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
according to Appointment, met upon the Hill, to give
the neceſſary Orders, and were no ſooner come together, but
a Body of 10000 <hi>Turks</hi> appear'd, and advanced towards the
<hi>Chriſtians;</hi> whereupon a Battallion was ordered to poſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62930:81"/>
in a Vineyard, that was on an Hill hard by, being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by 3 other Battallions, which made the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtop: For,
not enduring the Fire of thoſe Battallions, and being all Horſe,
and in a Ground where they could not well attack the Foot,
they contented themſelves to make one Diſcharge, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with an hideous Noiſe, and ſo retired: Whereupon the
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the other Princes having obſerved the
the Diſpoſition of the Enemy, drew the Army into 3 Lines,
and cloſed without any Intervals as before mentioned, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them to march very ſlowly towards the Enemy, and to
ſtand, when the <hi>Turks</hi> came to Charge them, keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
very cloſe, and not to fire till the Enemy had made their
Diſcharge, which was exactly performed; for the Enemy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
towards them with an horrible Cry, as if they meant to
break in upon them, hoping thereby to make them give way,
or to put them into Diſorder; But finding the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſtood
firm, and expecting them in a very cloſe Order, they durſt
not puſh any further, but halted, and ſtill finding the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
did not ſtir, but ſtood expecting them, they then made their
Diſcharge, and wheeled off. Upon this, the firſt Line of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
fired, and that done, the whole Army advanced ſlowly, and
ſo gained Ground upon the Enemy, who returning, came up as
before; the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> thereupon made an Halt, and expected
them, and the <hi>Turks</hi> having made their Diſcharge, retired again,
which they repeated ſeveral times without adventuring to break
in upon the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who ſtill gained Ground, driving the <hi>Turks</hi>
before them, like a Flock of Sheep: Being come near the Enemies
Camp, a Body of Foot and Dragoons were detach'd to attack
their Cannon, which they made themſelves Maſters of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great Oppoſition; the Enemy having but a ſmall
Number of Foot to defend them, and even their Horſe made
no great Reſiſtance any where, tho' they endeavoured on the
ſide of the Right Wing to Charge the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in Flank,
which the King of <hi>Poland</hi> miſtruſting, cauſed part of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Line to advance, and make a Front on that ſide, and
charging the Enemy in Perſon with the firſt Line, made them
give way. During the hotteſt of the Battle, the <hi>Turks</hi> attackt
the Town, and put the Beſieged ſo to it, that Count <hi>Starem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
was forced to ſend to the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> for Aſſiſtance;
whereupon the Duke ſent Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> with a Body of
Horſe; Foot, and Dragoons into the City, with whoſe Help all
the <hi>Turks</hi> that were in the Attack, where cut to pieces. In
ſhort, towards Evening, the Enemy began to give way, and
fled, being purſued by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> beyond their Camp, and
there they made an Halt, the Soldiers upon pain of Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Commanded not to ſtir out of their Ranks, and the whole
Army remained all Night in Battle array, as if the Enemy had
been ſtill preſent. Next Day the Camp was Plundered, half
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62930:82"/>
a Company going out at a time, while the other half continued
at their Arms, and when they returned, theſe went out in
like manner. All the Enemies Baggage, Proviſion, Tents,
50 Pieces of Cannon, 2 Horſe-Tails, the Grand Seignior's
Standard, and the Viſier's own Horſe were taken, and moſt of
their Foot cut in pieces, being computed at about 15000, the
reſt having periſhed during the Siege; and the Victory was ſo
much the more glorious to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Arms, in, that they
loſt not above a 1000 Men in all, and very few Perſons of Note,
the Duke of <hi>Croy,</hi> and ſome others being wounded, and that
the Capital of the <hi>German</hi> Empire, was hereby relieved, which
otherwiſe muſt inevitably have fallen into the Hands of the
Infidels, in leſs than 48 Hours more, (having already endured
9 Weeks Siege,) for want of Proviſions, and a ſufficient Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
to defend it longer, their Number being diminiſhed one
half, and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Mines ready to blow up the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments
they had for its Security. And becauſe it is fit
the Memory of thoſe Great Men that appeared this Day at
the Head of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, and under whoſe Conduct
this ſignal Victory was obtained, ſhould by all juſt Means be
perpetnated to future Generations; they were theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
The King of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi>

to the Emperor, how that in 1529, when <hi>Solyman</hi> the
<hi>Magnificent</hi> came in Perſon, with an Army of 200000 Men, to
beſiege <hi>Vienna,</hi> that then, at the Prayer of the Beſieged, he
did forbear to ſhoot at St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Tower, as being a very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial

the Citizens had then, by Agreement, placed on the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of the Tower an Half Moon and a Star, which are the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Arms; and they were yet remaining in the ſame Place:
But that the <hi>Turks</hi> having now, in Violation of that Agreement,
continually fired upon that Tower, and done it much Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
the Biſhop, for that Reaſon, humbly prayed his Imperial
Majeſty, to grant him Leave to pull down the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Arms,
and to erect the Croſs inſtead of it: Which, with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
Approbation, was immediately effected. After this, the
Emperor had an Interview with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> at the
Head of his Army, in his Camp; and thanked him for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Aſſiſtance he had given him, and all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> upon
this great Occaſion: And the King having returned the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
the Emperor returned to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and ſhewed Marks
of his Favour to all the Princes and Great Men that had ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized

            <p>The <hi>Poliſh</hi> and Imperial Armles having a little refreſhed themſelves, they reſolved to purſue the Victory; and to that End, paſſing by <hi>Presburg,</hi> they advanced on the 9th of <hi>Oct.</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

Complement to the Emperor laſt Year, upon their quitting
the Blockade of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> That it was done that the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
might take no Umbrage at ſuch a Conjuncture, when the
<hi>Infidels</hi> were threatning the Empire with an Invaſion; Yet the
Year was not expired, but that, in purſuance to the ſaid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,

ſeized all the Effects belonging to the <hi>French,</hi> in their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> States were not ſo hot upon the Matter,

of the Country into the Field, as a Means to give the <hi>French</hi>

Rupture: But he was ſtill oppoſed in his Deſigns by the Artifice

Inſomuch that at laſt the City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> would not

            <p>At the ſame time that this Truce was propoſed in <hi>Holland,</hi>
there was alſo another put to the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in a manner, the ſame thing, and was accepted of by them;
the more readily, to be ſure, becauſe of the War the Empire
was now deeply engaged in with the <hi>Turks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> In both which we

                  <hi>Genoa</hi> bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barded by the <hi>French</hi> Fleet.</note>
The <hi>French</hi> Fleet arriving about the 17th of <hi>May</hi> before
that City, the Fort on the Mole ſaluted them with 11 Guns,
which was anſwered by the <hi>French</hi> Admiral with 9; when the
Fort a little after ſaluted the Admiral again with 20 Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and 10 Guns, which he returned with 7; ſo that they
ſeemed yet to be in the dark what to think of it. Next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Senate ſent 6 Deputies on Board the Admiral to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
him, and to know the occaſion of the Fleet's coming
thither (which they knew, no doubt, well enough before:)
and being returned they reported to the Senate, that Monſieur
<hi>Saignelay</hi> had told them, the King was very much diſſatisfied
with the late Conduct of the Republick, and that his Demands
of them were: That they ſhould quit the Protection of <hi>Spain;</hi>
That they ſhould join the 4 Gallies they had lately built with
thoſe of his Majeſty; That they would permit the <hi>French</hi> to
have a Magazine of Salt at <hi>Savona;</hi> That they ſhould ſend 4
Senators on Board to beg his Majeſty's Pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
reſolved not to grant theſe Demands, and therefore let
the <hi>French</hi> know, if they drew not farther off, they would look
upon them as Enemies: But they taking no notice of it, the
<hi>Genoeſe,</hi> about 3 in the Afternoon, ſhot towards the Admiral
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62930:85"/>
without Bullet, and an Hour after the ſeveral Forts fired with
Shot, which made the <hi>French</hi> Ships and Gallies draw further
off. But the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Galliots continued all in a Row to fire one
part of the City, and began to throw their Bombs into the
plate, which put the People into a very great Conſternation,
having never heard, and much leſs ſeen and felt ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thing
before, (for, I think, this Action of the <hi>French</hi> was the firſt of
Bombing any place by Sea before.) But it did not end here, and
they themſelves have ſince felt the dire Effects of it. On the
21th the Doge's Palace was quite beaten down, and the Doge
and Senate removed to the <hi>Albergho,</hi> a great Fabrick built by
the Publick, where the Bombs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not reach. The next
Morning being the 22th, the <hi>French</hi> ſent aſhoar, to let the
Senate know, That they were ſorry to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uine ſo fine a City; and
that they would yet give them 24 Hours to agree to the King's
Demands. Upon this the Great Council was called the 23th,
early in the Morning, who reſolved not to ſubmit to the <hi>French</hi>
Demands; and this Anſwer was given them at the Mole;
the People now beginning to be couragious, and with a great
Shout crying, <hi>Vive St. Georgio;</hi> whereupon the <hi>French</hi> began
again to ſhoot their Bombs into the Town, and they from the
Shoar fired upon the Fleet. The Inhabitants upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
removed moſt of their movable Effects into the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Villages; and, to quiet the Rabble, there was leave given
them to break open all the <hi>French</hi> men's Houſes and Shops,
which was ſoon done; but it had an ill Conſequence; For the
ſame Rabble began to rob and plunder what other Houſes they
pleaſed: Whereupon the Senate gave the Serjeant General of
the City leave to hang up whomſoever he ſhould find ſtealing;
which, after ſome Examples made of them, brought all things
quiet again. On the 23th at Sun-ſet the <hi>French</hi> Ships and
Gallies came very near, and ſeverely batter'd the Town for 7
Hours together, and in the mean time landed 500 Men to the
Weſtward, and another Body on the Eaſt ſide of the City; but
they were ſo warmly received, that they were forced at laſt to
return to their Gallies, excepting ſeveral they left ſlain, and
divers Priſoners behind them. But on the 24th the Sea grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
high, the <hi>French</hi> Fleet weighed off, which the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> were
not a little glad of; For, beſides the vaſt Loſs they ſuffered by
this Bombardment already, they had dreadful Apprehenſions of
being entirely ruined; which made them bethink themſelves of
giving the King Satisfaction before ſuch another Return; and
therefore, at laſt, they were conſtrained, ſore againſt their
Wills, to ſend their Doge and 4 Senators to the <hi>French</hi> Court
to make their humble Submiſſions.</p>
            <p>But while the <hi>French</hi> Monarch was thus triumphing over the little republick of <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Campaign was not in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary;</hi>

the Enemy put out a Red Flag for a Signal of Defiance, having
ſent all their Women and Children before with the beſt of their
Effects to <hi>Buda.</hi> However, the Infantry poſted themſelves
immediately under the Walls of the Town, againſt whoſe Walls
and Palliſadoes, they fired 12 pieces of Canon on the 16th all
the day long, and in the Evening ſtormed it, which the Enemy
not enduring, were forced to flee to the Caſtle and adjacent
Mountains, but they found no ſecurity there neither: For the
Caſtle was ſo Bombed next day, that about Noon they began
to Capitulate; but it happened ſo, that the Conditions could
not be agreed on that day, becauſe of a flying Report that
came from <hi>Gran,</hi> That Baron <hi>Halliwell</hi> had been worſted by
the Enemy, which made the Duke with ſome Horſe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
move that way. But upon Confuſion of Reports, he thought
fit to ſend the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> with ſome Squadrons thither,
who, upon his Arrival, found the Action already over, which
hapned briefly thus. The <hi>Turks</hi> upon their approach to <hi>Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

about Noon appeared, and ſounded an Allarm: Whereupon
General <hi>Halliwel,</hi> who was much miſtaken as to their Number,
went and poſted himſelf upon the left Hand, betwixt the two
Mountains in a ſtraight Paſs, with about 500 Horſe, and gave
at the ſame time Orders to the Lieutenant Collonel of <hi>Sax Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg,</hi>
to advance through the Paſſage, and put himſelf in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Things being thus effected, the General from an Hill,
where he had poſted his Men, found, contrary to expectation,
the Enemy much ſtronger than he had thought, drawn up in
the form of an half Moon, and advancing with a deſign to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
him, which made him think of retiring, but it proved too
late, for he was here killed, though Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Rab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

did all he could to relieve him, falling upon the Enemy with
great Fury, whom he drove back and purſued above 5 Miles
from the Place, to an advantageous Poſt, where they ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied,
and in this Action came off with a greater Loſs than the

            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Vicegrade</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> directed his March, by the Way of <hi>Gran</hi> and <hi>Barkan,</hi> towards <hi>Waiſen,</hi> ſending Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Enemy; who on <hi>Monday</hi> the 26th, brought Intelligence that
the <hi>Turks</hi> were advancing towards <hi>Waiſen,</hi> in the hollow Way:
Whereupon the Duke continued his March, and next Day ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in the Plains of <hi>Waiſen,</hi> where the Enemy being about
15000 ſtrong, appeared, drawn up in Battallia. Their right
Wing flanked with Janizaries ſtood upon the Mountain, but
their left drew towards the City, which made the Duke put
himſelf immediately into a Poſture of Defence, flanking the
Cavalry with the Infantry. This was hardly done, when the
Enemy diſcharged 5 Pieces of Cannon they had, with great
Fury ſeveral times upon the Imperialiſts right Wing, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Damage, ſo that they quitted that Station, and fell
briskly upon the left, but were ſoon beaten back in great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and Confuſion towards the right, where they were ſo
warmly plied with the <hi>German</hi> Cannon, that they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retired; the Horſe towards <hi>Peſt,</hi> and as many of the Foot as
ſaved themſelves into the City, having loſt in all about 1000,
and among them one Baſha, but with very little loſs to the
<hi>Germans;</hi> eſpecially ſince the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> eſcaped ſo well,
though ſo narrowly, for his Horſe was ſhot through the Neck,
during the Engagement. The Conſequence of this Succeſs,
was (after the firing of ſome Cannon) the Surrender of <hi>Waiſen</hi>
upon Diſcretion: From hence the Army marched towards <hi>Peſt,</hi>
after having garriſoned the other Place with 2000 Foot, 500
Curaſſiers, and 300 Dragoons. On <hi>Monday</hi> the 10th of <hi>July,</hi>
the whole Army got over the <hi>Danube,</hi> and encamped at a
Place, called St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> their Left Wing being ſecured by
the <hi>Danube,</hi> and their Right by an unacceſſible Mountain,
and right againſt them, a broad and long Marſh. But for all
this, the Enemy not only advanced towards Noon, but divided
themſelves into 2 Wings, and leaving the great Marſh in the
middle, fell with great Noiſe and Fury upon the <hi>Germans;</hi>
whoſe Cavalry thereupon a little advanced upon their Left
Wing, but were immediately ordered back, by the Duke's
Commands: In the mean time, the <hi>Turks</hi> had beaten back the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> Watch, but the Prince of <hi>Salm,</hi> who commanded
the Rear-guard, ſtoutly oppoſed them, and being reinforced
with a Battallion of Infantry, and with ſome Pieces of Cannon
from the Duke, he utterly routed, and purſued them near upon
2 Miles; when the <hi>Turks</hi> rallied again, and fell with great Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

they were again extremly gauled by the <hi>Germans</hi> Cannon;
and being forced to retire to their Right Wing, which by this

Expreſs, Count <hi>Charles de Magni,</hi> Colonel of Dragoons, to
give your Imperial Majeſty an Account of it, with all the
Circumſtances that have accompanied this great Action:
Upon the Advice we received on the 21ſt Inſtant, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to leave all the Infantry, and what Horſe was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
before <hi>Buda;</hi> and with the reſt of the Cavalry, and

Break of Day were within half a Mile of the Enemies Camp,
who might eaſily ſee and obſerve us, being very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched.
They came out of their Camp, being about 20000
ſtrong, put themſelves into Battalia, and made a ſhew for
ſome time of attacking us in our Flank, but we did our part
to hinder their Deſign, and ſo the Fight begun; and God
bleſſing your Majeſty's Arms, we put the Enemy into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;
they fled, and we followed them very cloſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Maſters of their whole Camp, (as at the Raiſing of the
Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi>) of all their Tents, Baggage, Artillery, and
all their Riches: 4000 of the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſlain upon the Place,
and a great many wounded, beſide thoſe that were killed,

            <p>But, tho' this Succeſs did conſiderably heighten the Courage of the Beſiegers, yet it did at not all abate the Reſolution of the Garriſon to defend ſo important a Place to the laſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
and therefore, tho' the former attacked it every way
with all the Reſolution imaginable, yet the other obſtinately
perſiſted to repulſe them by frequent Sallies, and making new
Intrenchments, and other Defences behind the Works that
were ruined by the Imperialiſts Cannon. And this continued
for the Remainder of <hi>July,</hi> the whole Month of <hi>Aug.</hi> and to
the 11th of <hi>Sept.</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with his Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
Forces, arrived in the Camp; who taking up their Poſt
on the Left-hand of the Bridge, immediately raiſed a Battery

Summons in Turkiſh and in Latin, in his Imperial Majeſty's

and told him, That he had no need to give up the Town
being provided with all Things neceſſary for its Defence
Whereupon, the <hi>Bavarians</hi> fell furiouſly on, and advanced the
Siege very much on their ſide; but the <hi>Germans</hi> ſucceeded not
ſo well. And this continued for ſeveral Days, when, on <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>

than they had done at any time before, while the Seraſquie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who had a good Army without, uſed all his Endeavours at the

the Left of <hi>Weiſſemberg;</hi> and, notwithſtanding the great Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
made by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to repulſe them, they ſucceeded
ſo well as to get 600 Men into the Place. Now the Siege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be fainter and fainter; and the Beſieged appeared eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day more vigorous than other: And ſo Things continued
almoſt for a Month longer, when the Garriſon made 3 great
Sallies on the 24th and 25th of <hi>Oct.</hi> with ſo much Reſolution,
that they killed abundance of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ruined ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of their Works; the <hi>Bavarians</hi> were forced to abandon their
Mines, as being filled with Water; and the chief Mines of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62930:88"/>
Imperialiſts being diſcovered by the <hi>Turks,</hi> they were render'd
uſeleſs; Theſe Conſiderations, and a great Army of the <hi>Infidels</hi>
being by this time got together, under the Seraſquier, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
the ſending of the Marqueſs <hi>Herman</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> into the
Camp; where, after ſeveral Conferences, it was concluded, that
by reaſon of the bad Weather, and the Cavalry wanting Forage
for a long time together, they ſhould raiſe the Siege, and march
off; thinking that more adviſeable, than to ruin the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
And therefore,<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Buda</hi> raiſed.</note> on <hi>Oct.</hi> 29, the Artillery was drawn off,
and ſhipped; and two Days after the whole Army marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

            <p>But ſomewhat to ſweeten the great Loſs and Diſapointment of the <hi>Germans</hi> in the Siege of <hi>Buda,</hi> their Arms proved much more ſucceſsful in other Parts during this Campaign: And
firſt, in <hi>Sclavonia;</hi> where Count <hi>Leſley</hi> having laid Siege to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tovitza,</hi>
the chief City of that Country, on the 11th of <hi>July,</hi>
and carried on the ſame with great Conduct till towards the
20th, he then underſtood that the <hi>Turks,</hi> after having drawn
together all the Forces they could between the <hi>Save</hi> and the
<hi>Drave,</hi> in order to ſuccour the Place, were arrived, under the
Command of the Baſha of <hi>Maratha,</hi> who had the Guard of the
Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> near <hi>Flatina,</hi> about 4 <hi>German</hi> Miles from <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovitza,</hi>
making in all 2500 Men; but were to join the Beg of
<hi>Zerneg</hi> and the Governor of <hi>Grandiſcha,</hi> who for that purpoſe
were, with 1400 more, on their March towards him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Count immediately commanded the Regiments of
<hi>Croats,</hi> making about 4000 Men, to march under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Count <hi>de Trantmarſdorſe,</hi> with Orders to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Enemy's Conjunction; who therefore marched all
Night, and about 7 in the Morning attacked the ſaid Baſha in
his Camp near <hi>Flatina,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Count <hi>Leſley</hi> routs the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Selavonia,</hi> and takes <hi>Virovitz.</hi>
               </note> whom they routed, and purſued, with
conſiderable Slaughter, as far as <hi>Turbinat.</hi> In returning from
hence, they happily met with the other Party, commanded by
the Beg, who knew nothing of the other's Defeat, yet they
made a very weak Reſiſtance, but many of them ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the adjacent Woods. This Expedition being thus
happily over, the Count returned with 12 Standards, and 20
of the moſt conſiderable Priſoners, into the Camp, beſides all
the Proviſions he took, which they had deſigned for the Relief
of that Place. In purſuance of this Defeat, the Garriſon of
<hi>Virovitza</hi> capitulated; and on the 25th the <hi>Germans</hi> took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the Place. But Count <hi>Leſley</hi> was like to have paid
very dear for this Conqueſt and Victory; for while he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
at the Bridge of <hi>Turannovitz,</hi> on the <hi>Drave,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſquier,
being reinforced with ſeveral Troops from <hi>Boſnia,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
from <hi>Walpon</hi> with an Army of about 30000 Men, and
thought to have overpower'd him: Yet the Count having time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Notice of his Deſign, he poſted his Troops (which did not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62930:89"/>
make above 14000 in all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> advantagiouſly between two Moraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and fortified his Camp, and there received the <hi>Turks</hi> with
ſuch Warmth and Vigour, that he repulſed them with Loſs,
but did not think fit to purſue them, he eſteeming it enough to
have made good his Poſt, which, upon further Informations of
the Enemy's Motion, he fortified yet more advantagiouſly;
and towards the latter end of <hi>Sept.</hi> he went to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to
give the Emperor an Account more particularly of his Affairs
on that ſide.</p>
            <p>But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<hi>Tekeley</hi> had put 150 Men and 2 Pieces of Cannon into a ſmall
Place, called <hi>Zeben,</hi> he decamped from <hi>Tarza,</hi> and attacked the
Place ſo ſeaſonably, that he carried it by Aſſault, having put
the <hi>Hungarian</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Deſerters that he found therein to
the Sword. From thence he ſent ſeveral Spies to Count <hi>Tekeley</hi>'s
Army, by whom being informed of the Number of his Troops,
and the Situation of his Camp, he reſolved to attack him; and
accordingly, leaving his Baggage at <hi>Zeben</hi> he marched on the
17th in the Evening, with all his Cavalry, and part of his Foot
which the Horſe-men carried behind them; and being come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
3 in the Morning near the Enemy's Camp, he drew his
Troops into Battalia, and fell upon them before they had time
to put themſelves in a Poſture of Defence; So that all they
could do, in the Confuſion they were in, was, to think of
making their Eſcape, ſome one way, ſome another; inſomuch
that in leſs than an Hour's ſpace he became Maſter of their

done on the <hi>Poliſh</hi> ſide, before we enter upon the Affairs of
the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whoſe firſt Campaign it has been, to make up
the tripple Confederacy. It was in the middle of <hi>Aug.</hi> before
the King of <hi>Poland</hi> joined the Army, at a Place called, <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacs,</hi>
from whence he ſent Detachments to attack the Fortreſs
of <hi>Jaſlowick,</hi> which after a little Contention, was ſurrendred
to him. It was expected after this, that his Majeſty would
either have beſieged <hi>Caminiec,</hi> or march into <hi>Moldavia</hi> or <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachia,</hi>
but neither of the two happened; For, as to the firſt,
he contented himſelf to pretend at firſt to block it up, and
then to throw a few Bombs into it. And as for the other, he
was ſo far from advancing into the Enemies Country, that the
<hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> believing he was engaged in the Siege of the
ſaid Place, marched to the Relief of it. This, when the King
was informed of, he marched to <hi>Kolenzan;</hi> but then it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that there was no more than a Detachment of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
come over the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his Van-guard to charge them; which they did with
that Bravery and Eagerneſs, that the Enemy immediately fled,
leaving a great many ſlain behind them, ſome computing
3000; while the <hi>Poles,</hi> on their ſide, loſt about 100. And
with this ended the Campaign in that Part of the World,
without any Thing that was Memorable, or worth Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Now we ſhall look a little into the Proceedings of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Venice,</hi> upon this preſent Conjuncture. After they had perfected their Alliance with the Emperor, and the King
of <hi>Poland,</hi> in the Spring of the Year, they gave the chief
Command of their Forces to the Procurator <hi>Moroſini,</hi> who had
formerly done them ſignal Service in the War of <hi>Candia,</hi> with
the Title of Captain-General; who, about the Month of <hi>June,</hi>
did rendeſvouz with the Fleet at <hi>Leſſina,</hi> and from thence ſailed
towards <hi>Corfu;</hi> where having ſtaid ſome time, he put to Sea
again, <hi>July</hi> 19, and next Day arrived before <hi>Sancta Maura,</hi>
which is a Portreſs ſituated at the Mouth of the Gulf of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſa,</hi>
on a little Neck of Land, being very ſtrong, and was then
very well fortified, having the Sea on one ſide, and a great
Morals on the other. However, the light Veſſels enter'd the
Port of <hi>Damata,</hi> on the 21ſt, and the Forces landed on each
ſide of the Place at the ſame time; which being done, the
Captain-General ſent the Governour a Summons to ſurrender,
threatning upon his Refuſal, to put all the Garriſon to the
Sword. The other anſwered, That the Fortreſs belonged to
the Grand Signior, who had given him Charge of it; and that
therefore, according to this Duty, he would defend it to the
laſt. But he deſerted the Suburbs on the Eaſt at the ſame
time. On the 23d, the Fleet began to batter the Place, but
with no great Succeſs, becauſe of the high Wind; yet, next
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62930:90"/>
Day the whole Fleet was ſo diſpoſed, as to do moſt Execution
with their Cannon; and the Galleaſſes were advanced within
Muſquet-ſhot of the Fortreſs, and they threw in a great many
Bombs and Fire-balls, with good Succeſs, tho' they themſelves
received ſome Damage from the Guns of the Enemy. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were the Forces that landed idle on their part, for by the
25th they had finiſhed a Battery of 20 Pieces of Cannon, and
the next Day another ſomewhat nearer, but both on the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of the Town; as they raiſed one alſo to the Weſtward
the Days following, wherewith they made a Breach in the
Wall; wherein, however, they were diſturbed in a Sally by
the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were quickly beaten back, but yet ſo, as that
they took care to defend themſelves within; For, by the 1ſt of
<hi>Aug.</hi> they filled up the Breach with Sacks of Straw, and Bales
of Wool, which, yet the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ruined with their Cannon,
and advanced their Trenches to the Counterſcarp; and on the
2d thought to have advanced farther, when they found the
Breach again filled up. This made them deſcend into the Ditch,
a third part whereof was filled on the 3d at Night with Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots;
and in the Morning they made 2 Deſcents more into the
Ditch, their Cannon having not only made a large Breach,
but diſmounted all the Cannon in the Place, which greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
the Beſieged,<note place="margin">The <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> take <hi>Sancta Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi>

every way, ſince the Sieur <hi>Manata</hi> had been poſted with 600
Men on the ſide of <hi>Preveſa,</hi> to ſhut them up that way alſo:
Wherefore, finding the Ditch quite filled up, and receiving
another ſevere Summons, they ſent out 3 Deputies on the 7th;
who being brought to the General, caſt themſelves on the
Ground, praying he would grant them a Capitulation; which
be did, ſo far as to allow them to march out with Arms, and
what they could carry about them, to the Number of 600,
and were convoyed to <hi>Preveſa.</hi> And thus the <hi>Venetians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Maſters of <hi>Sancta Maura,</hi> wherein they found 80 Pieces
of Braſs Cannon, 20 whereof had the Arms of St. <hi>Mark</hi> upon
them, and a great Quantity of Ammunition and Proviſions.
But this Conqueſt was not gained without the Loſs of near
500 Men.</p>

defeated him; and the <hi>Greeks</hi> that had joined them
gave a particular Teſtimony of their Fidelity to the State,

to the facilitating of this Incurſion, the Captain-General had

of the Conqueſt of <hi>Sancta Maura,</hi> becauſe it is ſituated
at the Entrance of the Gulph of <hi>Arta,</hi> which it commands;
where he was no ſooner arrived, but he ordered 5 Gallies and

which are almoſt in ſight of <hi>Preveſa,</hi> with a Deſign to

of the Troops ſafely, in ſpight of all the Firing of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
with their great and ſmall Shot upon them, when the Gallies
advanced at the ſame time within Muſquet ſhot of the Place,
to make a Diverſion, and to facilitate the Diſembarking of the
Troops, which having advanced by Land, paſſed in Galliots,
an Arm of the Sea, about half a Mile abroad, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of General <hi>Straſoldo;</hi> while the <hi>Turks</hi> believing they
deſigned to Land their Troops at the Place where the Gallies
had poſted themſelves, imployed their chief Care on that ſide to
hinder it: But finding their Miſtake, they ſent 500 <hi>Spahi</hi>'s in
great haſte to charge the <hi>Venetian</hi> Troops that paſſed the Arm
of the Sea above-mentioned, but this was too late; for thoſe
Troops were already drawn up in order of Battel, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the <hi>Turks</hi> ſo well that many of them were killed, and the
reſt fled in ſo much Diſorder, that the greateſt part of them

it. Thereupon they landed 4. Pieces of Cannon, and as
many Mortars on the 22d, and next Day ſhot above 300 Bombs
into the Town, which burnt ſeveral Houſes, and before Night
diſmounted all the Enemies Cannon but one, and had all this
while but one Man killed, and few wounded. On the 24th,
they made a Lodgment in the Ditch, and began to Mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Great Tower of the Place, towards the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi>
but they were ſomewhat diſturbed by a Sally of the <hi>Turks,</hi>

the Mine being ready by the 28th, and a conſiderable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Breach
made by the Cannon, Orders were given for a general Aſſault.
But next Morning the <hi>Turks</hi> prevented them, by hanging out

<hi>Monday</hi> the 2d of <hi>Feb.</hi> and on the 7th departed this Life, in
the 37th Year of his Reign, computing it from his Father's
Death, after he had lived 54 Years, 8 Months, and 8 Days.
His Character I will not attempt, it has been done ſo well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
by a Learned Pen: But, for his Religion, if we believe
his Brother that ſucceeded him, he was (however otherwiſe
he appeared outwardly) in his Life, Heart and Soul, a true
Roman Catholick, not only by his Dying in the Communion
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Ceremonies of that Church;
But the Papers taken out of his Strong Box, and which his
Brother took Care to Publiſh to the World, plainly proved
him to be ſo in his Judgment. However, be this as it will,
he had little Regard to any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thing that favoured of Sincere
Religion; for he would occaſionally in his ordinary Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ridicule moſt Opinions, and that Religion moſt of all,
wherein it was ſaid he died. I know not whether it be to
his Praiſe to ſay, He was a Prince the moſt fit to Govern of
any other, and applied himſelf the leaſt to it, which was great
pitty, ſince he had ſuch an Inſight into Men and Things, that
no Monarch of his Age could pretend to compare with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
beſides a mild Diſpoſition, which made him at his Death be
ſo univerſally lamented by all ſorts of his Proteſtant Subjects,
but more by thoſe that diſſented from the Publick Church, out
of the Fear they had of the Religion, and Temper of his
Succeſſor, than any real Kindneſs for his Government, which of
latter Years eſpecially, had not been very mild towards them.
But for my part, I think a witty Quaker made a truer Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Conjuncture than any other, for appearing very
merry and jovial, when all about him diſcovered all the Marks
of Sorrow imaginable for the King's Death, and being asked

as great a Monarch, as he could wiſh; and therefore, as he
would never depart from the juſt Rights and Prerogatives of
the Crown, ſo he would never invade any Man's Property. It
was well enough ſpoke of him, and as well acted, that he did

That after having given them ſuch Aſſurances, he could not
doubt but of a ſuitable return on their part, and particularly in
what related to the ſettling of <hi>his Revenues,</hi> as he called it, as
it was in his Brother's time; That he might uſe many Arguments
to them for enforcing his Demand from the benefit of Trade,
ſupply of the Navy, the neceſſity of the Crown, and the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
of the Government it ſelf, which he was not to ſuffer to
be precarious; That he foreſaw there was one popular Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which might be uſed againſt what he asked, from the
inclination Men had for frequent Parliaments, which ſome
might think would be beſt ſecured by feeding him from time to
time, by ſuch proportions, as they ſhould think convenient;
But that Argument, it being the firſt time he ſpake to them
from the Throne, he would anſwer once for all, that that would
be a very improper Method to take with him, that the beſt
way to ingage him to meet them often, was to uſe him always
well, and therefore he expected a ſpeedy Compliance with his
Demands now, that he might meet them again to all their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions.</p>
            <p>But tho this was a very odd way of careſſing a Parliament,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gives him a great deal of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note>
yet they being in a manner faſhioned before to his hand, they
were ſo far from taking notice of it, and what was more, of the
moſt grievous and dangerous State of the whole Nation, as it
was left by King <hi>Charles,</hi> that inſtead of repreſenting the ſame
to the now King, or redreſſing any Grievance, they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave him a Revenue to enable him to ruin the Church and
State upon the Foundation his Brother had laid for him; for

beſides their ſettling the Cuſtoms and Temporary Exciſe upon
him, as they were before upon his Brother; They laid a new
Impoſition upon Wines and Vinegars, made an Act to lay more
Cuſtom upon Sugars and Tobacco; another laying an Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon all <hi>French</hi> Linnens, and all <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Linnen, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other <hi>Indian</hi> Manufactures; alſo upon <hi>French</hi> Wrought

Nation thought them always before too great) the Act for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
the Importation of <hi>French</hi> Wine, Vinegar, Brandy,
Linnens, and Cloth, Silks, Malt, Paper, or any Manufacture
made or mix'd with Silk, Thread, Wool, Hair, Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or Leather, being of the Growth or Manufacture of
<hi>France,</hi> was now fully repealed. There was alſo five Shillings
<hi>per</hi> Tun granted upon every Voyage, which any foreign Ship
ſhould make from Port to Port in <hi>England,</hi> and Twelve-pence
<hi>per</hi> Tun, for every Voyage which a Foreign built Ship, not
free, ſhould make; ſo that in ſhort, this Revenue with the
Hereditary Exciſe, and other Revenues of the Crown, have
been computed to amount to 2400000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> to which,
if you add 15000 <hi>per Annum,</hi> which the King had when he
was Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the whole will amount to 2550000 <hi>per An.</hi>
which was 3 times more than any King of <hi>England</hi> (except
<hi>Henry</hi> VIII.) had before the King's Brother. But before this
Seſſions was over, they heard of ſomething, not only from
the North, but alſo from the Weſt, that did not a little terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the greateſt part of them.</p>
            <p>The King in the Cloſe of the fore-mentioned Speech, the very Day of the Opening of the Parliament, told them, That he had News that Morning from <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the Earl of

have of late been broken, and nothing left unattempted for
turning our limited Monarchy into an abſolute Tyranny: For
ſuch hath been the Tranſaction of Affairs within this Nation
for ſeveral Years laſt paſt, that though the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Liberties of the People were fenced and hedged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
by as many Laws as the Wiſdom of Man could deviſe for
their Preſervation againſt Popery and Arbitrary Power, our
Religion hath been all along countermined by Popiſh Counſels,
and our Privileges raviſhed from us by Fraud and Violence.
And more eſpecially, the whole Courſe and Series of the Life
of the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> hath been but one continued Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Reformed Religion, and the Rights of the Nation:
For, whoever conſiders his contriving the burning of <hi>London,</hi>
his inſtigating a Confederacy with <hi>France,</hi> and a War with
<hi>Holland,</hi> his fomenting the Popiſh Plot, and encouraging the
Murther of Sir <hi>Ed. Godfrey</hi> to ſtifle it; his charging Treaſon
againſt Proteſtants, ſuborning Witneſſes to ſwear the Patriots
of our Religion and Liberties out of their Lives; his hiring
execrable Villains to aſſaſſinate the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thoſe others to be clandeſtinely cut off, in hopes to conceal
it; his adviſing and procuring the Prorogation and Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Parliaments, in order to prevent their looking into his
Crimes, and that he might eſcape the Juſtice of the Nation;
Such can imagine nothing ſo black and horrid in it ſelf, or ſo
ruinous and deſtructive to Religion and the Kingdom, which
we may not expect from him.</p>
                        <p>The very Tyrannies which he hath exerciſed ſince he ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Crown from his Brother's Head, do leave none under a Poſſibility of flattering themſelves with Hopes of Safety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eithor
in their Conſciencies, Perſons, or Eſtates; For, in defiance of
all the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, made for the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Reformed Proteſtant Religion, he not only began
his Reign with a bare-faced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A vowing himſelf of the Romiſh
Religion, but call'd in Multitudes of Prieſts and Jeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>its, for
whom the Law makes it Treaſon to come into this Kingdom;
and hath impower'd them to exerciſe Idolatries: And beſides
his being daily preſent at the Worſhip of the Maſs, he hath
publickly aſſiſted at the greateſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>opperies of their Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Neither hath he been more tender in trampling upon
the Laws which concern our Properties, ſeeing in two Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
whereof the one requires the Collecting of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
and the other the continuing that part of the Exciſe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62930:95"/>
which was to expire at the late King's Death; he hath vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
and againſt all the Law of the Land, broken in upon
our Eſtates. Neither is it any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>xtenuation of his Tyranny,
that he is countenanced in it by an Extrajudicial Opinion of
ſeven or eight ſuborned and forſworn Judges; but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the Greatneſs and Extent of the Conſpiracy againſt our
Rights; and that there is no Means left for our Relief, but by
Force of Arms: For, advancing thoſe to the Bench, that were
the Scandal of the Bar; and conſtituting thoſe very Men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the Laws, who were accuſed and branded in Parliament
for perverting them, we are precluded all Hopes of Juſtice in
<hi>Weſtminſter-Hall:</hi> And by packing Juries together by falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns,
new illegal Charters, and other corrupt Means, he doth
at once deprive us of all Expectations of Succour where our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
were wont to find it; and hopes to render that which
ought to be the People's Fences againſt Tyranny, and the
Conſervator of their Liberties, the Means of ſubverting all
our Laws, and of eſtabliſhing of his Arbitrarineſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
our Thraldom. So that unleſs we could be contented
to ſee the Reformed Proteſtant Religion and ſuch as profeſs
it extirpated, Popiſh Superſtition and Idolatry eſtabliſhed,
the Laws of the Land trampled under foot, the Liberties and
Rights of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People ſubverted, and all that is Sacred
and Civil, or of Regard amongſt Men of Vertue or Piety,
violated; and unleſs we could be willing to be Slaves as well
as Papiſts, and forget the Example of our noble and generous
Anceſtors, who convey'd our Privileges to us at the Expence
of their Blood and Treaſure; and withal, be unmindful of our
Duty to GOD, our Country, and Poſterity; deaf to the
Cries and Groans of our oppreſſed Friends, and be ſatisfied,
not only to ſee them and our ſelves impriſoned, robbed and
murthered, but the Proteſtant Intereſt throughout the whole
World betrayed to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> We are bound, as Men,
and Chriſtians, and that in Diſcharge of our Duty to GOD
and our Country, and for the Satisfaction of the Proteſtant
Nations round about us, to betake our ſelves to Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which, we take Heaven and Eearth to witneſs, we ſhould not
have done, had not the Malice of our Enemies deprived us
of all other Means of Redreſs; and were not the Miſeries that
we already feel, and thoſe which do further threaten us, worſe
than the Calamities of War. And it is not for any perſonall
Injuries, or private Diſcontents, nor in purſuance of any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Intereſt, that we take our Swords in our Hands; but for
vindicating our Religion, Laws and Rights, and reſcuing our
Country from Ruin and Deſtruction, and for the preſerving
our ſelves, Wives and Children from Bondage and Idolatry.
Wherefore, before GOD, Angels and Men, we ſtand acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from, and do charge upon our Enemies, all the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62930:95"/>
and Devaſtations that unavoidably accompany Inteſtine
War.</p>
                        <p>Now, therefore we do hereby ſolemnly declare and proclaim War againſt <hi>J.</hi> D. of <hi>Y.</hi> as a Murtherer, and an Aſſaſſmator of innocent Men, a Traytor to the Nation, and a Tyrant over
the People. And we would have none that appear under his
Banner to flatter themſelves with Expectation of Forgiveneſs,
it being our firm Reſolution to proſecute him and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
without giving way to Treaties and Accommodations,
until we have brought him and them to undergo what the
Rules of the Conſtitution, and the Statutes of the Realm, as
well as the Laws of Nature, Scripture and Nations, adjudge to
be Puniſhment due to the Enemies of GOD, Mankind, their
Country, and all things that are honourable, vertuous and
good.</p>
                        <p>And though we cannot avoid being ſenſible that too many have, from Cowardiſe, Covetouſneſs and Ambition, co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to the ſubverting of our Religion, and enſlaving their
Country; yet we would have none, from a Deſpair of finding
Mercy, perſevere in their Crimes, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> continue the Ruin of
the Kingdom: For we exclude none from the Benefit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that will join with us in retrieving that they have been
acceſſary to the Loſs of: Nor do we deſign Revenge upon any,
but the Obſtinate, and ſuch as ſhall be found at this Juncture
yielding Aid and Aſſiſtance to the ſaid <hi>J.</hi> D. of <hi>Y.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that we may both govern our ſelves in the Purſuit of this glorious Cauſe wherein we are engaged, and give Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all that ſhall aſſiſt us in ſo righteous and neceſſary
an Undertaking, we do, in the Preſence of the LORD, who
knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts, and is the Avenger of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and Falſhood, proclaim and publiſh what we aim at; and
for the obtaining whereof, we have both determined to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and are ready to lay down our Lives. And though we
are not come, into the Field to introduce Anarchy and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or for laying aſide any part of the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet our Purpoſes and Reſolutions are, to reduce Things
to that Temperament and Ballance, that future Rulers may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
able to do all the Good that can be either deſired or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from them; and that it may not be in their Power to
invade the Rights, and infringe the Liberties of the People.</p>
                        <p>And whereas our Religion, the moſt valuable thing we lay claim unto, hath been ſhaken by unjuſt Laws, undermined by Popiſh Counſels, and is now in danger to be ſubverted; we
are therefore reſolyed to ſpend our Blood for preſerving it to
our ſelves and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>oſterity: Nor will we lay down our Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till
we ſee it eſtabliſhed and ſecured beyond all probability of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſupplanted and overthrown, and until all the Penal Laws
againſt all Proteſtant Diſſenters be repealed, and Legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62930:96"/>
made againſt their being diſturbed by reaſon of their
Conſciences, and for their enjoying an equal Liberty with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proteſtants.</p>
                        <p>And that the Meekneſs and Purity of our Principles, and the Moderation and Righteouſneſs of our End, may appear unto all Men, We do declare, That we will not make War upon,
or deſtroy any for their Religion, how falſe and erronious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
So that the very Papiſts, provided they withdraw from
the Tents of our Enemies, and be not found guilty of conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our Deſtruction, or Abbettors of them that ſeek it, have
nothing to fear on apprehend from us, except what may
hinder their altering our Laws, and indangering our Perſons
in the Profeſſion of the Reformed Doctrine, and Exerciſe of
our Chriſtian Worſhip.</p>
                        <p>Our Reſolution in the next place, is, To maintain all the juſt Rights and Privileges of Parliaments, and to have Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Annually choſen and held, and not prorogued, diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or diſcontinued within the Year, before Petitions be firſt
anſwered, and Grievances redreſſed.</p>
                        <p>And ſeeing many of the Miſeries under which the Nation doth groan, ariſe from diſplacing ſuch out of the Number of Judges as would not, for the promoting Popiſh and Arbitrary
Deſigns, wreſt and miſ-apply the Laws; and from conſtituting
corrupt and mercenary Men in their Rooms, on purpoſe to
ſtretch the Laws beyond the Reaſon and Intention of them,
and to declare that for Law which is not; we can neither
with Silence paſs over the mentioning of them; nor ſhould
we have Peace in our ſelves, if we did not endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the like Miſchief in Time to come: For by reaſon of ill
Men's being advanced to the Bench, and holding their Places
only <hi>durante bene-placito,</hi> many Perſons have been condemned
in exorbitant Fines for no Crimes, or for very ſmall ones:
Many Statutes made for the Safety of the Subject, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, have been wickedly eluded, to the
Oppreſſion of the Innocent and Loyal Men. The Popiſh
Lords that were impeached in Parliament, for a moſt helliſh
Conſpiracy, have, to the ſubverting the Rights of the Houſe
of Lords, been diſcharged, and ſet free. The impoſing a May;
or and Sheriffs upon the City of <hi>London</hi> by Fraud and Violence
have been juſtified; and thoſe who, in diſcharge of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
oppoſed it, illegally proſecuted, and arbitrarily puniſhed,
<hi>London,</hi> and other Cities and Corporations, have been robbed
of their Charters upon unrighteous Judgments of pretended
Forfeitures. Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> executed, without being
allowed the Benefit of a Trial. Col. <hi>Algernoon Sidney</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to die, upon the Depoſition of one ſcandalous Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And that Loyal and Excellent Perſon, the late <hi>William</hi>
Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> murthered for alledged Crimes; in reference to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62930:96"/>
which, if all had been true which was ſworn againſt him, yet
there was nothing which, according to Law, could have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Life. Upon the Conſideration aforeſaid, we further
declare, that we will have Care taken for the future for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring
ignorant, ſcandalous and mercenary Men from the
Adminiſtration of Juſtice; and that the Judges ſhall hold their
Places by the ancient Tenure of <hi>quamdiu ſe bene geſſerint;</hi>
and to leave it to the Wiſdom of a Parliament, to ſettle ſome
Way, and Method for the Approbation of ſuch as ſhall be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Degree and Dignity of Judges.</p>
                        <p>And foraſmuch as the Invaſion made on the Right of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Burroughs and Towns Corporate; the Seiſure of their Charters, whether by Surrender, or upon pretence of Borfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
have been wholly arbitrary and illegal; we likewiſe
therefore declare, we will, to our utmoſt, endeavour to ſee
them re-poſſeſſed in what they formerly had, and could legally
lay claim to; and that we do eſteem all Judgments given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and all Surrenders made by a corrupt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
Party amongſt them, null and void in Law; and do
hold and declare their old Charters, notwithſtanding the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ones lately granted, to be good and valid: And accordingly,
we do invite and encourage all honeſt Burgeſſes and Free-men
to re-aſſume the Rights and Privileges which, by virtue of the
ſaid old Charters, belonged to their ſeveral and reſpective
Corporations; and to deliver themſelves from thoſe late
Paraſites, and Inſtruments of Tyranny, ſet up to oppreſs
them.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, for the Reſtoring the Kingdom to its Primitive Condition of Freedom and Safety, we will have the <hi>Copora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Militia Acts</hi> repealed: And all Outlawries of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

revenge it to the utmoſt upon ſuch of our Enemies as ſhall
fall into our Hands.</p>
                        <p>And whereas the ſaid <hi>J.</hi> D. of <hi>Y.</hi> in order to the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Idolatrous and Bloody Deſigns of the Papiſts, the Gratifying his own boundleſs Ambition after a Crown, and
to hinder Enquiry into the Aſſaſſination of <hi>Arthur,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi>

his Ingratitude, as well as Cruelty to the World, in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
a Brother who had almoſt ruined himſelf, to preſerve
and protect him from Puniſhment; We do therefore further
declare, That for the aforeſaid villainous and unnatural
Crime, and other his Crimes before-mentioned, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of the Reſolution of both Houſes of Parliament, who
voted to revenge the King's Death in caſe he came to an <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely

of ſo execrable a Fact.</p>
                        <p>And in a more particular Manner, His Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> being ſenſible of the barbarous and horrid Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide committed upon his Father, doth reſolve to purſue the

of his Friends, and the Law, to have Juſtice executed upon

                        <p>And the ſaid <hi>James,</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the now Head and Captain-General of the Proteſtant Forces of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, aſſembled for the End aforeſaid, from the Generouſneſs
of his own Nature, and the Love he bears to theſe Nations,
whoſe Welfare and Settlement he infinitely prefers to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

to be a Man of no great Parts, yet that he had a Warlike Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
and was better skilled in the Military Art, than any the

Thing in effect having been communicated to <hi>Skelton,</hi> at the

the King put off Monſieur <hi>Bentink,</hi> with telling him, He ſhould

unto him in ſuch Terms, as ſufficiently diſcover'd he did not

However, King <hi>James</hi> did well enough at this time,
without ſuch Aſſiſtance, and he was ſo far favoured in the

<hi>Sedgmore,</hi> ſoon after taken, and ordered to be brought up to
<hi>London</hi> forthwith, with no other Deſign, you may be ſure, than
to have his Head chopt off: However, not to be wanting to

                     </note> it is the Miſfortune I now
lie under, makes me make this Application to You:
But I do aſſure Your Majeſty, it is the Remorſe I now have
in me, of the Wrong I have done You in ſeveral Things;
and now, in taking up Arms againſt You. For my taking up
Arms: It never was in my Thoughts, ſince the <hi>King</hi> died:
The Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> will be Witneſs for me, of
the Aſſurance I gave them, That I would never ſtir againſt
You. But my Misfortune was ſuch, as to meet with ſome
Horrid People, that made me believe Things of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and gave me ſo many falſe Arguments, that I was fully
led away to believe, That it was a Shame, and a Sin before
<hi>God,</hi> not to do it. But, <hi>SIR,</hi> I will not trouble Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
at preſent, with many Things I could ſay for my ſelf,
that, I am ſure, would move Your Compaſſion. The chief
End of this <hi>Letter,</hi> being only to beg of You, That I may
have that Happineſs, as to ſpeak to Your Majeſty: For, I
have that to ſay to You, <hi>SIR,</hi> that, I hope, may give You
a long and happy Reign. I am ſure, <hi>SIR,</hi> when You hear
me, You will be convinced of the Zeal I have for Your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
and how heartily I repent of what I have done. I
can ſay no more to Your Majeſty now, being this <hi>Letter</hi> muſt
be ſeen by thoſe that keep me. Therefore, <hi>SIR,</hi> I ſhall
make an end, in begging of Your Majeſty to believe ſo well
of me, That I would rather die a Thouſand Deaths, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
any Thing I have done, if I did not really think my ſelf
the moſt in the Wrong, that ever any Man was; and had not
from the Bottom of my Heart an Abhorrence for thoſe, that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62930:98"/>
put me upon it; and for the Action it ſelf. I hope, <hi>SIR,
God</hi> Almighty will ſtrike Your Heart with Mercy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for me, as He has done mine with the Abhorrence of
what I have done. Therefore, I hope, <hi>SIR,</hi> I may live to
ſhew You, how zealous I ſhall ever be for Your Service; and
could I ſay but one Word in this <hi>Letter,</hi> You would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of it; but it is of that Conſequence, that I dare not
do it. Therefore, <hi>SIR,</hi> I do beg of You once more, to let
me ſpeak to You; for then You will be convinced, how much
I ſhall ever be,</q>

            <p>What Impreſſions this, or what afterwards the Duke told him in Private, might have upon the King's Heart, I know not, but the Conſequence proved, he little regarded it, by
haſtening of the Execution; which was done the next Day
but one after his arrival,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Monmouth</hi> Beheaded.</note> upon <hi>Tower-Hill, July</hi> 15, unheard,
by Virtue of an Attainder paſt upon him in this Parliament.
A brave, but unhappy Man, not only in the Manner of his
Death, but the Education of his Youth; whereby he became
too much Tainted with the Vices of the then Court, where he
could learn no better; but it was hoped, he did not end as he
began; for, he ſaid himſelf upon the Scaffold, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it for a Mercy, That for 2 Years before, he had led a Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more Reformed Life than ever. And here I can't
but take Notice of the Manner wherewith ſome of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
who were appointed to aſſiſt him in the laſt Moments
of his Life, treated the poor Gentleman; the main of all they
ſaid to him, being to preſs him to acknowledge their foppiſh
Doctrine of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> which they alledged was ſuch,
that without it, he could not be a Member of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> as he profeſt himſelf to be. But all they could do,
could not bring him to it; and in Truth, it would grieve any
Heart, but ſuch as was wofully prejudiced with the Bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of thoſe Times, to find a Man under ſuch Circumſtances
teazed, as he was, who by any Thing that appeared to the
Contrary, was as much diſcompoſed with that Way of Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as with the Death he was then ready to undergo.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid, a certain Brave old Officer, who then came over with him, and ſince with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> offered, with a ſmall Party of Horſe, to have ventured thro' all the
Guards, and take him from off the Scaffold; But they could
not be got together: His Time was come, and Providence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62930:99"/>
that our Deliverance ſhould be more Juſt, Peaceable,
and Wonderful; and that the Glory, as well as the many Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
we have ſince enjoyed, ſhould be reſerved to our Pious,
and Renouned Monarch, King <hi>William,</hi> whom God grant long
to Reign over us.</p>
            <p>But the Iſſue of Blood did not ſtop with the Duke's Death,<note place="margin">The cruel Executions in the <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note>
and the Executions that followed, were as Cruel, and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
as happened in any Age, or the worſt of Tyrant's Reigns.
I am very loath to enter into any of the Particulars, ſince all
that have Travelled in the Weſtern Parts, have been Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of it for Years after this. It were enough to ſatisfie
ſome, to ſay, that <hi>Jefferies</hi> the Chief Juſtice, now a Peer of
<hi>England,</hi> forſooth, by the Title of Lord <hi>Jefferies,</hi> Baron of
<hi>Wen,</hi> it had been better of <hi>Acheron,</hi> and the firſt Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
after <hi>Hubert de Burg,</hi> I think, that was made ſo, had a
Special Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> to try the poor
Wretches. But I'll give a few Particulars; The firſt that fell
under his fiery Rage, was <hi>Alicia Liſle,</hi> a Woman of extream
Age, and Relict of <hi>John Liſle,</hi> one of K. <hi>Charles</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'s Judges,
who was Tryed at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> for High-Treaſon, for Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Aſſiſting Rebels; the Pretence being, that ſhe had
Concealed Mr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> the Non-conformiſt Miniſter, and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Nelthrop,</hi> the latter being a perfect Stranger, and the
former in no Proclamation, which made the Jury bring her in
3 times not Guilty; But at laſt <hi>Jefferies</hi> Threats ſo far prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ſhe was brought in Guilty of High-Treaſon, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
for it. Yet the Convention after King <hi>William</hi> came
in, were ſo diſſatisfied in her Caſe, that tho' they could not
reſtore her to Life, they Reverſed the Judgment for her Death.
From thence <hi>Jefferies</hi> Poſts to <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> where underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there were 30 Perſons that had been found by the Grand
Inqueſt, to have been Aſſiſting the Duke of <hi>Monmouth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this Stratagem to diſpatch them, for when they came
upon their Tryals, and before they had Pleaded, he told
them, That whoſoever Pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and was found ſo,
ſhould have little time to live; and if any expected Favour,
they muſt Plead <hi>Guilty.</hi> But the Priſoners would not truſt
him, tho' it had in a manner been all one to them, for of the
30, 29 were found Guilty, and Executed ſoon after; as were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o more our of 243, who were deluded to Plead Guilty to
their Indictments. The ſame was done at <hi>Exeter</hi> to near as
many, who were alike deluded; as alſo at <hi>Taunton,</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi>
where <hi>Jefferies</hi> finiſhed his Bloody Aſſizes, and in which Two
Places he Condemned above 500 Perſons, whereof 239 were
Executed, and had their Quarters ſet up in the principal Places,
and Roads of thoſe Countries, to the Terror of Paſſengers, and
the great Annoyance of thoſe Parts. But <hi>Jefferies</hi> was not
the only Perſon that was the King's Agent in this bloody
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62930:99"/>
Work; for <hi>Kirk,</hi> one of his Majeſty's good Officers, had, after
the Duke's Defeat, cauſed 90 wounded Men at <hi>Taunton,</hi> to be
hanged, not only without permiting their Wives and Children
to ſpeak to them, but with Pipes playing, Drums beating,
and Trumpets ſounding; and boiled their Quarters in Pitch,
to ſet them up in ſeveral Parts of the Town: Though <hi>Kirk</hi>
was poſitive afterwards, when he was charg'd with being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in ſuch Barbarity, That he had Inſtructions both from
the King and his General to do what he did. But what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
ſoever <hi>Kirk</hi> had for what he did, <hi>Jefferies</hi> took to
himſelf a greater Latitude in Reprieving ſome who had Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and afterwards procuring Pardons for them; and he had
the Conſcience to take 14500 <hi>l.</hi> of one Man to ſave him, with
which be bought a very fine Eſtate. But thoſe poor Wretches,
who could not purchaſe Pardons at my Lord's Rate, were fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſold for Slaves into the <hi>American</hi> Plantations: And when Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
could take place no longer, out came a Pardon, but ſo
ridiculouſly Cruel, as Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> expreſſes it, as could ſcarcely
be believed; for thoſe who made their Eſcape were not only
excepted, but alſo Girls of 8 or 9 Years old, who had made a
few Colours, and preſented them to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
while he was at <hi>Taunton,</hi> were excepted by Name; and no
Pardon could be purchaſed for this Treaſon, till the Girls Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
had paid more for it, than would have provided a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Portion
for them when at Age. By all which Paſſages
you have very pregnant Examples, not only of the Avarice
of the Miniſters, but the King's Promiſe to imitate his
Brother's Clemency and Tenderneſs to his People. Neither
will any Man think his Majeſty's Goodneſs to come ſhort of the
reſt in his Severity to Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> who, in <hi>Oct.</hi> this Year, was
taken up as he was freely following his Profeſſion, and clapt
cloſe Priſoner in <hi>Newgate,</hi> without Pen, Ink, or Paper, or any
Body to aſſiſt him, or as much as ſuffered to come at him;
and about a Week after was Tryed upon an Indictment of
High-Treaſon,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> Try'd.</note> for that in the Year 1682, he had promiſed to
be aſſiſting to <hi>James,</hi> late Duke of <hi>Monmouth, William Ruſſel,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> &amp;c. in their Treaſons againſt <hi>Charles</hi> I.
Surely, one ſhould think, his Brother had a mighty Reſpect
for his Memory: But there was another Snake in the Graſs;
Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> when Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> had been very active a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Popiſh Conſpirators; ſo that now nothing leſs than
a Sacrifice of Humane Blood could appeaſe the offended Ghoſts
of thoſe that periſhed for that Plot. The only Witneſs againſt
this poor Gentleman, was Col. <hi>Rumſey,</hi> who had plaid his Part
before, and was eaſily believed here alſo; though no honeſt
Man would have hanged a Dog upon his Evidence. As for
what <hi>Dick Goodenough</hi> ſaid, it was not very material, though
it ſeemed to have been malicious enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Raſcal, with Impudence enough, and many curſed Oaths,
juſtifie what he ſaid: So that the worthy Citizen was Caſt and
Executed;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> Executed.</note> as much lamented for a Man of his Quality, and
with ſuch ſevere Cenſures from the Generality of People, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Hardſhip and Injuſtice done him, as any other in our
Age whatſoever: And I have heard it ſaid, That even King
<hi>James</hi> himſelf, ſome time after, expreſs'd ſomewhat of Regret
concerning it.</p>
            <p>But, though <hi>Corniſh</hi> his Caſe ſeemed to have been reſented more particularly by the People in this Turmoil of the Times; yet the violent and rigorous Proceedings of the King and his
bloody Agents did not paſs unobſerved,<note place="margin">K. <hi>James</hi>'s Proceedings in reſpect to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> and left ſuch Seeds of
Diſcontent in the Minds of moſt, that though they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
bud forth, yet other Occaſions made them in time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to purpoſe: All this the Court could not not, or would
not diſcern; ſo that they kept on their Pace, though yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more covertly in <hi>England.</hi> But the Popiſh Deſigns ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by this time bare-faced enough in <hi>Ireland;</hi> for the King
was no ſooner ſettled in his Throne, but he began to turn out
ſome Officers there, who had been moſt zealous for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and deſerved better at his Hands, meerly becauſe they
had been counted firm to the Proteſtant Religion, and <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Intereſt; particularly my Lord <hi>Shannon,</hi> Captain <hi>Robert Fitz-Gerald,</hi>
Captain <hi>Richard Coote,</hi> Sir <hi>George St. George,</hi> and put
into their Places one <hi>Kerney</hi> (a Ruffian, that deſigned to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Charles</hi> II.) <hi>Anderſon,</hi> an obſcure Fellow; <hi>Sheldon,</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Papiſt; <hi>Graham,</hi> and ſome more of the Stamp; and at
the ſame time ſent for the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> very abruptly,
and diveſted him of the Government of that Kingdom, to
make way for Colonel <hi>Richard Talbot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Talbot</hi>'s Villany.</note> a Man of all others, moſt
hated by the Proteſtants, to model the Army, and one who
had been named by <hi>Oats</hi> in his Narrative Years before for this
Service: So that many, who before believed nothing of the
Plot, gave Credit to it now, ſaying, <hi>That if</hi> Oats <hi>were an ill
Evidence, he was certainly a good Prophet. Talbot</hi> was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
inveſted with his Office, but he proſecuted it in ſuch a
manner, as might beſt be expected from a Man of ſo inſolent
a Temper, exerciſing at the ſame time, ſo much Barbarity and
Falſhood, that if the Army had not been the beſt Principled
with Loyalty and Obedience in the World, they had Muti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed,
or at leaſt ſent him packing into another World. He would
take an Officer in the Morning into his Cloſet, and with all
the Oaths, Curſes and Damnations that were never wanting
to him, profeſs all Friendſhip and Kindneſs to him, and promiſe
the Continuance of his Commiſſion to him; but when the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
came, would caſheer him with all the Contempt and
Diſgrace imaginable: Nay, perhaps, while he was thus careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him, he had actually given away his Commiſſion to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62930:100"/>
And if he thus Brutiſhly uſed the Officers, you cannot
think he could be kinder and more mannerly towards the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and Troopers, whoſe way with them was, to march them
from their uſual Quarters, to ſome remote Place, where he
thought they were leaſt known, and would be put to greateſt
Hardſhips, and there he would ſtrip them; the Foot of their
Cloaths, for which they had paid, and the Troopers of their
Horſes, Boots and Accouterments, bought with their own
Money, and ſet them to walk bare-footed an 100, and an
150 Miles to their Homes or Friends, if they had any. Its
true, he would ſometimes promiſe them ſomething for their
Horſes, but then they muſt go to <hi>Dublin</hi> for it; and if any
were ſo credulous as to go to demand the ſmall Pittance he
had promiſed them, or Arrears of Pay, he contrived it ſo,
that they were obliged to wait till they had ſpent there as much
as they expected, though moſt of them after all got nothing:
By this mean 2 or 300 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, who had laid out
all, or great Part of their Portions, or contracted Debts on
Commiſſions, were left not worth any thing, and turn'd out
without Reaſon or Conſideration, and 5 or 6000 Soldiers
ſent a begging; and yet Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel,</hi> ſo early as in <hi>July</hi>
this Year, recommended this <hi>Talbot</hi> to the King, as a moſt
fit Perſon to be Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in ſome
time he obtained it, beſides the Dignity of Earl of <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connell.</hi>

               <note place="margin">K. <hi>James</hi>'s Speech to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> finding he might do what he would in <hi>Ireland,</hi> thought he had now, his great Rival was taken off, a clear Field to do the ſame in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
he had found his Parliament laſt Seſſions extraordinarily
plyable to his Deſire; and therefore, at their next meeting
in <hi>Nov.</hi> he told them, That the Militia, ſo much before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on, was not ſufficient for his Occaſions, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would do but a ſtanding Force of well diſciplin'd Troops,
to defend him from all ſuch as either at Home or Abroad were
diſpoſed to diſturb the Nation: That therefore, the Concern
he had both of his own and Subjects Tranquility, made him
think it neceſſary to increaſe the Number as he had done.
That he owed this as well to the Honour as Security of the
Nation, whoſe Reputation had been ſo infinitely expoſed to
all its Neighbours, by being laid open to the late wretched
Attempt, that it could not be repaired without keeping ſuch
a Body of Men on Foot, that none might ever have the
Thoughts again of finding them ſo miſerably unprovided;
That therefore he required a Supply anſwerable to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
and that he could not doubt, but what they had begun
ſo much to the Honour and Defence of the Government,
would be continued by them, with all the Cheerfulneſs and
Readineſs that was requiſite for a Work of ſo great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62930:101"/>
But then he came to the Nice Point, and ſaid, That
no Man ſhould take Exception, that ſome Officers in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
were not qualified for their Imployments, according to the
late Teſts; for that he muſt tell them, thoſe Gentlemen, were
moſt of them, well known to him, and having formerly ſerved
him on ſeveral Occaſions, and always approved the Loyalty of
their Principles by their Practice, he thought them now fit
to be imployed under him, and that he would deal plainly
with them; That after having had the Benefit of their Services,
in ſuch a time of Need and Danger, he would neither expoſe
them to Diſgrace, nor himſelf to the Want of them, if there
ſhould be another Rebellion to make them neceſſary to him:
Then he cajol'd them with what Feats he had already done
for the Nation, and how much more he would do ſtill, even to
the Hazard of his Life, in the Defence and true Intereſt of
the Nation, and hoped, no groundleſs Fears and Jealouſies
ſhould put a Stop thereunto; with ſomething more to the
ſame Purpoſe, which I ſhall not trouble my ſelf nor the Reader
with, but come to tell him; that both Houſes entered into a
Debate upon the Speech.<note place="margin">The Lords Voted Thanks for the Speech.</note> Some of the Lords were againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
his Majeſty Thanks for it, and ſpoke pretty ſmartly to

and on the 16th of <hi>Nov.</hi> Addreſt the King; wherein
they repreſented to him, that they had taken his Speech, and
particularly that part of it relating to the unqualified Officers
into their Conſideration; That for what was paſt, they were
preparing a Bill to paſs both Houſes for the Royal Aſſent, to
indemnifie them from the Penalty they had incurred by Law;
but becauſe the Continuance of them in their Imployments
might be thought to be a diſpenſing Power with that Law,
without Act of Parliament; They therefore humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
him, that he would be pleaſed to give ſuch Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
therein, that no Apprehenſions or Jealouſies might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Hearts of his good and faithful Subjects: But
what do you think was the Conſequence of this Addreſs?
'Twas no other than firſt a Prorogation,<note place="margin">Parliament diſſolved.</note> and then the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

Its a long Step from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Hungary,</hi> I confeſs, but
there being no conſiderable Affairs in Motion now nearer

you firſt of the ill Succeſs of the Imperial Army before <hi>Buda</hi>

to which End, I am to acquaint you, That the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi>

broad. The River <hi>Neutra</hi> runs on the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> not above a Piſtol
ſhot from it, as the <hi>Danube</hi> is on the <hi>South,</hi> about 2 Furlongs
diſtance, and the River <hi>Schit,</hi> on the <hi>Weſt.</hi> The whole Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Army, with the Auxiliary Troops of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemburg,</hi>
being poſted with ſome Difficulty about the Place;
the Trenches were opened <hi>July</hi> 11, at Night, by 3000 Foot,
on whom the Beſieged fired all along without doing any great
Execution, and by the 13th, they were carried on within 50
Paces of the Ditch, when they had alſo finiſhed a Redoubt:
But next Day the Enemy made a Sally with a Party of Horſe
upon the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Guard, yet were quickly beaten back into
the Town with ſome Loſs, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight the Beſiegers finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
another Redoubt on the Left, and the Line of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
between the Trenches, in the middle whereof they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to raiſe a Battery of 10 Pieces of Cannon, and at the
ſame time began a falſe Attack on the <hi>South,</hi> oppoſite to
the true one, which gave the Beſieged a Diverſion that way.
On the 15th they played upon one another briskly with their
Cannon, and at Night the Beſiegers got to the Ditch in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places, both on the Right and Left, but with conſiderable
Loſs; and on the 16th, the Imperialiſts began a new Battery
againſt the Palliſadoes before the Gate, which ſet fire to them,
and forced the <hi>Turks</hi> to abandon that Place. They continued alſo
their Works next Day, and prepared Things to fill the Ditch,
to which End the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> ordered the <hi>Lunemburghers</hi>
on the Left, to cut a Canal, to let the Water out of it into
the <hi>Neutra,</hi> when at the ſame time receiving Advice, that the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army was marched towards <hi>Gran,</hi> he ſent Colonel
<hi>Heuſler</hi> out towards <hi>Vicegrade,</hi> with a Body of Horſe, to get
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62930:102"/>
Intelligence, and 500 Dragoons, under the Count of <hi>Stirum,</hi>
to paſs one of the Bridges near <hi>Comorra,</hi> and to poſt himſelf
near <hi>Gran;</hi> and 5 Days after upon further Advice, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Dragoons of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> together with the
Imperial Dragoons, making in all about 5000 Thouſand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of the Count <hi>de Lodron,</hi> to march towards
<hi>Comorra,</hi> to cover the Bridges, which his Highneſs had cauſed
to be laid there over the <hi>Danube,</hi> while he in the mean time
beſtirred himſelf with wonderful Activity, to puſh on the Siege,
being every Day preſent in the Trenches, and upon the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
to give all neceſſary Orders; as being very deſirous to
be Maſter of this Place. But notwithſtanding all his Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
and the continued Advances that were made in the Siege,
the <hi>Turks</hi> defended themſelves ſo well, that the Month of <hi>July</hi>
ſpun out, and the Additional Preſence and Aſſiſtance of Prince
<hi>Waldeck,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who by this time were
got to the Camp, were little enough to keep up the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirits of the Beſiegers, who began to be very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
with the frequent Loſſes they had ſuſtained by the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Place, and the frequent Sallies of the Beſieged;
and the Duke had not his End effected before he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the greateſt Part of the Army to march and fight
the Enemy.</p>
            <p>For on the 1ſt of <hi>Aug.</hi> having received certain Advice,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> Beſiege <hi>Gran.</hi>
               </note>
that the 500 Foot he had detached under Major <hi>Rounkell,</hi> had
happily got into <hi>Gran,</hi> but that the ſame day the Seraſquier
<hi>Baſha,</hi> with an Army of between 50 and 60000 Men had
begun to beſiege that Place; he immediately thereupon called
a Council of War, where many were of Opinion, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Gran</hi> being ſo well provided, that he could eaſily
defend the Town for two Months it were their beſt way vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
to purſue the Siege of <hi>Newheuſel,</hi> and not to meddle
withthe <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army till they had ſomething weakned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
before <hi>Gran:</hi> But the Majority concluded it moſt adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to march with the greateſt part of the Army to fight the
<hi>Turks,</hi> and to leave a ſufficient Body to carry on, at the ſame
time, the Siege of <hi>Newheuſel.</hi> Whereupon an Officer was ſent
to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to acquaint the Emperor with the ſaid Reſolution;
who returned again on the 3d to the Camp, with the Emperor's
Approbation of what they had reſolved on. The Duke, in the
mean time, having ordered ſeveral Retrenchments to be made,
for the greater ſecurity of thoſe that were to be left to
continue the Siege; and they being almoſt finiſhed by the 5th
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he began his March that Day.</p>
            <p>We ſhall at preſent follow the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in his March, and give you an Account of the Iſſue of it, and then return to <hi>Newheuſell. Aug.</hi> 8, he paſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> near <hi>Comorra;</hi>
and next Day reached to <hi>Dotis,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Thaſa;</hi> from
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62930:102"/>
whence his Highneſs, with the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Enemy, with a deſign to Attack them in their Camp
before <hi>Gran<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> if they came not out to fight them. As they
approached nearer, they underſtood how vigorouſly the <hi>Turks</hi>
puſhed on the Siege of <hi>Gran,</hi> and the brave Reſiſtance the
Garriſon continued to make. On the 14th, a Renagado <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
who had for ſome time ſerved the <hi>Turks,</hi> came into the
Imperial Camp, and inform'd the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that the
<hi>Turks</hi> believing the Imperialiſts not above 20000 ſtrong, had
reſolved to Attack them: Upon which Information, the Duke
who was encamped with the Army near a Moraſs which covered
the <hi>Turks,</hi> reſolved to retire that very Night an Hours March,
thereby to confirm the Enemy in their Opinion of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Forces; which being effected in very
good Order, the <hi>Turks,</hi> without loſing any time, paſſed the
Moraſs,<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Gran.</hi>
               </note> thinking to ſurprize the Imperialiſts in their Retreat.
But they were ſtrangely miſtaken, for they found them drawn
up in very good Order; Yet they fell on with their uſual Shouts,
and charged the Right Wing, commanded by the Elector of
<hi>Bavaria;</hi> and afterwards the Left Wing, where the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> was in Perſon; and likewiſe endeavoured to flank
them, but they were beaten off with the greateſt Bravery ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.
With this being ſomewhat diſcouraged, but much
more in that they found themſelves deceived in the Account
they had of the Strength of the Imperialiſts, they began to
fall into great Diſorder, which was very much encreaſed by the
Diſcharge of 30 Pieces of Cannon, laden with Small-ſhot, with
which (the Imperial Troops opening) they fired upon them, and
made a great Slaughter; And at the ſecond Diſcharge they
fled, being purſued by the firſt Line of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and a
great many illuſtrious Voluntiers, who on this Occaſion gave
great Proofs of their Courage. While they repaſſed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files
on the ſide of the Moraſs, the Imperial Troops follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them very cloſe; and cutting in pieces all that oppoſed them,
they entred their Camp, and made themſelves Maſters of it,
where they took all their Tents, Baggage, and Artillory, the
latter conſiſting of 23 Pieces of Cannon, and 4 Mortars; the
Enemy at the ſame time fleeing towards <hi>Buda,</hi> while the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi>
and <hi>Croats,</hi> with a Detachment of Cuiraſſiers and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
commanded by the Baron <hi>de Merci,</hi> the Count <hi>de Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
and Colonel <hi>Heuſler,</hi> were ſent in purſuit of them. This
Victory was ſo much the more ſignal and advantageous to the
Imperialiſts, in that tho' there were 4000 Janiſaries and 2000
Spahi's of the Enemy ſlain, yet it did not coſt the former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
100 Men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vicegrade</hi> taken by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </note> and among them no Perſon of Note,. But
<hi>Vicegrade</hi> had unhappily fallen into the <hi>Turks</hi> Hands before
this; for while the Seraſquier was engaged in the Siege of
<hi>Gran,</hi> (before which he loſt near 3000 Men,) he had ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt, before
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62930:103"/>
the Duke came up, a Detachment of 12000 to Attack it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
then only a Garriſon of 300 <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who yet made a
very brave Defence, till at length, the Enemy having made
a Breach with their Cannon and Mines, they Capitulated to
march out with their Arms and Baggage to the <hi>Danube,</hi> where
they Embarked, and were conducted by Water to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Army 5 while the Enemy thought fit to demoliſh the Place.</p>
            <p>But this was nothing in compariſon of the aforeſaid Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Neuheuſel</hi> taken by Storm.</note>
or the Taking of <hi>Newheuſel,</hi> that followed; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
after this manner; The Beſiegers having made their
Approaches by Galleries, Cannon and Mines ſo far, that a
Breach was made at one of the Baſtions, which was ſo broad,
that 3 Men might enter a breaſt, General <hi>Caprara,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> having called a Council of War thereupon, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to give a general Aſſault the next Day being <hi>Aug.</hi> 19, and
ſent their Commands into all Quarters to provide accordingly:
So that firſt having ſprung 3 Mines about the ſaid Baſtion and
Curtain, which, tho' they had not the deſired Effect ſo as to
ruin ſome Retrenchments of the Beſieged, yet they ſo far bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as to facilitate the Aſſault, by opening a Gap
12 Foot wide, and of a pretty eaſie Aſſent. Hereupon, they
immediately fired upon the Town from all Quarters; which
put the <hi>Turks</hi> within into ſuch a Conſternation, that, for a Time,
ſcarce a Man durſt appear; ſo that laying hold of the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
whilſt they played alſo with their Bombs and Carcaſſes
upon the Beſieged, the Count of <hi>Scherffenburg</hi> was the firſt that
entred the Place, on the Right ſide of the Baſtion; The Sieur
<hi>Ronimel</hi> at the ſame time puſhing in at the new Breache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, a little
on the Left; General <hi>Dumont,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Lunem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers,</hi>
vigorouſly backing the Aſſault. This Vigour of the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> brought the Beſieged to ſet up two white Flags upon
their Retrenchments; but the former were now ſo eager, that
there was no bridling of them, ſo that they immediately mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the new Retrenchments, and after a little Oppoſition, the
Imperialiſts ruſhed all into the Town, putting all they found to
the Sword. <hi>Haſſan,</hi> the Baſha was brought deſperately wounded,
to General <hi>Caprara;</hi> and about 10 Officers more were Saved.
Beſides the great quantity of Ammunitition and Proviſions they
found there, they had alſo 75 pieces of Cannon; which Cannon
they had all diſmounted ſave 6. Of this Succeſs the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> was advertiſed, as he was upon his March from <hi>Gran,</hi>
with an Intention to put the finiſhing Hand to it himſelf; which
made him alter his Motion, and go in queſt of the Enemies
Army, who rallied about <hi>Buda;</hi> and whom he could not draw to
a ſecond Engagement during the reſt of the Campaign. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he had done in <hi>Hungary</hi> ſo much already, that the Seraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier
thought fit, towards the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to ſend an
Aga to his Highneſs; who, after having kiſſed his Hands, and

            <p>After this, the Aga prayed His Highneſs to contribute all he could on his part towards the putting an End to a War which had cauſed the Effuſion of ſo much Blood, and had been
the Ruine of ſo many poor People; and ſaying, That he
thought His Highneſs, after ſo glorious a Campaign, ought
the more readily to conſent to a Peace; and offering, in the
Grand Seignior's Name, to abandon Count <hi>Tekely,</hi> and even
to deliver to the Emperor the Hoſtages he had now at the
Port. To this the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> anſwered, That a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
Army was not to be amuſed with Overtures of Peace;
and that he had no Inſtructions to hearken to any; But that
he would acquaint His Imperial Majeſty with the Seraſquier
Propoſals. And ſo we leave this Matter at preſent, and
ſee what the <hi>Cermans</hi> have been doing in other Places all this

            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:62930:104"/>
For if the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with the grand Army, was thus
active in <hi>Hungary,</hi> General <hi>Leſley,</hi> in <hi>Croatia,</hi> was not idle on
his ſide neither; For, having formed a Deſign againſt <hi>Eſſeck,</hi>
he left his heavy Cannon and Baggage at <hi>Virovitza,</hi> and on
the 9th of <hi>Aug.</hi> directed his March towards <hi>Monſtarocina,</hi>
where he arrived on the 10th; and that Evening he detached
500 <hi>Croats,</hi> and ſome Foot, to inveſt <hi>Michalowitz,</hi> wherein
were 60 <hi>Turks</hi> only, who immediately ſurrender'd at Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and into which Place the General having put 200 Men,
he continued his March towards <hi>Caraniſſa,</hi> while the <hi>Turks</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made ſeveral Signals from the Caſtles they had near the
<hi>Drave,</hi> and ſent out Parties to alarm thoſe of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> made
the Baſha of that Place to advance with 600 Horſe to charge
the Count's Van-guard. He bravely repulſed him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to retire with conſiderable Loſs; ſo that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
by the 14th, was got into the great Plain, not far from
<hi>Eſſeck,</hi> when he diſcovered a Body of about 1000 <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Horſe; but their Foot, whoſe Number the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> could
not exactly obſerve, were poſted nearer the Town. This
made him immediately draw up his Troops in Battalia, and
command the <hi>Croats</hi> of the 2 Wings to advance, and charge
the Enemy; which they did with that Reſolution, that the
<hi>Turks</hi> fell preſently into Diſorder, and ſoon after fled; the
Foot at the ſame time making all the haſte they could to get
into the Town and Caſtle. Hereupon, the Count gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to his Troops to attack the Town; which they perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with wonderful Courage, ſcaling the Walls, which were of
no great Defence, and entring the Place with their Swords in
their Hands; the <hi>Turks</hi> all this while endeavouring to ſave
themſelves, with their Wives and Children; ſome by Water,
others by endeavouring to get into the Caſtle; when of the
former, many were taken in little Boats. The General gave
the Pillage of the Town to the Soldiers; and having poſted
Guards to ſecure the Avenues of the Caſtle, he went to view
the Bridge, which was 80000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paces in length on the other
ſide of the <hi>Drave,</hi> and 1100 Paces on this ſide, and 12 broad;
but he found the <hi>Turks</hi> had broken down part of it on the
other ſide of the River, to hinder the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> purſuing them,
and that it would be very difficult to burn it; therefore he
contented himſelf to burn that part of it which ſtood on this
ſide the <hi>Drave,</hi> which was quite deſtroyed: And having thus
executed his Deſign, with the Loſs of no more than 60 Men,
he returned to <hi>Michalowitz,</hi> to refreſh his Troops, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a further Re-inforcement, in order to go upon ſome new
Adventure: But ſoon after he happening to fall ſick, and the
<hi>Turks,</hi> by this laſt Loſs, provoked to a greater Vigilance, there
was nothing further of moment performed that Way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:62930:104"/>
But as for <hi>Vpper Hungary,</hi> what General <hi>Schultz</hi> failed in
laſt Year, he was reſolved to perform this: And therefore, one
of the firſt Things he did,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſperies</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by General <hi>Schultz.</hi>
               </note> was, to ſet down before <hi>Eſperies;</hi>
by taking whereof, he did not queſtion but to ſtraighten the
Bounds of the Rebel-Party, and enlarge thoſe of the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
very much; But he found it an harder Task to reduce the
Place than he was aware of: For, tho' after many Days Siege,
he gave Notice to the Burghers of the Emperor's general Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
that was lately publiſhed; and that it was now high
time for them to think of indemnifying themſelves; and that
ſuch an Opportunity, if let ſlip, was not to be retrieved; yet
they were ſo far from taking the Advantage of it, that they fell
upon the Officer ſent to them upon that Account, whom they
barbarouſly murthered; which ſo enraged the General, that
he commanded the Town to be ſtormed. But the Beſieged
made ſo deſperate a Defence, that the <hi>Germans,</hi> after a Fight
of 2 Hours and an half, and the Loſs of about 300 Men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
in expectation of a Re-inforcement from the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
in order to perfect the Work. But before that was done,
and ſomewhat to the Surprize of the General, the Governour
of the Town ſent to deſire a Parly, it being the 10th of <hi>Sept.</hi>
and a Ceſſation of Hoſtilities till next Morning, that he might
in the mean time call together the Inhabitants, to deliberate
with them concerning the Articles to Surrender. The General
believing his Deſign therein was to gain Time, he would not
grant it; but demanded to have 2 Officers immediately ſent
to him for Hoſtages: This the Beſieged would not agree to,
and ſo on the Firing went on both ſides.<note place="margin">Surrendred.</note> But the next
Day, the Governour underſtanding the Beſiegers would in a
few Days be re-inforced with the afore-mentioned Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
deſired another Parley; wherein, after a little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
the Terms were agreed on, and the Town actually
put into the <hi>Germans</hi> Hands on the 12th. Now, if the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts
valued themſelves much upon the Advantages
that would accrue to them by the Taking in of <hi>Eſperies,</hi>
the Conſequences of it, perhaps, exceeded far their own
Expectations: For, beſides, <hi>Tokay, Potock, Onotz,</hi> and divers
other Places, which quickly fell into their Hands, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Caſchaw</hi> was alſo taken by General <hi>Caprara; Agria</hi>
bombarded by the Baron <hi>de Merci;</hi> and all the Country
round it ravaged and deſtroyed; and then the Troops
went into their Winter-Quarters, the Bounds whereof they
had conſiderably enlarged in that part of <hi>Hungary</hi> this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.</p>
            <p>I have nothing to ſay concerning the Feats of the <hi>Poles</hi> this Seaſon, unleſs it be, that they did ſuffer their Provinces of <hi>Podolia,</hi> &amp;c. to be ravaged by the <hi>Tartars;</hi> came themſelves

            <p>But the <hi>Venetians</hi> made far better Work of it;<note place="margin">The Siege and Battel of <hi>Coron.</hi>
               </note> for, after conſiderable Preparations made, and divers Conſultations had, at length the Captain-General <hi>Franciſco Moroſini,</hi> conſidering

the Republick, ſet ſail in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> for that Place;
But ſcarce had the <hi>Venetians</hi> approached the Place, when a
great Body of <hi>Turks</hi> came down from the Country, and took
their Lodgments within Piſtol-ſhot of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> which
wonderfully animated the Beſieged, who were already of
themſelves ſufficiently bent to make an obſtinate Reſiſtance,
eſpecially conſidering the Advantages they had by the ſteep
and difficult Situation of the Town, the Abundance of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and Ammunition they were ſtored with, beſides their own
Strength and Number, which was very conſiderable: And,
indeed, to ſay the Truth of them, the Beſieged, and <hi>Turks</hi>
without, acted for the Preſervation of the Place, whatever
might be expected from deſperate and brave Men. They at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
ſeveral times to become Maſters of a Bonnet, which
commanded the <hi>Venetian</hi> Camp, but they were ſtil repulſed,
though it retarded the Beſiegers, and was an Hindrance for
them to carry on their Works: Then the General ſprung a
Mine, wherein were an 100 Barrels of Powder, which was
perform'd on the 24th of <hi>July;</hi> but it had not the deſired
Effect, quite contrary to the Hopes of the Succeſs of this
Work, which ſo encouraged the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they broke into
the <hi>Venetian</hi> Lines to gain their deſired Object, the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Bonnet: Yet, when they thought themſelves ſecure of
it, the General poured in upon them a good Body of Horſe
and Dragoons, which being ſeconded by the <hi>Malteſe</hi> Forces,
attack'd them at the very Entrance of the Bonnet, with ſo
much Reſolution and Valour for the Space of 3 Hours, during
which time the Combate very obſtinately laſted; that at laſt
the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces replanted their White Colours upon the
Place; the <hi>Turks</hi> that were driven from it end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avouring to
ſhelter themſelves under the Covert of the adjacent Trees,
but that Place was quickly made too hot to hold them alſo.
They loſt in the whole of their Number 400, and had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wounded; but the <hi>Venetians</hi> had not above 130 killed and
wounded in all on their ſide; and even to ſweeten that Loſs,
they got by the Action ſeveral rich Spoils; and, amongſt other
Things, 17 Standards. When they returned into their
Trenches, they expoſed 130 <hi>Turks</hi> Heads to the View of the
Beſieged, thinking thereby to terrifie them into a Surrender;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut, for all this, they continued nothing leſs obſtinate in the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62930:105"/>
Defence of the Place; which provoked the <hi>Venetians,</hi> on the
other hand, to give them more terrible Effects of their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and Power, by the moſt furious Diſcharge of their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
Bombs, and Stones upon them; while at the ſame time,
which was <hi>July</hi> 30, the <hi>Turks</hi> rallied again after their Flight,
their Strength being conſiderably augmented by a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Soldiers they had drawn together from all Parts of the
<hi>Morea,</hi> and by the Forces of the Captain-Baſha, and attempted
a ſecond time, with greater Fury than before, to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the <hi>Venetian</hi> Trenches; yet they were bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed,
and encountred with a Shower of Musket-ſhot and
Granadoes, ſo that they were forced not only to retreat, but
were purſued by Col. <hi>Bianchli</hi>'s Regiments, with 200 Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
to their own Retrenchments, with the Loſs of 400
Men; which was ſo much the more heightned, in that a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Ball
took off <hi>Kalil</hi> Baſha, Viſier Commander General of
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army. However, all theſe Diſadvantages would
not abate the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pride, and bring them to yield; for they
knew ſtill where to be recrulted with freſh Troops, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not daily to diſturb the <hi>Venetians</hi> in their Trenches:
Which Obſtinacy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> together with the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
being in this manner from within and without much harraſſed
with continual Action, greatly leſſened their Numbers; ſo
that the General ſaw plainly there was no lingring on the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but that either he muſt make ſome bold Attempt, or draw
off: Wherefore, having firſt ruminated it in himſelf, he then
propoſed the Deſign to a Council of War; which was, To
adventure to force the Enemies Camp; and which, perhaps,
contrary to his Expectation, was approved of by them: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
he drew out of the Gallies 1500 Voluntiers, who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of Lieutenant-General <hi>Magnani,</hi> landed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Midnight; and next Day, being <hi>Aug.</hi> 7, 1200 of them
filed off to the Left of the Enemies Retrenchments by the
Entrance of a Valley, the reſt of them at the ſame time mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to the Right, while ſome other Troops were held in a
Readineſs to follow their Motions, and give them ſpeedy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
as Neceſſity required, in order to favour and promote
the Deſign.</p>
            <p>The Twilight of the next Morning being come, 2 Barrels of Powder were fired as a Signal, which was immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a Diſcharge of all the Cannon, and furious Salvo's
of all the Musketeers, with a continual firing both on the Front
and Flank of the Enemies Camp; which brisk and unexpected
Aſſault, put the <hi>Turks</hi> into very great Diſorder, and the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of them began to flinch and give back, without being able
to be heartned up by the Example of the moſt undaunted, or
Commands of their Officers; So that the <hi>Venetians</hi> finding
ſuch weak Reſiſtance, they fell on with the greater Fury, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62930:106"/>
made a great Slaughter among the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſcare any eſcaping
their Swords, and all this with little Loſs to themſelves. They
found alſo in the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp, a very rich Booty of Artillery,
Arms, Ammunition and Proviſion, with about 300 Horſes,
Tents, Standards, and 6 Braſs Guns, 3 whereof were marked
with St. <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> beſides the Imperial Standard adorned
with 3 Horſe-Tails. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> after ſo fortunate an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
finding themſelves free from the great Obſtacles of
the <hi>Turks</hi> that were encamped without the Walls, and now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Field, were big with Hopes of ſoon putting the
Beſieged out of all Thoughts of further Defence; wherefore
they prepared for a general Aſſault, and for that End ſprung
a Mine, whoſe Effect was to bring them to an Attack, which
laſted for 3 Hours together, the Beſieged withſtanding them
with incredible Valour and Oppoſition, fatal to a great many
Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> and Valiant Soldiers, who periſhed there:
This conſiderable Loſs gave a few Moments breathing to the
Attack; but the Courage wherewith they fell on afreſh, made
the Beſieged ſee it high time to think of a Capitulation, which
they made a Sign of, by hanging out a White Standard upon
the Ramparts; whereupon Arms were laid down, in order to
regulate the Articles: But this was only an Artifice of <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Perfidy, to make a feigned ſhew of Rendition, with a real De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to procure a greater Loſs to the Beſiegers, by a brisk and
unexpected Sally; which ſo incenſed the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that they
took a firmer Reſolution than ever, to put an end to the Siege,
which had already continued 49 Days;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coron</hi> taken.</note> wherefore, having
firſt ſwept the Ramparts with their Shot, they bravely mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Walls, and entred the Town, where being heated, as
they were with the Baſeneſs of the Enemy, and the Aſſault
they were now engaged in, they made a dreadful Slaughter of
all the Inhabitants, without diſtinction either of Age or Sex.
They found in the Place 128 Pieces of Cannon, whereof 66
were Braſs, beſides a great Quantity of Ammunition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.</p>
            <p>This Work being now at laſt happily accompliſhed by the Captain-General, after he had ſtaid ſo long at <hi>Coron,</hi> till the Fortifications were ſo far repaired, as to make the Place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,
he reſolved to do all he could to encourage the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Province of <hi>Maina,</hi> in the Diſpoſition they appear'd
to be, to caſt off the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Yoak: And, to that Purpoſe,
ſent the <hi>Mainots,</hi> who came in to him upon the Taking of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou,</hi>
with ſome other Troops, to attack <hi>Zarnata,</hi> one of the
ſtrongeſt of the 3 Fortreſſes built by the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſince the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
War, to keep thoſe People in awe. And ſome Days after,
having cauſed the Army to embark, the whole Fleet ſet ſail
from <hi>Coron,</hi> and the next Day arrived at <hi>Chitie,</hi> about 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Miles
from <hi>Zarnata,</hi> where they were joined by the Ships that had
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62930:106"/>
on Board the <hi>Saxon</hi> Troops, conſiſting of 3000 Men; and
from whence the Fleet ſailed towards <hi>Calamata,</hi> near which
Place the Forces landed again. However, all theſe Motions
could not be managed with that Expedition and Secreſie, but
that the Captain Baſha having notice thereof, he diſpatched
aſhoar what Men he could, out of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies, which he
left at <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> ſecuring the Port with great Chains;
and, being joined by a great Body of Horſe and Foot, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards <hi>Calamata,</hi> to keep the <hi>Mainotes</hi> from revolting to
the <hi>Venetians.</hi> This the Captain-General had no ſooner No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, but he ſent an Officer to the Garriſon of <hi>Zarnata,</hi> to
let them know, that if they did not immediately ſurrender the
Place, they muſt expect to be treated in the ſame Manner they
of <hi>Coron</hi> had been: Whereupon the Garriſon deſired that
they might ſend to the Captain Baſha, to acquaint him with
the Condition they were in, which was granted. But the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
not returning at the time appointed, they gave up the
Place on the 11th of <hi>Sept.</hi> the Men marching away with Bag
and Baggage; yet the Aga, who commanded them, fearing
he ſhould be ill treated by the Captain Baſha, ſtaid in the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
Camp, towards which the Baſha was now advanced, at
the Head of 10000 Men, with a Reſolution to fight the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi>
which the Captain-General <hi>Moroſini</hi> did not decline on
his part. For he marched towards the Enemy, feigning at the
ſame time to make a Deſcent, to give them a Diverſion in ſome
other Place; For which Purpoſe he had cauſed ſome Troops
to embark, and commanded the Fleet to keep along the Coaſt.
The <hi>Venetians,</hi> who came up with the Enemy on the 14th,
were drawn up in Battalia by General <hi>Degenfield,</hi> on an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Ground: The <hi>Turks,</hi> on the other ſide, having put
themſelves into a Poſture to receive them, their Horſe fell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
upon the <hi>Venetians</hi> Left Wing, while a great Body
of their Foot at the ſame time advanced towards their Right,
at the Head of which was the Prince of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> but they
found ſo brave a Reſiſtance, that they were forced to retire;
yet they preſently after returned, and charged a ſecond time
with greater Fury than before. The Fight was maintained
with great Courage and Reſolution on both ſides for a time,
till at laſt the <hi>Turks</hi> being no longer able to keep their Ground,
fell into Diſorder, and ſoon after diſperſed and fled, leaving
a great Number of their Men ſlain behind them, and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of <hi>Calamata</hi> to fire the Magazine, and abandon the Place,
which the <hi>Venetians</hi> immediately took Poſſeſſion of; as they
did ſoon after of <hi>Porto Vitulo,</hi> which the <hi>Mainotes</hi> took for
them: Of <hi>Chielifa,</hi> a ſtrong Fortreſs not far from the other,
Place, and <hi>Paſſavania;</hi> whereby the Republick became poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
of the whole Province of <hi>Mayna,</hi> whereof the Captain-General
made Seignior <hi>Lorenzo Venier</hi> Governour; and ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62930:107"/>
ended this Campaign. And I ſhall end this Year with
taking Notice, that it was fatal to the Liberty of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<hi>Gallican</hi> Church, the Edicts of <hi>Nants</hi> and <hi>Niſmes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
utterly revoked by another of the 22th of <hi>Oct.</hi> and thoſe
made null and finite, which were looked upon irrevocable
and perpetual; the Conſequence whereof all the World has
ſeen and heard, and therefore I ſhall ſay nothing of it in this
place.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1686</label> We have left <hi>England</hi> laſt with the King's Diſſolving his Parliament,  now it is time to ſee a little how he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. His Brother had laid the Foundation of making a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> by hectoring and making Bargains with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
to give up their Charters, and take new ones
from him; wherein he reſerved a Power, that if they did not
return ſuch Members as pleaſed him, he would reſume the
Charters he granted them, and herein he made a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs:
But his Keeper and Attorney-General refuſed to grant
Patents to ſuch poor Corporations, as could not pay their Fees,
at length the Keeper having kickt up his Heels laſt Year, and
<hi>Jefferies</hi> advanced to be Lord Chancellor, and the Attorney
turned out, with another put into his Place that would with
greater Charity perform the Office; theſe Remora's to the
King's Deſigns were removed; Yet there was another Pace to be
made ſtill, which was to make the Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi>
to murder the Common Law, as well as the King and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſigned to murder the Parliament by it ſelf. To this
End his good Majeſty, before he would make any Judges,
would enter into a Bargain with them, that they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the King's Power of diſpenſing with the Penal Laws and
Teſts, made againſt Recuſants out of Parliament: However,
it was ſaid, the King ſtumbled at the Threſhold, for beginning
with Sir <hi>Thomas Jones,</hi> who had deſerved ſo well in Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>
his Tryal and others; he boggl'd very much at it, ſaying plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he could not do it; to which the King anſwered, <hi>He would
have Twelve Judges of his Opinion;</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> replied, <hi>He
might have</hi> 12 <hi>Judges of his Opinion, but would ſcarce find Twelve
Lawyers to be ſo.</hi> But for all this the King went on, and would
gain his Point in favour of Diſſenters, at leaſtwiſe, as to the
gaining his Prerogative in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> and when he
thought he had gone pretty far that way, he granted a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, which yet was not opened till
the 3d of <hi>Aug.</hi> though it had been Sealed ſome Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But at laſt out it came; and, whereas I have never yet
ſeen it Printed but once, and leſt the ſame ſhould be forgotten,
I ſhall inſert it in this place; and it runs in the following Terms.</p>

            <p>Its not ſo eaſie, perhaps, at firſt ſight, to diſcern the Flaws and Deficiences included in this Commiſſion, neither ſhall I rake further into it, only I'll obſerve with a Learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
Firſt, The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in it, refuſed to Act, ſo that the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> was
put in, though not in the firſt Place: Secondly, How unwarily it
was it drawn, for, though it was to be thought, every one
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62930:110"/>
underſtood the Deſign of the Commiſſion was to introduce a
Roman Hierarchy, which aſſumes a Power over the Temporal,
in order to the Spiritual Good, yet that Commiſſion, granted
the Temporal Power, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord Chancellor, and any
other two, <hi>viz.</hi> Lord Treaſurer, Preſident, or Lord Chief
Juſtice, a Power of Excommunication, which is a pure Spiritual
Act.</p>
            <p>This Commiſſion thus granted and opened, the firſt Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it fell upon the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe pretended Crime was, That by Virtue of the King's Letter, he did not
ſuſpend Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Norwich,</hi> now Archbiſhop of
<hi>York,</hi> for Preaching a Sermon in his Pariſh-Church of St. <hi>Giles,</hi>
againſt the Frauds and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by
a Power as Arbitrary as that by which the Commiſſioners act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But though the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> might be ſufficiently incenſed
againſt the Biſhop for his Non-compliance herein, the King
had another Cauſe of Offence with his Lordſhip; for, when
the Lords in the laſt Parliament had Voted an Addreſs of
Thanks to the King, as I have already noted, for his Speech,
the Biſhop moved in his own and his Brethren's Name, that
the Houſe might debate the King's Speech, which, as it was
extraordinary and unuſual in the Houſe, ſo it was no leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
to the King and Court, who now dreaded the Lords
would concur with the Commons in their Addreſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued
this Pace to be a Piece of Preſumption in the Biſhop,
for which, in due time, he ſhould be ſure to be remembred;
and ſo, indeed, it happened: For notwithſtanding the Biſhops
juſt Plea before the Commiſſioners in his own Defence, and
that <hi>Jefferies,</hi> the Mouth of them, had in a manner nothing elſe
to ſay, but, <hi>Muſt not the King be obeyed? Muſt not the King be
obeyed?</hi> As if a Man was bound to hang himſelf, if the
King commanded it, yet they ſuſpended him <hi>ab Officio,</hi>
where we leave him at preſent, and proceed to ſhew you
the further Effects of this goodly Commiſſion,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> choſen Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Collede.</note> when there was
the leaſt Opportunity to put it in Execution. You muſt
know, the Preſidentſhip of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College in <hi>Oxford</hi> falling
vacant about this time, and the Fellows, fearing a <hi>Mandamus</hi>
would be impoſed upon them, for ſome Perſon or other not
qualified by their Statutes, and whom by their Oaths they
could not ſubmit to, choſe Dr. <hi>Hough,</hi> a Perſon every way
qualified for their Preſident; which was no ſooner done, but
the King ſent them a Peremptory <hi>Mandamus,</hi> to make choice
of the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> for their Preſident, who, as being not
qualified by their Statutes, they rejected, and in an humble An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
excuſed themſelves, as being otherwiſe obliged, as well
by their Oaths as Statutes, with which the King was ſo Angry,
and uſed ſuch Expreſſions upon the Occaſion, as were never,
perhaps, before uſed by a Prince. But finding his harſh Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62930:110"/>
could not frighten the Fellows out of their Duty, he
ſent his Commiſſioners of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs among them,
to turn them out of their Fellowſhips,<note place="margin">The Fellows of <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> College turn'd out.</note> to which they had as
much Right as any other Man to his Eſtate. But the good
Commiſſioners were ſo far from boggling at this, that they yet
went further, and by a new ſtrain of Tyranny, never practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
but by Abſolute Tyrants, made the Fellows uncapable of
any other Eccleſiaſtical Preferments, and a Seminary of Jeſuits
and Popiſh Prieſts were introduced into their rooms, as much
to the Subvertion of the Eſtabliſhed Church, as the Statutes of
the College.</p>
            <p>While Things were thus carried on with an high Hand, by Virtue of this extraordinary Commiſſion, you cannot think they were more moderate in the Adminiſtration of ordinary
Juſtice in the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Courts; you know how ſeverely <hi>Oats</hi>
was treated for diſcovering the Popiſh Plot.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dangerfield</hi> Sentenced and kill'd.</note> Now comes <hi>Thomas
Dangerfield</hi>'s Turn, for his diſcovering of the Meal-Tub-Plot,
but with a worſe-Fate; For this Man having in King <hi>Charles</hi>
his Time, in his Depoſitions before the Parliament, reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he was imploy'd by the Popiſh Party, and chiefly by
the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> to kill the
King, and that he was incouraged, and promiſed Impunity and
Reward, and part of it given him by the D. of <hi>York</hi> for that
End, he was now proſecuted upon a <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> and
as Juries went, found guilty, and had the ſame Sentence of
Whipping with <hi>Oats:</hi> But in his return from <hi>Tyburn</hi> towards
<hi>Newgate</hi> after his Whipping, he was run into the Eye with a
Tuck at the end of a Cane, by one <hi>Robert Francis,</hi> a Red-hot
Papiſt, of which, with the Agony of the Whipping, he ſoon
after died: But his Body was ſo ſwoln and martyred with his
Whipping, that it was a Queſtion whether he died of that, or
of the Wound in his Eye, for which <hi>Francis</hi> however was juſtly
Hanged, the King thinking it would appear to be too baſe a
Partiality to pardon him for ſo foul a Fact.</p>
            <p>Much about the ſame time,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note> Mr. <hi>Sam.

Bench, Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> being Lord Chief Juſtice, to ſtand
3 times in the Pillory, and to be Whipped from <hi>Newgate</hi> to
<hi>Tyburn,</hi> which was ſeverely Executed, without any regard to

                        <p>Is it in the Name of God, and for his Service that you have joined your ſelves with Papiſts, which will, indeed, fight for the Maſs-book, but burn the Bible, and who ſeek to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate

they cannot do it with their own, and will you be aiding and

our Children in Popery? How can you do theſe Things, and
yet call your ſelves Proteſtants?</p>

them to make a forcible Entry into the Houſes of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men,
under the Name of Quartering, directly contrary
to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Petition of Right? Will you be

(if there had been any need of it) for it was very well

This Addreſs is ſo plain, as to need no Remark upon it;
and therefore,<note place="margin">K. <hi>James</hi>'s Letter to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Parliament.</note> I ſhall only tell you, before I paſs to Foreign
Affairs, that Colonel <hi>Talbot,</hi> formerly mentioned, was doing
what he would all this time in <hi>Ireland,</hi> while the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
had ſettled Affairs ſo in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when he was High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,
(and now <hi>Argyle</hi> was cut off) that he did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but to carry on his Deſigns more bare-faced there, than
he had done in <hi>England:</hi> And therefore, tho' he did not call a
Parliament in that Kingdom till <hi>April,</hi> this Year, yet, in his
Letter to them, he took no notice at all of the Proteſtant
Diſſenters, but recommended to them his innocent Roman
Catholick Subjects, who had, with their Lives and Fortunes,
been always aſſiſtant to the Crown in the worſt Rebellions and
Uſurpations, though they lay under Diſcouragements hardly
to be named. Theſe he heartily recommended to their Care,
to the End, that as they had given good Experience of their
true Loyalty, and peaceable Behaviour, ſo, by their Aſſiſtance,
they might have the Protection of his Laws, and that Security
under his Government which others of his Subjects had, not
ſuffering them to lie under Obligations, which their Religion
could not admit of; by doing whereof, they would give a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the Duty and Affection they had to him, and
do him moſt acceptable Service: And this Love he expected
they would ſhew to their Brethren, as they ſaw he was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
Father to them all. This was very kind, indeed, on
the King's part, to thoſe of his own Religion; and in this
kind Mood we will leave him at preſent, and proſecute a little
the mighty Affairs of the Campaigns abroad, where their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were doing much better Feats than ours in <hi>England,</hi>
whoſe greateſt Talent was Curſing and Swearing, and Riding

with the ill Succeſs of it, the preceding Year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1684, but
come to tell you, That the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> having joined the
Imperial Army in <hi>June,</hi> marched now again towards <hi>Buda,</hi>
and by the 21ſt in the Morning, the Imperialiſts began their
Approaches at about 500 Yards diſtance from the Walls of the
<hi>Lower Buda,</hi> making uſe upon this Occaſion, of their old
Trenches, and continued their Works all that Day, and the
following Night, tho' with conſiderable Difficulty from the
Badneſs of the Earth, and the Enemies firing out of the Town,
from whence a <hi>Pole,</hi> taken at the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> made his
Eſcape with the Baſha's Horſe, 2 Scymiters, and his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Staff,
who reported to the General; That their coming
before <hi>Buda</hi> was very ſurprizing, that the Garriſon was not near
ſo ſtrong as when it was beſieged before; and that the <hi>Turks</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:62930:112"/>
had Intelligence, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had formed a Deſign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Alba Regalis</hi> and <hi>Erla;</hi> which was true in Fact; for it was
not concluded to attempt <hi>Buda</hi> till the 20th of <hi>June,</hi> at a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council of War hold at <hi>Comorra.</hi> And 2 Days after the
<hi>Pole,</hi> came a Janizary out of the Town alſo, and ſurrender'd
himſelf, upon a Dream he had had the Night before, that the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> would become Maſters of the Place, and put all the
Sword, as they had done laſt Year at <hi>Neuheuſel;</hi> and that if
he fled to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> he might find Merty: Adding withal,
that the Garriſon was not above 6000 ſtrong. This Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
made the <hi>Germans</hi> re-double their Diligence; ſo that
the ſame Day, with a Battery of 6 Pieces of Cannon, which
they had raiſed, they made a Breach in the Wall of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Town, (which was 5 Foot thick,) of about 15 Paces; which
made the <hi>Turks</hi> fear an Aſſault that very Night, and they
prepared for it accordingly, but it was deferred till the Day
following; when, after the Baſha's Women, and about 10000
Pounds in Money, had been taken as going by Water, from
the Town to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> there were a Party of Granadeers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to diſcover whether the Breach were acceſſible, or
not; which, upon their Report of its being ſo, was ſtormed
at Night, with ſuch Confuſion, that if the <hi>Turks</hi> had kept their
Poſts, they might have cut off all the Aſſailants: But they
were ſo far from that, that they not only retired into the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Town, and by their Proceedings, did not think themſelves
ſecure there neither, for they made a Fire againſt the <hi>New
Port,</hi> that they might ſee if the <hi>Germans</hi> attempted any thing
by <hi>Petard.</hi> This the <hi>Germans</hi> did not do, but only contented
themſelves to make a Lodgment upon the Breach. From the
25th to the 29th, the Beſiegers were (buſie in raiſing more
Batteries, and making a Line of Communication between the
Lodgment and the Angle of the Wall looking into St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Valley; which they finiſhed, and placed 4 Mortars there, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
the <hi>Turks,</hi> in 2 ſeveral brisk Sallies, endeavoured
to hinder them, and in their continual firing from the Town all
manner of deſtructive Inſtruments upon them; yet this did
not hinder the Beſiegers by the 1ſt of <hi>July,</hi> to raiſe a Battery
to fire upon the Angle of the Round Tower, which looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Valley, and to carry on their Trenches, by
the Help of that and another Battery, ſo as to take in a <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Moſque; from whence they returned with an Angle and Parallel
Line with <hi>Buda,</hi> till they came to the Right-hand Way lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the North Part, at which the 3 Lines met, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of a Wall and a deep Road, under which the Beſiegers
were covered, who now mounted 4 Mortars more, with which
they continually played upon the Town. Their Cannon alſo
by this time, had made a conſiderable Breach, which, by their
advancing another Line from the Place where the 3 Lines
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62930:112"/>
met, ſo as to flank the outermoſt of them, and join the Wall
of the old Town looking into St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Valley, (where they
made a Place of Arms capable to hold about 300 Men,) they
now, by the 4th, were got within 50 Paces of it, where they
covered themſelves from the Enemies Fire. The <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers</hi>
the ſame Day arriving in the Camp, they took up
their Quarters to the Left of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and advanced 2 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
Lines, to communicate with the others by the next
Morning. The Town in the mean time was ſet on fire the
Night before, and a great part of it burnt down before the
Fire could be quenched; which yet did not apparently diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the <hi>Turks,</hi> who on the 9th made a great Sally, and did
conſiderable Damage to the Beſiegers; but they were at laſt
repulſed: And tho' on the 13th the Duke commanded a
Lodgment to be made on the Breach, yet the Enemy ſtood ſo
bravely to it, that it could not be effected; and the Beſiegers
in that Attack, loſt near 1000 Soldiers, beſides Officers, and
50 Voluntiers, whereof were ſeveral Noblemen, and, among
others, divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of Quality. However, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
the Siege obſtinately, and made a conſiderable Progreſs
therein by the 22th, when the <hi>Turks</hi> ſallied out upon the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varian</hi>
Quarter, and did conſiderable Execution, nailing up a
Battery of Cannon and 2 Mortars, and then retired with little
Loſs: But about an Hour after, the Enemies principal Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
blew up, which ſtood near the Caſtle that looks towards
<hi>Pest,</hi> by which a great part of the Wall was demoliſhed;
which, upon the viewing of it, ſeemed ſo great to many of the
Generals, that they were for ſtorming the Place, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.
This the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> did not think yet practicable,
but ſent next Day a threatning Summons to the Governour
to ſurrender; who anſwered, in ſhort, <hi>That he thought His
Highneſs would juſtifie him, that he had hitherto done like a brave
Man; and that he was reſolved to continue ſo doing, and that God
puniſheth the Vain-glorious.</hi> Hereupon the Duke ordered a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Aſſault to be made on the 27th; and, after much Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and obſtinate fighting on each ſide, the <hi>Germans</hi> fixed
their Lodgment upon the firſt Wall, and prepared their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Approaches: On the 30th they ſent another Summons
to ſurrender; which was anſwered the Day following, in a
Letter to the General, wherein the Beſieged let him know, <hi>That
the Town was in the Hands of GOD, and that they could not give it
up; but if they would receive another Place in lieu of it, they
would treat thereupon.</hi> The Duke not ſatisfied herewith, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
2 Mines to be ſprung under the ſecond Wall, but they had
not the deſired Succeſs: However, that Evening the Enemy
ſent two Meſſengers to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſent them 2 Hoſtages, and the firing ceaſed on both
ſides; The Baſha propoſing to ſurrender the Town, if they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62930:113"/>
would conclude a Peace upon it, which he ſaid he had Power
to do: But the Elector anſwering, That he had no ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
but that he would do what Service he could towards
the furthering of one; the Firing was renewed.</p>
            <p>On the 3d of <hi>Aug.</hi> the Beſiegers made a general Aſſault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſecond Wall, but came off with conſiderable Loſs; and they were alſo allarmed about this time with the Noiſe of the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Succours that were marching up; which, indeed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Reality, and that before the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> made any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Progreſs more in the Siege, tho' they attempted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
general Aſſault on the 12th; For, the very next Day, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Evening, the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> received certain Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that the Enemy, to the Number of 90000 Men, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
towards his Camp, with a reſolute Deſign to force one
of his Quarters, and to put Succours into the Town. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Buda.</hi>
               </note>
in Concert with the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> he cauſed all the
Horſe and Foot to march out of the Lines, except 20000 Men
that were left to continue the Attacks, and guard the ſeveral
Poſts and Avenues of the Camp, and drew up the Army in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Battel. Next Day, being the 14th of <hi>Aug.</hi> he being
informed, that the Grand Viſier had detached from his Army
a Body of 6000 Janizaries, and 4000 Spahi's, all choſen Men,
who deſcending from the Hills, to the Plain, which ſeparated
his Camp from the <hi>Germans,</hi> had paſſed it without Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and gained the Hills which commanded the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi>
Lines on the Right; and perceiving the Grand Viſier's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was to force a Paſſage into the Town that way, while
himſelf drew up his Army in the Plain to attack the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
Left Wing, or in caſe they failed therein, to retrench
themſelves upon the Hills, and from thence to incommode the
<hi>German</hi> Camp with their Cannon; He kept the main Body of
his Troops to oppoſe thoſe of the Grand Viſier, and about 7
Regiments of Horſe, with ſome few <hi>Hungarians,</hi> to make head
againſt the Detachment upon the Hills, who entertained the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> with ſeveral Vollies of their Cannon; and the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries
made ſo furious a Fire upon them, that the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
and <hi>Croats,</hi> who had the Van-guard, fell into diſorder.
Upon this, the Regiment of <hi>Taffe</hi> advancing, came timely to
their Aſſiſtance, and, with the Help of the other Horſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Enemy-headlong down the Hill, with ſo great Fury
and Slaughter, that near 3000 of the Janizaries were ſlain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Spot; and the reſt choſe rather to retire towards the
Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> than re-join their main Army. The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
brought back with them 8 Pieces of Cannon, about 30
Colours and Standards, with near 300 Priſoners, and, perhaps,
a more vigorous Action was never performed by Horſe alone,
with thoſe Diſadvantages of Ground and Number. Having
thus regained their firſt Poſt, and ſhortned their Purſuit of the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62930:113"/>
Enemy, for that they did not know but that the main Body
were engaged, the Hills ſeparating them from the Sight of
what paſſed on the Left. They found the Grand Viſier had
drawn up his whole Army in the Plain, to which the Duke of
<hi>Lorain</hi> oppoſed his, but that they both ſtood at a reſpectful
Diſtance from one another: However now, after this victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
little Body of Horſe had rejoined the Right Wing of the
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> began to make ſeveral Motions, which
ſhewed more their Uneaſineſs and Irreſolution, than any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
they had to attack the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and, having by degrees
withdrawn all their Infantry to the Foot of their own Hills,
the Right Wing of the Imperialiſts received Orders to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
towards ſome Bodies of Horſe that approached to them:
But proportionably, as the <hi>Germans</hi> advanced, the others
withdrew, till finding themſelves at the Foot of the Hill, and
ſeeing that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Right Wing had by much out-march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the reſt of the Army, they charged a ſmall Body of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi>
on the Left, who yielding before them, had like to
have laid open the <hi>German</hi> Flank, and wrought ſome Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
Yet by the Firmneſs of the <hi>German</hi> Troops, and Conduct
of their Officers, who immediately fronted ſome Squadrons
that way, and covered their Flank, the <hi>Turks</hi> retired; the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> at the ſame time, it being already late, having Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to withdraw, and return into their Lines, which they did
accordingly: The Grand Viſier alſo moved towards <hi>Alba Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galis;</hi>
and he ordered the Baſha, who brought him the News
of the ſaid Defeat, to be ſtrangled, for ſaying, <hi>That they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Chriſtians like Lions, but that they received them again like
Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return again to the Siege:<note place="margin">The Siege continued.</note> On the 16th it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with great Vigour; and at the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi>'s At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, the Palliſadoes with which the Enemy had ſecured the
Breach were burnt, but the Night following they ſet up new
ones again, and made other Works to defend the Breach;
while the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi> continued their Mines, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
and other Preparations, at their reſpective Attacks, for
a general Aſſault: So that on the 19th, all Things were again
ready for a Storm; but the 2 Mines which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſprang,
not throwing down the Enemies Palliſadoes, as was expected,
they did not then go on with it, but raiſed a Battery of 4 Pieces
of Cannon more, to play upon the Enemies Palliſadoes. Thus
Things continued to the 20th, when about 6 in the Morning
3000 choſen Janizaries and Spahi's, each of which received
30 Crowns from the Grand Viſier, to encourage them to that
Service, fell upon the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Out-guards, and forced them
and the <hi>Croats,</hi> who were poſted in the Plain, to retire into
the Camp; and, in the Confuſion occaſioned thereby, they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62930:114"/>
put about 150 Men into the Town, the reſt being beaten back
by the Troops which Count <hi>Caprara</hi> and General <hi>Heuſſer</hi>
brought to the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Croats.</hi> However, this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement
was not ſo conſiderable, as either to daunt the
<hi>Germans,</hi> or hearten the <hi>Turks</hi> much; tho' the latter perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtill as obſtinate in their Defence, as the other were reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
to carry the Place before they left it a ſecond time: To
which end they continued on the 21ſt, to play with their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
and Bombs from the 3 Attacks they had, and to fill the
Ditches, with that Succeſs, that on the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s ſide
all Things were ready for an Aſſault. But the Beſieged made
a Sally upon them next Day, and beat them from ſome of
their Works, which the <hi>Bavarians</hi> recovered ſoon after; and
not only ſo, but cut off the <hi>Turks</hi> they found there: Not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with that, on the 23d they made an Aſſault upon the
Caſtle, the Detachment which was appointed for that Service,
mounted the Breach, tho' defended by the <hi>Turks</hi> with great
Obſtinacy, whoſe Retrenchments they forced, and all their
other Poſts on that ſide, and remained abſolute Maſters of
the Caſtle, moſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> that were poſted there being
killed, and the reſt retired behind the Ruines of the Houſes,
from whence the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Cannon quickly chaſed them into
the Town, which was only ſeparated from the Caſtle by an
old Wall, of no great Defence. This being happily effected,
the Beſiegers beſtirred themſelves in all Quarters, to put the
finiſhing Stroke to the Work; and ſo much the more, becauſe
of the near Approach of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army again; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
amongſt other Things, on the 27th they laid a Boom
croſs the River, with Beams, to prevent any Body's ſwimming
into the Town, tho' none of the Enemy appeared, either that
or the next Day; But on the 29th, by Break of Day, a Party of
about 3000 Janizaries on Horſe-back advanced along the ſide
of the <hi>Danube,</hi> by the Hot Baths, with a Deſign to throw
themſelves into the Place, by the Way of the Lower Town;
to which Purpoſe, they brought along with them ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
like Ladders, made with Boards, which they applied to
the Wall, and about 6 <hi>Turks</hi> paſſed, who were cut off by thoſe
on the inſide. There were about 400 of them, who rid along
the Wall of the Lower Town, till they got to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
receiving the Fire of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Lines, which was there
doubled upon them; and a little further they met with a
Squadron of Horſe, who cut them all off, ſave 4 or 5 that
got into the Town: And, indeed, they were ſo confounded
with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Lines and Redoubts, that they knew not
which way to turn themſelves, ſo that they came off with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſiderable Loſs. Yet this Miſcarriage did not totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Grand Viſier, who on the 30th of <hi>Aug.</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62930:114"/>
by 3 ſeveral Ways, to put in Succours; but the Troops
appointed for that Service, were repulſed by thoſe which were
ſet for the Guard of the Imperial Lines, with the Loſs of 500
Men; Tho' to favour the Deſign, the Grand Viſier had at the
ſame time drawn up his Army in the Plain, making a Shew, as
if he would attack the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but went no farther: So that
the latter proceeded with all imaginable Application to fill up
the ſecond Ditch, and to put every Thing in a Readineſs for a
general Aſſault; to which they were the more encouraged,
by the Additional Re-inforcement they received on the 1ſt of
<hi>Sept.</hi> of near 10000 Men, under the Command of the Count
<hi>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Poſts at the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi>'s Attack the ſame Day. At
laſt the Second of <hi>Sept.</hi> came, when all Things being now
ready, it was unanimouſly reſolved in a Council of War
to ſtorm the Town; which was done in the following Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>They begun and continued from all their Batteries to play upon the Breaches,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Buda</hi> ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and the Flanks of the Enemies Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with Chain-ſhot, and at the ſame time, threw a great many
Bombs and Carcaſſes into the Town; and, to amuſe the <hi>Turks,</hi> the
Chriſtian Troops made ſeveral Movements, as if they deſigned
to fight the Grand Viſier; and part of thoſe that guarded the
Works towards the Town, were, in the Enemies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight, drawn
from thence towards the Lines, while double their Number
were detach'd, by cover'd Ways, to ſupply their Places. About
3 in the Afternoon the Palliſadoes that ſecured the Breaches
being beaten down, by the Beſiegers Cannon, 3000 Men, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into ſeveral Detachments, and ſupported by a like Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
made the Aſſault at the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi>'s Attack, being
commanded by the Duke of <hi>Newburg,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Croy,</hi>
Count <hi>Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hes,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Scherffenberg:</hi> At the <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Quarters 1500 Men were appointed in
each to begin the Aſſault, being alſo ſeconded with a Reſerve
of the like Number; and 2000 were appointed to make two
falſe Attacks. Things being thus ordered, the Detachments,
as ſoon as the Signal was given, advanced and mounted the
Breaches with as great Order as Courage; and the Beſieged
at the ſame time defended themſelves with a Reſolution equal
to what they had ſhewn upon other Occaſions; and with their
Fougades, Bombs, Stones, Bags filled with Powder, Pikes, and
other Arms, forced the <hi>Germans</hi> at the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi>'s At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
twice to retire: But theſe being ſupported by the Duke's
Preſence, who lead them on himſelf to the very Foot of the
Breach,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Buda</hi> taken.</note> going up the 3d time, entred the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the
Slaughter of 800 Janizaries, that defended the Breach on
that ſide, where the Viſier Baſha was himſelf, during the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62930:115"/>
whole Action, and gave incredible Proofs of his Bravery, and
would by no means quit his Poſt, though he was wounded
in the Right Arm, but taking his Sabre in his Left-Hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſtill to encourage his Men, till he fell among the ſlain;
which verified the Anſwer he firſt ſent the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi>
upon his Summons to him to ſurrender, by telling the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
<hi>Go, tell your General, I'll meet him upon the Breach.</hi>
The <hi>Brandenburghers</hi> entred the Town much the ſame time
as the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> did, and the <hi>Bavarians</hi> ſoon after; ſo that
forcing the Enemy from their ſeveral Poſts and Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Aſſailants advanced to the Market-place, and in
an Hour's time were abſolute Maſters of the Place. But the
<hi>Turks,</hi> after the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were entred the Town, ſprung a
Mine, and by the Means of a Train laid for that Purpoſe, ſet
ſeveral Houſes on fire, which continued burning till next
Morning, and conſumed abundance of rich Movables. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Soldiers found a great deal of Plate, Jewels, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſomuch, that many of them got 2 or 3000 <hi>l.</hi> a Man.
It was computed, there was 5000 fighting Men in the Town
at the time of the Aſſault, and that 3000 of them were ſlain
in the firſt Heat and Fury of the Soldiers; but about 1500 of
them retiring into a Redoubt on the ſide of the Caſtle, put
out a White Flag, and begged for Quarter; which, after hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Council of War, was, in Conſideration of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Night, and the Confuſion occaſioned in the Town by the
Fire, granted them: But the Vice-Baſha, and the Aga of the
Janizaries, with ſome others of Note, were taken Priſoners
before this. Of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there were about 500 ſlain, and
not quite ſo many wounded; but the Number of Cannon and
Mortars they found in the Town was very great, there being
no leſs than 400 Pieces of Cannon in all, and of them 170
were fit for Service, but moſt of them diſmounted; and there
was alſo conſiderable Ammunition left ſtill. But what made
the Conqueſt of this important Place ſo very glorious, was,
That it was obtained in the Sight of the whole <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army,
commanded by the Grand Viſier in Perſon, who lay encamped
within a Mile of <hi>Buda,</hi> and had poſſeſs'd himſelf of an Hill,
from whence he pretended to incommode the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with
his Cannon; yet, being obſerv'd narrowly by the brave Prince
<hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> who commanded upon this Occaſion, he ſet
fire to his Camp as ſoon as he heard the Town was taken, and
retired towards <hi>Alba Regalis.</hi> It was reported by a Deſerter,
That the Baſha of <hi>Buda</hi> had, 2 Days before the Place fell
into the Hands of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> written a very bold Letter
to the Grand Viſier, telling him, <hi>That for his own part, he
had performed his Duty by a long and vigorous Defence; but,
that the Grand Viſier could not excuſe himſelf, that he had ſo long
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62930:115"/>
been in ſight of the Place without Relieving it, which he could not
but have done, had his Men had but as much Courage as the Women
in the Town had, during the Siege.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things were no ſooner ſet in order at <hi>Buda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Five Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es <hi>beſieg'd.</hi>
               </note> but the Army moved to <hi>Paxi,</hi> the Duke having ſent Count <hi>Caraffa</hi> with a ſtrong Detachment, to lay Siege to <hi>Segedin,</hi> and the Prince
of <hi>Baden</hi> with another to take in <hi>Five Churches,</hi> of whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
we ſhall firſt give a ſhort Account, and then return
to the other: The Prince having joined ſome of the <hi>Croatian</hi>
Forces, did, on the 16th of <hi>Oct.</hi> after a very difficult March,
arrive before <hi>Five Churches,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> at the ſame time ſetting
fire to the Town, and retiring into the Caſtle; But the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Dragoons preſently ſcaling the Walls, threw themſelves
into the Place with their Sabres in their Hands, and opened
the Gates to the other Troops, who immediately quenched the
Fire, and intrenched themſelves in the principal Poſts, as far
as the great Moſque, and the Night following advanced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Musket-ſhot of the Caſtle, and began to raiſe Batteries.
However, the Caſtle being an irregular Square, fortified with
4 Roundels, and ſome other Works, according to the Modern
Fortification, and encompaſſed with Hills of very difficult Acceſs,
and having a Garriſon of 2500 Men in it, commanded by a
Baſha and 7 Beys, made the Siege go on but ſlowly at firſt,
and eſpecially in that the Imperial Troops ſtood in great need
of Forage. Yet, on the 18th and 19th the Beſiegers batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Place continually with their Cannon, and having made
a Breach next Day, began 3 Mines; the Prince in the mean
while ſending threatning Summons to the Beſieged to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,
who returned no Anſwer that Day; but next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by a Letter, deſired that ſome Perſon might be ſent to
them. Hereupon, Hoſtages were exchanged, and the
Treaty of Surrender was ſet on foot, which the Prince would
allow upon no other Terms than at Diſcretion; and the other,
wanting Ammunition,<note place="margin">Surrender'd.</note> were conſtrained to ſubmit to; ſo that
not only the Garriſon, but the Inhabitants, which were many
in Number, were made Priſoners of War.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ever the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> had put a good Garriſon into <hi>Five Churches,</hi> he divided his Forces into 2 Bodies; with one of them himſelf marched towards <hi>Dard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and the Count
<hi>de Sherffenberg</hi> advanced with the other to <hi>Syclos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos.</hi>
               </note> and on the
25th of <hi>Oct.</hi> arrived before it. After he had ſent his Summons
to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were retired into the Caſtle, and by their
Anſwer appeared reſolute to defend it, he began his Attack
the next Day, and continued it till the laſt Day of the Month,
with that Succeſs, that his Mines being ready to be ſprung,
the Beſieged ſurrender'd at Diſcretion, the Garriſon being
made Priſoners of War, and the Women and Children con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62930:116"/>
to other Places. After this the Count marched to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join

from the Seaſon, they began to render the Enterprize, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, very hazardous. But the Care the Grand Viſier took<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
occaſioned, if not the Loſs of the Place, yet, at leaſt, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening
of it; for having detached 2000 <hi>Turks</hi> and 4000 <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
to attempt the Relief of it, they advanced to a Place
called <hi>Scinta,</hi> within 4 <hi>Hungarians</hi> Miles of General <hi>Wallis</hi>'s
Camp, and there expected a further Reinforcement, in order
to proceed on their Deſign; which, together with the other
fore-mentioned Inconveniencies, proving very uneaſie to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Wallis,</hi> he called a Council of War; wherein it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
that General <hi>Veterani</hi> ſhould be ſent with a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to attack the <hi>Turks</hi> before their expected Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
came. In purſuance of this Reſolution, <hi>Veterani,</hi> on
the 19th at Night, marched with 10 Regiments, which made
not together above 5000 Men all Night long, though it was
very dark, and being got within a Mile and an half of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
by the Light of the Fire they made, drew up in Battalia
in 2 Lines; the firſt Commanded by Col. St. <hi>Croy,</hi> and the
other by the Baron <hi>de Ghotz,</hi> and in this Order advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Enemies Camp, hoping to ſurprize them at break
of Day: But it happened, that through the Darkneſs of the
Night, the Squadrons fell into ſome Diſorder, and by the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62930:116"/>
Noiſe they made, gave the Alarm to the <hi>Tartars</hi> out-guard.
However, the General continued his march with what Silence
and Conduct he could, and at break of Day fell into the <hi>Tartars</hi>
Quarters, while Col. <hi>Ghotz</hi> with 3 Regiments forced that of
the <hi>Turks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Scinta.</hi>
               </note> of both which they made a great Slaughter, and
took divers Priſoners, by whom they underſtood the <hi>Tartars</hi>
were about 7000 ſtrong: But the Enemy had no ſooner aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
their Camp, than that the <hi>German</hi> Soldiers fell to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, notwithſtanding the ſtrict Orders given by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
to the Contrary, which the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> obſerving,
they Rallied, and returning with great Fury, fell upon Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Veterani,</hi> who was for the preſent forced to retreat, having
with him but 3 Squadrons; and would have been in great
Danger, had not Col. St. <hi>Croix</hi> haſted with his Regiment to
his Aſſiſtance, being followed by Col. <hi>Caſtelli</hi> with 3 Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
more, that he had got together in great haſte, which
renewed the Fight with great ſharpneſs. But at laſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was routed and fled, yet were not much purſued, <hi>Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rani</hi>
thinking it enough to pillage their Camp now, and then
to return to <hi>Segedin,</hi> which he was upon doing accordingly.
However, in his march, perceiving a great Body of Horſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Left, he was much ſurprized at it, and thinking no other
way of eſcape was left him, but to be Reſolute, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
drew up his Troops in Battalia, and advanced towards
the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were little leſs than 12000 ſtrong, and all
Horſe, ſave 500 Janizaries, who guarded the Cannon, and
who charged the Imperialiſts 5 ſeveral times, being incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Preſence of the Grand Viſier, who was ſaid to be
amongſt them, and which ſeemed afterward to be confirmed
by the Baggage that was taken. But after an obſtinate Fight
of 2 Hours, the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> were entirely defeated, with
the Slaughter of above 2000, and the Loſs of all their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
and Cannon, a great many fine Horſes, 400 Mules, and

of ſhewing no Mercy to the Garriſon, if they reſiſted,
they gave up the Place the very next Day, leaving 20 Pieces

General <hi>Coninſmark, June</hi> 14, after leaving a ſufficient

Count <hi>Coninſmark</hi> had with him, being reinforced with 14000

Men from on Board the Fleet, he reſolved to paſs the River

Battery of 7 Mortars was finiſhed, and a Summons ſent from
the Captain-General to the commanding Baſha to ſurrender, to
which he appeared, yet ſtiff enough: So that the Siege went
on, and by the 28th the Trenches were carried within 50
Paces of the Ditch, notwithſtanding the continual Oppoſition
made by the Enemy with their great and ſmall Shot, who alſo
on <hi>July</hi> the 1ſt, made a Sally, but were ſoon repulled; and

Inhabitants, who being terrified by the Execution of the
Bombs,<note place="margin">Surrendred.</note> that had by this time laid a great part of the Town in

               </note> as to purſue them ſtill, and

upon the Eaſtern Shoar of the <hi>Morea,</hi> and having got all

prevent the <hi>Seraſquier,</hi> who lay with a Body of about 9000
Men not far off, to reinforce 2 Days after the Garriſon with
300 Men, which conſiſted before of no leſs than 2000, under

on the 6th, and General <hi>Coninſmark</hi> was ſo far from declining
a Battel, that after having left Force ſufficient to guard the
Works about the Town, he marched about 2 Miles out of his
Camp to meet him, and after ſome light Skirmiſhes, the 2 Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
engaged, but the <hi>Turks</hi> did not hold it long: For, having
loſt about 400 Men, they retired, and the General ſoon after
went back to his Camp, and quickly poſſeſt himſelf of the

not only drove them furiouſly back into the Town, but they
gave ſo warm an Entertainment to the <hi>Seraſquier</hi> from the
Cannon they had planted upon the Hill <hi>Palameda,</hi> that he was
obliged to go off without making any Attempt upon their
Lines. This gave the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> an Opportunity to purſue
the Siege, and on the 23d to lodge themſelves in the Ditch of
the Town and maintain their Poſt there; but they received
Information the ſame Day, that the <hi>Seraſquier</hi> having reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

again to attack their Lines; the Beſieged at the ſame time

March, they arrived <hi>Sept.</hi> 23, and found it not only ſituate on
a Rock, but fortified with a good Wall, and a ſtrong Caſtle.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62930:119"/>
However, they broke Ground before it the ſame Day, and
raiſed 2 Batteries of 2 Pieces of Cannon, and one Mortar each,
with which, by the 25th, they began to batter both Town
and Caſtle, and in a few Hours diſmounted the Enemies Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
that were planted on the great Roundel. The Provedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-General
in the mean time ſent the Governour a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
offering the ſame Conditions as had been granted
to <hi>Navarino</hi> and <hi>Modon:</hi> But the Commandant, who was a
<hi>Dalmatian</hi> Runagado, anſwered, He would defend the Place
to the laſt, and would loſe his Life with what the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
had intruſted in his Hands; adding, That he expected
ſpeedy Relief from the Baſha of <hi>Arcegovina,</hi> who was within
12 Hours march of the Place. Upon this, the Beſiegers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fire again from their Cannon and Mortars, which they
continued till the 26th; when finding the Breaches were large
enough, and that the Palliſadoes, and other Defences the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
had made behind them were beaten down, the Prince
of <hi>Parma</hi> appointed 500 Foot, under the Command of the
Marqueſs <hi>de Borri,</hi> accompanied by divers Voluntiers, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by a Reſerve of 400 Men, to make an Aſſault; upon
whoſe approach, the <hi>Turks</hi> put themſelves into a Poſture of
Defence, and with Granadoes and Stones withſtood the Efforts
of the Aſſailants for 3 Hours and upwards: But theſe at laſt
prevailed, and gained the Breach; which made the Enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into their ſecond Entrenchment and the Caſtle, where
they put up a White Flag, which the Commandant pulled down
with his own Hand.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sign</hi> taken.</note> yet, this did not at all daunt the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
who puſhing on to the ſecond Retrenchment, took both
it and the Caſtle, and cut in pieces all the Garriſon, ſparing
only ſome few Women and Children; which Slaughter, all the
Endeavours of the Marqueſs <hi>de Borri</hi> could not prevent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Chevalier <hi>Janco,</hi> to revenge the Death of ſome of
his Relations, killed in the Aſſault, would give no Quarter.
The <hi>Venetians</hi> found 8 Pieces of Cannon, and a conſiderable
Number of other Arms, as alſo great many Mules in the
Place; together with a very good Magazine of Powder. But,
tho' the Plunder was inconſiderable to the Soldiery, the <hi>Turks</hi>
having before the Siege removed their beſt Effects to other
Places, yet the Town was of very great Conſequence to the

him as his declared Enemy.</q> But this would not do, with the

But the Court-Marſhal, who commanded the Van-guard of the
Army, was engaged the Day before with 8000 <hi>Tartars</hi> for
near 2 Hours together, the latter having at firſt the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
who preſſed very hard upon the <hi>Poles;</hi> Yet theſe being
ſeconded by ſome freſh Troops, repulſed the others, and put
them to flight, with the Loſs of 800 of their Men ſlain, many
Priſoners, and one of the Cham's own Standards. They had
divers other ſmall Rencounters from time to time, which yet
did not hinder the King's advancing to <hi>Falxin,</hi> with an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to continue his March to <hi>Budziack;</hi> but being informed
he muſt paſs over ſeveral great Mountains, and that the Towns
and Villages were burnt, and the Forage deſtroyed by the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
he held a Council of War, where it was reſolved, that
for the better Subſiſtance of the Troops, the Army ſhould paſs
the River <hi>Pruth,</hi> the Country not being yet ruined on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide; which was done accordingly: But upon Advice,
that the <hi>Tartars</hi> had likewiſe paſſed that River, and burnt and
ruined all the Country, and deſtroyed all the Springs of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it was reſolved to march towards <hi>Jaſſi;</hi> which they did
in 6 Days time, having the Enemy continually in ſight of them
on the other ſide of the River, commanded by the Seraſquier
and Sultan <hi>Nuradin,</hi> and Cannonaded one another ſeveral times:
However, the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army got ſafe to their Camp, near <hi>Jaſſi,</hi>
but the <hi>Turks, Tartars,</hi> and Hoſpodar's Men had no Deſign
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62930:120"/>
they ſhould continue long ſo, for they kept the Troops in a
perpetual Alarm, and frequently cut off the King's Foragers,
which greatly perplexed him. So that underſtanding at laſt,
that the main Body of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> commanded by Sultan <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin,</hi>
was come near his Camp, yet without being able pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
to learn the Place where they were, he cauſed it to be
publiſhed among the <hi>Moldavians, That whoever brought him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Intelligence of them, ſhould have the Reward of</hi> 200 <hi>Crowns.</hi>
Whereupon, one that was well acquainted with the Country,
went into the Enemies Camp, and having obſerved it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and gave the King an Account, that they lay within
a Mile of his Army, and that a Party of 4000 <hi>Tartars</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
at ſome diſtance from the reſt. The King being thus
informed of the Poſture the Enemy were in, detached the
Court-Marſhal and the Court-Treaſurer about Midnight, to
attack thoſe advanced Troops, and followed himſelf with the
whole Army. This Detachment, with the Help of the <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davian,</hi>
who was their Guide, came upon the Enemy before
they had time to retire to their main Body, and, after a ſharp
Diſpute, entirely routed them, taking about 300 Priſoners,
among whom were ſeveral <hi>Murza</hi>'s, and other Perſons of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

who not knowing of the Defeat of their advanced Troops,
expected they would have fallen upon the <hi>Poles</hi> in their Rear
and Flank; and with this Encouragement, they put themſelves

after a ſhort fight, were routed, and forced to flee, leaving a

were doing by the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army abroad, the Country nearer
Home was cruelly ravaged by the Garriſon of <hi>Caminiec,</hi> who
made frequent Incurſions into the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Territories: Which,
together with the King's marching homeward after this laſt
Action, and demoliſhing the fore-mentioned Forts in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
which he had raiſed as he went onwards, made this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
to be little thought of; and as little Advantage to

                        <p>IT having pleaſed Almighty God not only to bring Us to the Imperial Crown of theſe Kingdoms, through the greateſt Difficulties, but to preſerve Us by a more than ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
upon the Throne of Our Royal Anceſtors; there is
nothing now that We ſo earneſtly deſire, as to Eſtabliſh our
Government on ſuch a Foundation, as may make Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
happy, and unite them to Us by Inclination as well as
Duty; which We think can be done by no Means ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
as by granting to them the free Exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
for the Time to come, and add that to the perfect En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of their Property, which has never been in any Caſe
invaded by Us ſince Our coming to the Crown: Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Two Things Men value moſt, ſhall ever be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in theſe Kingdoms, during our Reign over them, as the
trueſt Methods of their Peace and Our Glory. We cannot
but heartily wiſh, as it will eaſily be believed, that all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Our Dominions were Members of the Catholick
Church, yet We humbly thank Almighty God, it is, and
hath of long time been Our conſtant Senſe and Opinion
(which upon divers Occaſions We have declared) that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ought not to be conſtrained, nor People forced in
Matters of meer Religion: It has ever been directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Our Inclination, as We think it is to the Intereſt of
Government, which it deſtroys by ſpoiling Trade, depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Countries, and diſcouraging Strangers; and finally,
that it never obtained the End for which it was employed:
And in this We are the more Confirmed by the Reflections
We have made upon the Conduct of the Four laſt Reigns.
For, after all the frequent and preſſing Endeavours that were
uſed in each of them, to reduce this Kingdom to an exact
Conformity in Religion, it is viſible the Succeſs has not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Deſign, and that the Difficulty is invincible; We
therefore out of Our Princely Care and Affection unto all
Our Loving Subjects, that they may live at Eaſe and Quiet,
and for the Increaſe of Trade, and Incouragement of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
have thought fit, by Virtue of Our Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
to iſſue forth this Our Declaration of Indulgence;
making no doubt of the Concurrence of Our Two Houſes of

                        <p>We do likewiſe declare, That it is Our Royal Will and Pleaſure, That from henceforth the Execution of all, and all manner of Penal Laws in Matters Eccleſiaſtical, for not coming

Non-conformity to the Religion Eſtabliſhed, or for, or by

Houſes, or Places purpoſely Hired or Built for that Uſe; ſo
that they take eſpecial Care, that nothing be Preached or
Taught amongſt them, which may any ways tend to Alienate
the Hearts of Our People from Us, or Our Government;
And that their Meetings and Aſſemblies be peaceably, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and publickly held, and all Perſons freely admitted to
them; And that they do ſignifie and make known to ſome one
or more of the next Juſtices of the Peace, what Place or
Places they ſet apart for thoſe Uſes.</p>
                        <p>And that all Our Subjects may enjoy ſuch their Religious Aſſemblies with greater Aſſurance and Protection, We have thought it requiſite, and do hereby Command, That no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance

from all Pains, Penalties, Forfeitures, and Diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by them or any of them incurred or forfeited, or which
they ſhall or may at any time hereafter be liable to, for, or
by reaſon of their Non-conformity, or the Exerciſe of their

The Generality of Proteſtant Diſſenters having for near
7 Years together, been ſo ſeverely treated by the Tory Party,
were as forward to congratulate the King for his Indulgence
in ſeveral Addreſſes, as the Tories were in King <hi>Charles</hi> his
Time, in their Addreſſes of Abhorrence, to Petition the King
to call a Parliament to ſettle the Grievances of the Nation.
However, this Declaration was drawn up ſo in ſight of every
Bird, that moſt part of the Thinking ſort of Diſſenters did
dread and deteſt it: But yet, to make it more paſſable, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Judges were made in <hi>Weſtminiſter-Hall,</hi> and Popiſh Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of the Peace, and Deputy-Lieutenants all <hi>England</hi> over,
while the Privy-Council was filled up with Popiſh Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors;
nay, the <hi>Savoy</hi> was laid open to inſtruct Youth in the
Popiſh Religion, and Popiſh Principles; which gave Occaſion
to that good Man, Dr. <hi>Teniſon,</hi> now Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
and it ought to be remembred always to his Honour, to erect
his Free School at St. <hi>Martins</hi> in oppoſition to it. But this
would not ſtop the Popiſh Zeal; for, other Schools to the ſame
End were encouraged in <hi>London,</hi> and all other Places in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and 4 Foreign Popiſh Biſhops, as Vicars Apoſtolical,
were allowed in Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi>
over. And becauſe his Majeſty would not be wanting to pay
his Duty as well as other Catholick Princes, to the common
Father of them all, the Pope; the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> was ſent
Embaſſador to <hi>Rome,</hi> to tender the King's Obedience to the
Holy and Apoſtolical See, with great Hopes of extirpating the
Northern peſtilent Hereſie: In return whereof the Pope ſent
his Nuncio to give the King his Holy Benediction, and that
without ſending before-hand, as his Predeceſſors were wont to
do, for leave to enter the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>To all this we may add, that the Judges in their Circuits had their private Inſtructions, to know how Men ſtood affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the King's Diſpenſing Power; and thoſe who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the leaſt Diſlike of it, were turned out of their Offices
and Employments without any more ado: And that theſe
Things might be acted with Security, <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> qualified by the Teſts to
ſerve, ſent over an Army of <hi>Iriſh</hi> that were not qualified, to
encreaſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, who by this time were grown into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably
inſolent; though the King, by ſeveral Orders, would
have had their Quarters reſtrained to Victualling Houſes,
Houſes of Publick Entertainment, and ſuch as had Licenſes to
ſell Wine and other Liquors. The Officers too, when they
pleaſed, would be exempt from the Civil Power: And tho'
the King had no other War upon his Hands, but againſt the
Laws and Conſtitutions of the Government, yet he would
make an obſolete Act of Parliament, that made it Felony
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62930:123"/>
without Benefit of Clergy, for any Soldier's taking Pay in the
King's Service, in his Wars beyond Sea, or upon the Sea, or
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to deſert from his Officer, to extend to this new-raiſed
Army. And becauſe the worthy Recorder of <hi>London,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Holt,</hi> would not expound that Law according to the
King's Deſign, he was put out of his Place; and ſo was Sir
<hi>Edward Herbert</hi> from being Chief Juſtice of the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi>
to make way for Sir <hi>Robert Wright,</hi> to hang a poor Soldier up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>It would be an endleſs Thing to enumerate the diſorderly Proceedings of this Year; yet, I doubt, you will hear of no leſs in the next; but you muſt ſtay a little, and take a View

<hi>Feutar,</hi> broke up <hi>June</hi> 17, from thence, and continued his
March towards <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> and becauſe the Army left <hi>Alba Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
behind it, a Body of Light-Horſe were left behind to cover
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62930:123"/>
the Baggage; and on the 18th a Bridge of Boats was laid near
<hi>Tolna,</hi> over which the whole Army paſſed by the 20th, and
encamped a Mile from thence, and removed afterwards to
<hi>Mohatz,</hi> as they did their Bridge likewiſe, that ſo the 2 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
might ſuccour each other. The Duke at the ſame time
ſent an Expreſs to the <hi>Croatian</hi> Troops, to ſecure the Bridge
that was laid over the <hi>Drave,</hi> near <hi>Syclos,</hi> and there erect like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that of Boats that they carried along with them, which
was punctually performed. From <hi>Mohatz</hi> the Duke marched
on the 24th to <hi>Darda,</hi> aſide of the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck;</hi> which, as
ſoon as the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were hard at work in repairing the
Bridges over the Moraſs, had Notice of, they abandoned their
Works, and retreated towards the Bridge of Boats they had
over the <hi>Drave,</hi> and which they had ſecured with a good Fort
of Earth and Wood, having left ſome Bodies of Horſe and
Foot among the Moraffes, to diſpute the Approach of it with
the Imperialiſts. The Duke, the Night following, cauſed the
Bridge, and Diſpoſition of the Enemy to be view'd, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the neceſſary Detachments to attack them by Break of Day,
when Word was brought him, that the Enemy had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
2 Boats of their Bridges, and that there was no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of them. However, a Detachment from the Army
croſſed the Moraſſes on the 25th, and advanced towards the
Enemies Bridge of Boats in good Order, who, when the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
were come within an 150 Paces of them, fired very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
upon them, ſo as that they were forced a little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat;
but being ſuſtained with freſh Troops, they charged
the <hi>Turks</hi> with ſo much Reſolution, that they quitted their
Poſt, and retreated into their Fort, from whence the <hi>Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi>
alſo drove them, whom they purſued as far as the Gare
of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> where they had like to have entred the Town <hi>Pell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell</hi>
with them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> endeavoured to preſerve the Bridge, but ſeveral Mills and Boats being ſet on float, were by the Rapidity of the Stream thrown ſo impetuouſly upon it, that they broke
one part of it, and hindred the reſt from being ſeized on, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that it was now thought moſt adviſable to ſet it on fire.
Next Day, after having viewed the Ground, and a Draught
taken for the Building of a new Fort, they began to break
Ground, which yet was not done without Diſturbance from
the Enemy; but the very ſame Day, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> entirely
ruined the Dykes which the <hi>Turks</hi> had made upon the Moraſſes,
in the room of the Bridges that had been burnt towards the
End of the laſt Campaign, which was difficult Work; And
then it was reſolved, that a Line of Communication ſhould
be drawn from the Entrance of the Moraſſes, as far as the
Fort, that ſo under its cover the Troops might paſs, that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62930:124"/>
ſhould be needful for its Defence, in caſe the <hi>Turks</hi> were mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to attack it. Things thus paſſed on till the 28th, when
the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> having choſe out from among the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
ſuch as could Swim beſt, he ordered them to go and
fire the Boats, Mills, and Barges which the <hi>Turks</hi> had poſted
within Musket-ſhot of <hi>Eſſeck.</hi> They punctually executed their
Orders, but the Enemy put out the Fire before it produced
any Effect; which, with many other Conſiderations, made
the Duke call a Council of War next Day, where having
judged it impoſſible to paſs the <hi>Drave</hi> at the Place where they
were encamped, it was reſolved to break up from thence;
And accordingly on the 30th, the Duke having left the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
to guard the Paſs, and to ruine the Bridges of the
Moraſs, departed with the Infantry, a Regiment of <hi>Curaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers,</hi>
and one of Dragoons, and moved up the <hi>Drave,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Fort, which the Imperialiſts had over that River
near <hi>Siclos,</hi> near unto which he arrived <hi>July</hi> 1, ſending at
the ſame time ſome Detachments out to ſcowr the Fields,
and diſcover the Poſture of the Enemy, of whom they could
get no certain Intelligence. Yet the Duke failed in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of paſſing the River there alſo, which was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown,
that there was no Poſſibility of it; So that he ſent
Troops up along the ſame, to try if there was no other place
where he might do it, and reſolved, that in caſe it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
to imploy his Army in the Siege of <hi>Sigeth.</hi> But the
Time ſpun out to the 5th of the Month, when General <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald,</hi>

Duke to poſt the <hi>Heydukes</hi> upon the Hills, in order to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Paſſage of the Troops, while in the mean time, 9
Bridges were finiſhed that had been ordered to be laid over
Moraſſes: So that on the 6th, ſome Companies of Foot and
Dragoons were waſted over in Boats, with Orders to incamp
on the other ſide of the <hi>Drave,</hi> and there to intrench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which they did with great Diligence, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſſiſted
therein mightily with 1200 Peaſants, brought thither for that
Purpoſe: And notwithſtanding the variety of different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
that were ſpread concerning the Enemies Army, the
whole Army, Horſe and Foot, together with their Artillery
and Baggage, paſſed the <hi>Drave</hi> by the 13th, when the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
of <hi>Bavaria</hi> came into the Camp, having left his Troops
ſome Leagues of, which got up towards the Evening, and then
a Review was taken of the Army, which was found to be
55000 Men. From the foreſaid Place the Army marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Enemy, and on their Way heard divers uncertain
Reports concerning their Number, Strength and Deſign, but
they moved on, and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who Commanded
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62930:124"/>
the Van guard, did on the 17th place himſelf at the Head of
ſome Squadrons and 2 Battallions, with ſome Dragoons, and
2 Field-Pieces, in Battel Array, as well as the Ground would
admit in a Plain interlain with Wood, and faced on the other
ſide with a Moraſs; and in this Poſture found 3000 of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Horſe, advantageouſly poſted at the Entrance of the
Defiles, whom he charged with that Bravery, that they quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Poſt, which 2 of his Battallions took poſſeſſion of.
The Army at the ſame time moving forwards through the
Defiles, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> lead the Van on the 18th, and
after very great Difficulty from the Badneſs of the Ways, and
Firings of the Enemies Detachments, who killed a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they were by the 20th draws up in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
Array, in the Form of an Half-Moon, about half a League
from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> did all that was poſſible to draw the <hi>Turks</hi> to a Battel, and ſent ſeveral Detachments to skirmiſh to the very Head of their Retrenchments, but all to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
So that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> perceived by the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
they were not diſpoſed to fight, tho' they made
great uſe of their Ordinance all the while. But it was not
thought at all expedient to attack them there, ſeeing they
were ſo ſtrongly intrenched, and that ſince the coming up of
the Grand Viſier, their Number was computed to be near
80000 Men. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſides all which, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> beginning to
want Forage, Proviſions and Ammunition, it was reſolved, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
24 Hours ſtay, in a Council of War, to decamp from thence,
which was done on the 21ſt, and the Retreat made in very
good Order, the <hi>Turks</hi> not concerning themſelves much to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, only they contented themſelves vigorouſly to change
a Guard, that had been out off if the Elector of <hi>Bavania,</hi> at
the Head of a <hi>Neuburg</hi> Squadron, had not ſuccoured them;
ſo that the Army on the 23d repaſſed the <hi>Drave,</hi> but had like
to have periſhed firſt: For ſome Traytors holding Intelligence
with the Grand Viſier, had undertaken to cut the Cables that
held the Bridges, but the Deſign was happily diſcovered, and
one of the Officers ſeiz'd, and immediately Empaled, his wicked
Accompliſhes having by their Flight eſcaped the Puniſhment:
So that, in ſhort, the Army by the 29th was got near to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatz,</hi>
where they were reinforced with the <hi>Swabian</hi> Troops,
amounting to 8000 Men, which enabled the Duke, beſides a
Detachment ſent under <hi>Veterani</hi> to reinforce the Blockade of
<hi>Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ia,</hi> and another towards <hi>Croatia,</hi> to ſend a ſtrong Body of
8000 Men under General <hi>Dunwald,</hi> to cover <hi>Syclos</hi> and <hi>Five
Churches,</hi> while himſelf with the main Army deſigned to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his March towards <hi>Felixmarton,</hi> But that Reſolution
was quickly changed upon his receiving Information on the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62930:125"/>
31ſt, That the Grand Viſier had the Night before paſſed the
Bridges near <hi>Eſſeck</hi> with his whole Army, who ſpent <hi>Aug.</hi> 1,
in intrenching themſelves, which yet did not hinder the Duke
to advance towards them, to engage them, if poſſible, to
a Battel; and to give that gallant Man his due, he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
nothing on his part that might induce them to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though with little appearance of Succeſs: Till at laſt being
vex'd with the Loſs of Time, he reſolved to make the Army
fall back, as well to get at ſome diſtance from a Wood, whence
the <hi>Tartars</hi> diſturbed his Foragers, as to induce once more the
Grand Viſier to quit his Camp and to follow him. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
was done on the 8th, but without Succeſs neither; which
put the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> upon making a ſhew, as if they would take
away the Garriſons of <hi>Syclos</hi> and <hi>Five Churches,</hi> and abandon
thoſe Places, and accordingly they continued a ſlow March
that way.</p>
            <p>And thus Things continued to the 12th, when the Grand Viſier, poſſibly at laſt, preſuming that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> declined Fighting,<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Mohatz.</hi>
               </note> cauſed the greateſt part of his Troops to advance,
and about 2 in the Afternoon 10000 Spahi's, and 5000 Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries
were ſeen directly to march upon the Left Wing of the
<hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of
<hi>Baden,</hi> Commanded. They were led on by ſome Bodies of
Horſe, whoſe Charge General <hi>Dunwald</hi> vigorouſly ſtood the
Brunt of, after which he retreated upon the firſt Line; when
in a Moment after, a Body of Janizaries poſted themſelves
upon a riſing Ground with ſome Pieces of Cannon, laden with
Chain-ſhot, which fired upon the Left of the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> to
endeavour to put them into Diſorder. This, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the 10000 Spahi's, made the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to order
the Front of the Left Wing to be enlarged, according as he
perceived that of the Enemy to do, which yet could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Time enough, the Regiments of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Commercy</hi> to
be attacked both in Front and Flank, with extraordinary Fury,
who ſtood as firmly to it, till the Elector haſted thither to
aſſiſt them, where he received a ſlight Wound by a Bullet in
his Hand. But while Things paſſed thus on the Left, the Duke
of <hi>Lorain</hi> had formed a Creſcent on the Right Wing, whoſe
Right extended towards the Flank of the Enemy, who attackt
the Left, and the Left ſide went to encounter another Body of
Spahi's, and Janizaries that came up to charge them; And
now the Battel grew very hot, and they fought a long time
on both ſides with extraordinary Courage, the <hi>Turks</hi> being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to do it more orderly than in former Battels. But at
length the Day inclined in favour of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, the
Infidels beginning by little and little to loſe Ground; and very
quickly after betook themſelves to an open Fight, the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:62930:125"/>
purſuing them to their very Camp, which they entred
<hi>Pell-mell</hi> with the Conquered, made an horrible Slaughter of
all that came before them, and maſtered all the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
without halting, and all with the Loſs of not above 700
Men. But it coſt the <hi>Turks</hi> much dearer, for beſides 2000
ſlain upon the Spot, there was a vaſt Number of them drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Moraſſes, and the River into which they fell by the
breaking of the Bridge, which being put together, made it
amount by the Eſtimate of ſome to about 16000 Men. But
how uncertain ſoever the Number of Men loſt might be, the
Booty was very great and beneficials; for, beſides an 116 Pieces
of Cannon and Mortars, a vaſt Quantity of Ammunition, with
divers Standards and Colours, there was a World of Silver
and precious Moveables found in the Camp; and particularly
the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had a very rich Booty of the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier's
Tent for his Share, which was ſo vaſt, that it rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
a Caſtle than what it was really made for, and was
enriched with Gold, Pearls and precious Stones, all that Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer's
Plate, his Jewels, Moveables, Chancery, and 40000 Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kats
that were found in his Treaſury.</p>
            <p>But though this Blow might have been thought to be a fatal one to the <hi>Turks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tranſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> revolts.</note> yet there was one Accident hapned in the Nick of it, that gave them an Opportunity to breath and
re-aſſume ſome freſh Strength, and diverted the main Army of
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Deſigns they had to proſecute their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
upon the <hi>Drave;</hi> And that was the Prince of <hi>Tranſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
(notwithſtanding the Treaty he had made with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror)
his ſuddain declaring himſelf in favour of the Port. But
this we ſhall come to by and by, and obſerve at preſent, that
though the moſt important Work of the remaining Campaign
was to endeavour to reduce the ſaid Prince to the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
yet there was a Neceſſity of covering <hi>Syclos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Five
Churches,</hi> and therefore this Work was conſigned into the
Hands of General <hi>Dunwald,</hi> who had further Orders to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to paſs the <hi>Drave,</hi> and attempt as he ſaw Opportunity
the Fortreſs of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> and other Places poſſeſt by the <hi>Turks</hi> in
<hi>Sclavonia.</hi> It was on the 30th of <hi>Aug.</hi> before the ſaid Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
could paſs the <hi>Drave,</hi> and what with croſs Intelligence and
had Weather, he made it the 11th of <hi>Sept.</hi> before he began the
Siege of the Caſtle of <hi>Butſchin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Butſchin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts.</hi>
               </note> ſituated between the <hi>Drave</hi> and
the <hi>Save,</hi> the taking of which would be a means for the Troops
of <hi>Croatia</hi> to extend their Winter-Quarters as far as the laſt of
the ſaid Rivers. The Works were carried on with much Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
and the Commanding <hi>Aga</hi> ſummoned to ſurrender,
whoſe Anſwer was. To defend the Place to the laſt Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which he had ſo much the more Reaſon for, in that the Bey
of <hi>Poſſega</hi> had ſent him Word, he would ſpeedily relieve him,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62930:126"/>
and threatning withal, to empale him if he performed not his
Duty. However, the Battery that was directed againſt the
Caſtle having, by the 14th, made a conſiderable Breach, it
made the Aga, ſeeing now the Place was in great Danger of
being taken by Storm, think better of the Matter and beat a
Parley: But no other Terms would be allowed him, than a
Surrender at Diſcretion; which he was forced to ſubmit to,
and conſign into the Hands of the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> that important
Fortreſs, which laid about 100 Villages under Contribution,
and covered <hi>Virovitza</hi> and St. <hi>George</hi> from the Enterprizes of
the <hi>Turks;</hi> and was a Means to hinder them from paſſing the
<hi>Drave,</hi> to put Succours into <hi>Sigeth</hi> and <hi>Caniſia.</hi> But though
this ſucceſsful Enterprize ſeemed to promiſe ſo much, yet what
followed, in relation to <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> was of much greater Importance:
For, tho' the General, according to the firſt Intelligence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in relation to the Garriſon, thought he ſhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to force it by a formal Siege; yet being ſoon after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by a Deſerter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſſeck</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </note> that the Garriſon of the ſaid Place ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Notice of his March, had abandoned it on the 29th of
<hi>Sept.</hi> and that ſo haſtily, that they forgot to fire 7 Mines for
the blowing up the Fortifications at their Retreat; He was as
much ſurprized at the Relation at firſt, as he was over-joyed
afterwards, when, upon the Information of the Count <hi>de Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi>
whom, upon the News, he had detached thither, he was
confirmed of the Truth of the Deſerter's Account: With this
further Addition, That he found 52 Pieces of Cannon, 4 Mortars
and a vaſt Quantity of Ammunition and Proviſions therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Conſequence of this Deſertion of <hi>Eſſeck</hi> was, the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Walpo</hi> at Diſcretion, and the Abandouing of <hi>Poſſega,</hi>
the Capital City of <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> with ſome other Places on that
ſide.</p>
            <p>But as for the principal Army, under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> they paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> on the 19th of <hi>Aug.</hi>
near <hi>Mohatz,</hi> directing their March towards <hi>Peter-Waradin,</hi>
which the Duke had an Eye upon before he went any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but finding the Grand Viſier advantageouſly poſted with
his whole Army not far from it, and that his Deſign was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable,
he moved towards <hi>Segedin,</hi> where the Duke ſtaid
till the 15th of <hi>Sept.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> reduced by the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts.</hi>

which all the Submiſſion, and Offers of Money, and other
Refreſhments, by Prince <hi>Abafti,</hi> who was now ſenſible of his
Error, would not exempt him from: For the Duke wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
that Country under the Emperor's Obedience, cauſing
all the Prince's Troops to evacuate the Fortreſſes, into which
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62930:126"/>
he put Imperial Forces; and withal, concluded a very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
Treaty with Prince <hi>Abafti,</hi> and the States of <hi>Tranſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania.</hi>
This ſo much more heightned the Joy of the Imperial

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpire it ſelf: For, though the
Grand Viſier, by his great Authority, obtained private Orders
from the Port to ſecure <hi>Oſman</hi> and his Adherenfs, yet <hi>Oſman</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:62930:127"/>
found the Means to penetrate into the Deſign very early; And
therefore, he being a Perſon that knew how to captivate the
Affections of the Soldiery by the Means of Booty, as having
been once the Head of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Highway men, he ſped ſo
far as to make them Mutiny againſt <hi>Solyman;</hi> who finding he
had no Forces to ſtand by him, and no Means to pacifie the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers,
he thought fit, together with the <hi>Tefterdan,</hi> or Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Treaſurer,
and <hi>Rais Effendt</hi> the Grand-Chancellor, to flee by
Water to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> there to expect the Grand Signior's fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Orders; and employed <hi>Rogeb</hi> the Caimacan of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
who had been advanced by him to that Office, to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Grand Signior's Diſpleaſure upon the Overthrow of the
Army. Herein he ſucceeded for the Viſier ſo far; but withal,
had a Promiſe to have himſelf advanced into the other's Place.
In the mean time, the mutinous Troops, and <hi>Oſman</hi> Baſha,
fearing the Repreſentations of the Grand Viſier, choſe 4 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
to attend the Grand Signior, to repreſent their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
to him; while he, in the mean time, had ordered,
that a Veſt and Sword ſhould be diſpatched to <hi>Oſman,</hi> declaring
him Seraſquier, and permitting <hi>Solyman</hi> to go to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi>
who, on his Way, underſtanding the Deſigns of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to have him depoſed, he conſigned the Seal and Standard
of <hi>Mahomet</hi> into the Hands of the Treaſurer and Chancellor,
and went privately into the City, hoping, by the Means of the
Caimacan, his ſuppoſed Creature, to facilitate his Ingreſs to
the Grand Signior; while the fore-mentioned Deputies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in the mean time to get <hi>Oſman</hi> declared Grand Viſier.
But how ſpeedy ſoever theſe Remedies againſt the impending
Evils were thought to be, the Soldiers Diſorders were more
forward; who were not only now intent upon their own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
but proceeded from Military, to Political Matters,
and to lay hand even to the Helm it ſelf; to which End they
marched away for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with a firm Reſolution, and
ſolemn Vow, to reform the preſent Government; and cauſe
to fall, as Victims to their own Eſtabliſhment, the Head of
the <hi>Kiſtar</hi> Aga, and Chief of the Black Eunuchs, who
was the Grand Signior's chiefeſt Favourite, and divers O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Grand Signior was mightily ſurprized with this Advice; and, notwithſtanding the good Counſel given him by the Caimacan, of retiring to the great <hi>Seraglio,</hi> with ſome
choice Troops, and there make a bold Stand againſt the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers,
and of procuring a Sentence from the Mufti to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
them Guilty of High-Treaſon; he could gain little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them in the firſt Point, or upon the Mufti in the latter:
So that the Caimacan turned about to feel the Aga of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries
his Pulſe, whom he found not averſe to his Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62930:127"/>
But the Caimacan's Diligence drew upon him the Envy
of the <hi>Kiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar</hi> Aga, who failed not to inform the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
that he held Correſpondence with the Mutineers; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
ſo far upon his credulous Mind, as to prevail with him
to give Orders for ſecuring the Caimacan; which was not long
uneffected, and he committed Priſoner to the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> All
this while the Army was advancing, and the Officer ſent
with the Seal and Standard to <hi>Oſman,</hi> met them at <hi>Niſſa,</hi> near
<hi>Sophia,</hi> juſt at the time the Soldiers, in a Tumult, had killed
<hi>Emir</hi> Baſha, and the Treaſurer, whom the Grand Signior had
ordered back to the Army (with ſome others) for having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned

Neither were they idle at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
with ſuch as adhered to him, having on the 4th of <hi>Oct.</hi> held
a Council upon the emergent Conjuncture, they reſolved, as
the beſt Expedient to ſatisfie the Mutineers, to ſend them the
Heads of ſuch as were obnoxious to them; and they began
with that of <hi>Solyman</hi> Baſha, which was diſpatched to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
with an Offer from the Grand Signior of any other, even
thoſe of his own Sons, to appeaſe them. But this would not
do neither; for the Soldiers openly ſaid, <hi>They had not in the leaſt
deſired</hi> Solyman'<hi>s Head, but to have him alive in their Hands, to
give an exact Account of the Money levied last Year, for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the War.</hi> When the Courier that was diſpatched with
<hi>Solyman</hi>'s Head, returned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he found divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſons turned out of their Employments, and no leſs
Confuſion there than before; which the Grand Signior ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
did not ſatisfie the Army, he attempted the cunning
eſt Stratagem to fix himſelf in the Throne that poſſibly could
be deviſed, had it met with a ſuitable Succeſs: He asked to
ſpeak with his Brother <hi>Solyman,</hi> giving thoſe about him to
underſtand, that he meant to recommend his Sons to him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it became him to give way to the Force of his Deſtiny.
But for all that, he foſtered under this Fiction a reſolute Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to take away his own Sons and Brother's Lives; that ſo
the Army might be obliged to continue him at the Helm,
there being no other of the Imperial Line. But the now
Camaican ſuſpecting the Treachery, ordered the <hi>Kiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar</hi> Aga
to go into the Streets, near the Walls of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
the Grand Signior not to make any Attempt againſt
his own Blood; and to forbear giving any Suſpicion, by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to enter into the Apartments of his Sons and Brother;
becauſe that the Janizaries had ſurrounded the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and
would ſurprize him if he did not continue quiet. This Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
being thus interrupted, he found himſelf now excluded
from all Means of maintaining himſelf in the Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and the next Stroak that preſaged his invitable Fate,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62930:128"/>
was, his being given to underſtand, that his Sons were taken
from him, and put under a ſafe Guard, with the greater Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to co-operate for the Brother's Safety. After this he
found himſelf coup'd up within the Confines of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi>
by the Caimacan's Order; and all the Liberty he had left was,
to repair as often as he pleaſed to a <hi>Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

under the Walls of the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> which terminated alſo upon
the 29th of <hi>Oct.</hi> for the Army was now near. Thereupon the
Caimacan, Mufti and Caydelesker, with ſome principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Law, meeting at St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> and having performed
their Devotions, they ſent preſently the <hi>Chiaux-Pachi</hi> to the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> and followed him themſelves. As ſoon as they were
admitted, they required Sultan <hi>Solyman,</hi> who being brought
forth, was immediately placed upon the Throne: He, upon ſo
great and unexpected Tidings, was not at all ruffled or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but with great Modeſty and Humility, laying his Hand
upon his Breaſt, bowed down, and in a few Words render'd
them Thanks; after this he was Proclaimed Emperor through
all the Parts of the City. Yet the diſcontented Janizaries, and
others, were not appeaſed, but a few Perſons of Note more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſacrificed to their Rage, and a Sum of Money diſtributed
among them, brought Things at length into a tolerable State
of Settlement. And now its time we ſhould inſpect a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

it, before the other were in a State to give it Relief: But
the Governour, the Marqueſs <hi>de Borri,</hi> proved ſo reſolute, and
the Garriſon that conſiſted of about 700 Men, ſo obſtinate in
the Defence of it, that they withſtood all the fierce Attacks of
the Infidels till the 22th of <hi>April,</hi> in which time General <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi>
had, having drawn together near 14000 Men, advanced
towards the <hi>Turks,</hi> who, upon Information of their Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Strength raiſed the Siege the next Day: And this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
ſo much more to the Advantage of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in
that (if the latter had not come up in that Nick of Time) the
<hi>Turks</hi> would have been reinforced with 3000 Men that they
hourly expected, and then ſuch an Additional Force would
render the Enterprize very dangerous, when as the <hi>Turks</hi>
were already Superiour in Number to the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But
though this Diſadvantage at the firſt taking of the Field ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Reparation for this Affront, reſolved to attack the Portreſs of
<hi>Opuſch,</hi> a ſmall Place ſituated upon the River <hi>Narenta,</hi> and
actually inveſted it with near 3000 Men; of which General
<hi>Cornaro</hi> had no ſooner Intimation, but he cauſed ſome Troops
to march that way, and having ſent Orders to Chevalier
<hi>Janco,</hi> to repair thither immediately with the <hi>Morlaques,</hi> 3
Gallies, ſeveral Galliots, and ſome other Veſſels for the
Tranſportation of the Troops; The Baſha thereupon was ſo
far from preſuming to proceed on with his Attacks, that he
thought an haſty Retreat the beſt Expedient for himſelf and
Men. Neither did the <hi>Turks</hi> come off with this Fright only,
for the <hi>Morlaques</hi> plundered and reduced to Aſhes the Suburbs
of <hi>Dumno,</hi> ſeveral Villages of that Country, took divers Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
and brought away a vaſt Number of great and ſmall

            <p>Hitherto the <hi>Venetians</hi> were but on the Defenſive in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">

               </note>
but they were reſolved not to continue always ſo; and
therefore General <hi>Cornaro</hi> having Joined the Auxiliary Gallies,
after the neceſſary Preparations, and ſome Difficulties that had
been raiſed concerning the Supream Commands, had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted,
on the 1 of Sept. came in ſight of <hi>Caſtlenovo,</hi> the Capital
City of <hi>St. Sabba,</hi> ſituate upon the Banks of the Canal of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarro,</hi>
3 Miles from its Mouth, and juſt oppoſite to the <hi>Levant</hi>
Sea; But the Wind proving ſomewhat contrary, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
having made ſome Retrenchments, he found great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in landing: However, through the Conſtancy of the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
Troops, who had Orders given them to land nearer the City
than where the firſt Attempt was, all Oppoſition was over-come
after an Onſet of 5 Hours continuance, wherein the Auxiliaries
were ſeconded by Generl <hi>Paulo</hi> with 2 Battalions: Inſomuch
that they made themſelves not only Maſters of the 1ſt Trenches
but alſo the next Day took the 2d from the Enemy, ſo far as
to poſſeſs the Hill <hi>Vencranda</hi> that commands the Place, and
with 2 ſmall Pieces of Cannon drove them out of all the
Houſes without the Circuit of the City. But this was not done
without Loſs on both ſides, while the Bombs, in the mean time,
did great Damage both in the Town and Caſtle; and the Guns
were continually firing, in order to make a Breach, as well as
Mines preparing to ruine ſome works that obſtructed the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
Paſſage. Yet, what from the Attempts made from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
to ſuccour the Place, though ineffectually, and what with
the continual Rains that fell, it was the 28th of <hi>Sept.</hi> before the
Mines were ſprung, which happned to be with good Succeſs;
and made the General prepare all things for an Aſſault. The
Gallies and Galliots began to fire very hard upon the Town,
while the Dragoons, the Troops of <hi>Maltha</hi> and <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62930:129"/>
the Granadeers at the Head of them, attack'd the Breach with
great Reſolutions; but the Beſieged being much more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than was expected, gave them ſuch a vigorous Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as to repulſe, and put them into Diſorder, with the Loſs
of near 200 Men. However, the Officers, by their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
did ſo well encourage the Troops, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Aſſault was made with all poſſible Courage, though without

the Retrenchments of the Beſieged; and the other Troops ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
at the ſame time to ſecond them, they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Maſters of ſome Houſes, which being ſucceeded next
Night by the Surrender of an high Tower upon the Sea,
where the Standard of St. <hi>Mark</hi> was quickly diſplayed, as alſo

next Morning by the <hi>Turks,</hi> they withdrew into the

Conteſtation about the Articles, they gave up the Place to
the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> upon Condition of marching out with their
Arms unmoleſted; though the <hi>Venetian</hi> General had much
ado to ſecure them from the Fury of the <hi>Malteſe,</hi> who being
enraged at the Loſs of divers Knights, would have put all the
Garriſon to the Sword: And the Conqueſt of this Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo much the more glorious, in that it was almoſt taken
in the ſight of the Baſha of <hi>Erzegovina,</hi> who was marching
with 9000 Men to the Relief of it. General <hi>Cornaro</hi> having
giving all neceſſary Orders for the Security of his Conqueſt,
his next Deſign lay upon <hi>Dulcigno;</hi> but the Seaſon being too
far ſpent, and the Auxiliary Gallies bent upon returning Home,
he laid by that Enterprize, contenting himſelf to take in the

it was reſolved on in the King's Council, That the Forces

as if he had a Deſign to lay a formar Siege to it. He found the

               </gap>ing the Approaches by

to extinguiſh the Fire, tho' they were appointed to attend other
Buſineſs, he made Anſwer, That he had a great dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Stable, and that he was not concerned for the reſt. In the

where were his Quarters, and that he would hinder any firing
that way; The Prince ſent him back Word, That he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to him for his Civility; but that he had no fixed Quarters,
and that he was every-where; as he judged neceſſary. And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
in going and coming from one ſide to the other, there
came a Cannon-Bullet that made its firſt bound ſo near him,
that it covered him all over with Duſt: He ſeemed not in any
wiſe concerned, tho' this was his Tryal of Skill, which wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
pleaſed the <hi>Poles</hi> that were near his Perſon. He gave fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inſtances of his Courage upon a Sally the <hi>Turks</hi> made a
Moment after; and he had been the firſt to have made Head
againſt them, if he had not been withheld. The <hi>Turks</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
made an Onſet upon the advanced Guard, and likewiſe
cauſed a Squadron to buckle that came to its Succour: But a
freſh Body of <hi>Polanders</hi> making up, they retreated in good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
the <hi>Poles</hi> were hindred from purſuing them far by ſome
Pieces of Cannon charged with Chain-ſhot.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Seraſquier,</hi> who had ſome time before put Succours into the Place, and who was ſtill hovering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts to obſerve their Motions, had no ſooner Notice of what
had paſſed, but that he ſent for a Body of <hi>Tartars</hi> that were
at ſome diſtance, to come and join him immediately. This
News being come to the King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Ears, who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
towards the <hi>Neiſter,</hi> to aſſiſt the Prince his Son in caſe
of Need; he ſent him Order to draw off his Troops from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cammiec,</hi> and to come and join him. Prince <hi>James</hi> having
hereupon informed the Two Generals of the King his Father's
Pleaſure, he gave a Diſcharge of all his Cannon by way of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62930:131"/>
Farewel, and having drawn them off, placed himſelf in their
Rear. The Baſha of <hi>Caminiec</hi> detach'd ſome Squadrons after
him; but they contented themſelves with giving certain To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of Contempt and Deriſion at the late Enterprize. But
for all this formal Buſtle, the Damage done was inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
inſomuch, that ſome turn'd the Action into a handſome
Ridicule, by ſaying, <hi>That the Bombs of the Chriſtians had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

            <p>Having done with the <hi>Poles,</hi> it might be expected I ſhould ſay ſomething of the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> but you are to note, their time of Action is not come yet: 'Tis true, they took the Field

I need not repeat what the Tranſactions of the laſt were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

on the 4th of <hi>May,</hi> he paſſed an Order in Council, that
his Declaration of Indulgence, ſhould be Read in all Churches
and Chappels, throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> in Time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service, and that all the Biſhops in their reſpective Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
ſhould take Care to have the ſame accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
There is no queſtion to be made, but they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the King's Meaning well enough, and that under a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of Favour to be intended hereby to Proteſtant Diſſenters,
all the Good imaginable was meant to the Roman Catholicks;
and that whatever was intended by it, there was no Good
meant to them, nor their Church; and therefore it was their
Buſineſs to ward off the Blow; which 7 of them endeavoured
to do, in an humble Petition to the King, wherein their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were ſet forth, why they could not comply with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

after it was drawn up, they would let no other ſee it, before it

Circumſtance of it, and that this Diſcontent might have been
read in the Faces of almoſt all Men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Biſhops were Tryed in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term following, at the

as aforeſaid, for their Petition to the King. But how ſecure
ſoever the King and his Chancellor thought themſelves of the
Judges; and though Sir <hi>Robert Wright,</hi> who was Chief Juſtice;
and Sir <hi>Richard Allibone,</hi> a known Papiſt, were Two of them,
yet they were not all of a Piece; for Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powell</hi> both
learnedly and ſtoutly defended the Cauſe of the Biſhops: And,
though I believe the Jury of themſelves, upon conſidering
the Merit of the Cauſe, were ſufficiently diſpoſed to acquit
them, as they did accordingly; yet ſurely, if they had done
otherwiſe, I queſtion whether all the King's Guards could
have ſecured them from the Fury of the People, who were
not a little chafed with theſe Proceedings; and wrought ſuch
Seeds of Diſcontent in the Minds of moſt Men, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
broke forth with a Witneſs. And though it is not to

the Garriſon being unwilling to conflict any longer with the

their Commanders, reſolve to Capitulate, and projected the
Articles upon one of the principal Towers of that City; and
in purſuance of the Agreement made, they marched out, to
the Number of 5000 Men, of whom about 2000 were Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and were convoyed to the <hi>Danube</hi> in Waggons, and

               </gap>ment of 1500 Men,
which made the Siege ſo much the more difficult: However,
the Cannon and Mortars of the Beſiegers began to play on the
16th of <hi>June</hi> in the Morning, in order to make Breaches, and
that with good Succeſs, and burnt abundance of Houſes, the
greateſt Part of the Town being Wooden Buildings; and a
Breach being made large enough to give an Aſſault, it was
reſolved it ſhould be immediately performed, that the <hi>Turks</hi>
might have no Leiſure to come to themſelves, and uſe due
Prevention. The Detachments appointed for this Work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
animated by the Preſence of their Leaders, fell on with
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62930:134"/>
much Courage and Eagerneſs; and, notwithſtanding all the
ſtubborn Oppoſition of the Beſieged, they drove them back,
and made themſelves Maſters of the Breach; while the Sieur
<hi>de Vaubonne,</hi> who commanded the Granadeers, made alſo a
ſecond Attack on the ſide of the River, with the like Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs:
So that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> entring the Town both ways,
they cut in pieces the greateſt part of thoſe they found in
Arms, while the reſt made their eſcape into the Caſtle;
which, though they at firſt made a Shew of Defending, yet
they were forced to ſurrender the ſame on the 21ſt, at Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
            <p>This was no ſooner accompliſhed,<note place="margin">

               </note> but <hi>Illock</hi> was thought on, as fit and neceſſary to be reduced, before the Siege of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade</hi>
were formed: But the <hi>Turks</hi> did not think fit to ſtay for
the coming of Count <hi>Caprara;</hi> and therefore, having firſt ſet
fire to the Town, they entirely abandoned it; as they did
alſo <hi>Peter-Waradin;</hi> whereby the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> found themſelves
Maſters of the <hi>Danube,</hi> as far as <hi>Belgrade;</hi> and having nothing
more to fear from any Garriſon, which they left behind them,
they directed their March, under the Conduct of the Elector
<hi>Bavaria,</hi> (the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> being ſick,) that way. On the
4th of <hi>Aug.</hi> they ſet forward from <hi>Salankemen,</hi> and came on
the 7th within ſight of that part of the <hi>Danube</hi> that forms the
Iſlands of <hi>Zingari;</hi> which, notwithſtanding the Oppoſition
made by the <hi>Turks,</hi> they paſſed; and on the 9th the whole
Army, with the Artillery and Baggage, were encamped on
the farther-Shoar, within 4 Leagues of <hi>Belgrade;</hi> where the
Elector was informed, that there was a Garriſon of 15000
<hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> in the City, but without any Certainty;
and that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army lay near, to cover the Place: But
the Elector advancing, found that the <hi>Turks</hi> had abandoned
their Camp, and had ſet the Suburbs, or Lower Town, on
fire: And about 4000 <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Radziens,</hi> with their Wives
and Children, came to implore His Electoral Highneſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
who gave very ſtrict Orders that none ſhould mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt

            <p>Upon the Day of their Arrival before the Place,<note place="margin">

               </note> the Elector cauſed the Trenches to be opened againſt the Upper Town and Caſtle; and he diſpatched an Expreſs to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to give
the Emperor an Account of the State of Things. The next
Day, being the 12th, in the Evening, the Troops began to
approach towards the Caſtle, and take their Poſts; to hinder
which, the Enemy made a vigorous Sally; but they were at
laſt repulſed, with a greater Loſs to them, than to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi>
Inſomuch, that the Latter ſecured their Poſts, and
opened their Trenches within Muſquet-ſhot of the Walls, and
began to work on 2 Batteries. On the 13th the <hi>Turks</hi> made
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62930:134"/>
a greater Sally, with much the ſame Succeſs; and next Day
they play furiouſly with their Cannon, and threw a great
Quantity of Granadoes and Bombs, which did no great Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
no more than did another Sally they-made. But a
Detachment of the Garriſon of <hi>Temeſwaer,</hi> which the ſame
Day, by the Help of Boats, got into the Caſtle, ſome what
heighten'd their Courage, but it did not at all daunt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers,
who carried on their Works; and on the 17th, by
Break of Day, they began to ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter the Walls of the Caſtle
with 6 Pieces of Cannon; when they underſtood by a Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the Enemy were hard at work in their Mines. The
Workmen of the Beſiegers, by the 17th, carried on the Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
within 10 Paces of the Ditch, tho' not without great Loſs
of Men; and then they began to raiſe 2 new Batteries. The
next Day they poſſeſſed themſelves of a Moſque, on the Brink
of the Ditch: And the Day following they drew 2 Parallel
Lines on the Right and Left, to compaſs a greater Space of
Ground, as well on the ſide of the Caſtle, as the Town; and
made 2 Redoubts to ſupport the Heads of them; which
were performed, in ſpight of all the Oppoſition made by the
Enemy. On the 22th, the Beſiegers having perfected their
Works, the great Cannon and Mortars arrived from <hi>Buda;</hi>
and on the Day following they battered the Caſtle very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,
made divers Breaches, and beat down part of the
Fortifications: And although the <hi>Turks</hi> made a Sally, with an
Intent to attack the Redoubts, they were beaten back again
with great Loſs. Now it was, that the aſſured News was
brought into the Camp, that the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> had killed
3000 of the Enemy; and that the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſet fire to, and
abandoned <hi>Grandiſca, Debitza</hi> and <hi>Jeſnewitz;</hi> as alſo, that
General <hi>Veterani</hi> had taken <hi>Carenſebes,</hi> and the ſtrong Caſtle
of <hi>Salancar.</hi> The Cannon ſtill played furiouſly, with great
Slaughter on both ſides; when on the 24th a Letter was
brought and preſented to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> from <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>

Courage, and by Degrees to retire, and fled into the Caſtle;

the Imperial Arms under the Conduct of Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of

of Succeſs in <hi>Boſnia,</hi> which was in the following Manner. The
Prince upon the 4th of <hi>Nov.</hi> having Notice that 4 or 5000
<hi>Turks</hi> were Encamped about 6 Miles from <hi>Brod,</hi> he marched
with 3000 Horſe and Dragoons all Night to encounter them;
but in the Morning to his no ſmall Surprize, he found himſelf
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62930:136"/>
greatly miſinformed as to the Number, which amounted to
15000 Horſe and Foot, under the Command of the <hi>Baſha</hi> of
that Country. However, calling the Officers about him,
he told them it was to no Purpoſe to think of retreating, as
being too late, by reaſon of their too far Engagement among
the Enemy, but that they muſt now fight for their Lives and
Victory, which was chearfully conſented to: However, before
they had well put themſelves into a Fighting Poſture, the
<hi>Turks</hi> had ſurrounded them, and vigorouſly charged them 4
or 5 times, which was ſuſtained with ſo many brave and bold
Returns, that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſe perceiving themſelves over ſet
fell firſt into Diſorder and then to open Flight, leaving the
Foot to ſhift for themſelves, whoſe Ranks being forced by
the Imperial Horſe breaking in upon them, they were miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
beaten down and ſlain to the Number in all of 15000

But as if Fortune had been now glutted in heaping up of

of <hi>Europe</hi> appear to be little leſs ſo. <hi>France</hi> by the Interval of

between the Imperial and <hi>French</hi> Miniſters about the

the Death of the Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> which hapned <hi>June</hi>
2d. this year, manifeſtly tended to an open Rupture; The
two Candidates for the Electorate were young Prince <hi>Clement</hi>
of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Elector's Brother of that Name, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
was ſupported by <hi>Germany;</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>de Fuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temburg,</hi>
whoſe pretentions were backed by the Crown of
<hi>France.</hi> But though the former made a ſhift to carry it, and
that his Election was confirmed afterwards by the Pope, who
was at no good terms with <hi>France</hi> at this time; yet the <hi>French</hi>
K. concerned himſelf ſo far in the matter, as to make it an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to begin the cruelleſt War that ever happn'd in this part of
the world, &amp; this was ſeconded with a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> from the <hi>French</hi>
K (which indeed, in the right courſe of things, ſhould have been
firſt) ſetting forth the Juſtice of his cauſe; But I hope the world
is ſtill at liberty to believe as little of it as they pleaſe; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

of <hi>Heſſe Caſſell,</hi> the Princes of the) Houſe of <hi>Lunemburg,</hi>
and the P. of <hi>Orange;</hi> under pretence of the Affair of <hi>Cologn,</hi>
as it was in part, but much more about concerting methods
to divert the Storm hanging over our <hi>Britiſh Iſle,</hi> without
disjoynting of which from the <hi>French</hi> intereſt, and ſecuring
of its Religion and Liberties, there was but little likelihood
of preſerving the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> and confining <hi>France</hi> to the
Bounds ſet unto it by former Stipulations and Treaties.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence of this Interview, was, the making mighty Preparations in <hi>Holland,</hi> both by Sea and Land, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any viſible Appearance who they deſigned to make War
upon: And tho' it was ſaid the Heer Van <hi>Citters,</hi> the States
Ambaſſador at <hi>London,</hi> aſſured the King, <hi>England</hi> had nothing
to fear from it; and did inſinuate, that <hi>France</hi> had much
more Reaſon to be allarm'd than he: the Deſign was pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
into another way. Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> while Ambaſſador in
<hi>Holland,</hi> had gained ſome Glimmering of it, by the
Interception of ſome Letters to a certain Perſon in the
Family of the Princeſs of <hi>Orange:</hi> But being ſoon after ſent
in the ſame Quality to <hi>France,</hi> he got a much clearer Light
thereof from one <hi>Verace,</hi> a <hi>Geneveſe</hi> by Birth; The Story
whereof is ſuch as deſerves a more particular Recital. This
ſame Perſon had been formerly Captain of the Guard to the
Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> but happening to kill a Man in a Duel, he
was put out of his Maſter's Favour: However Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> found
a Way, by the Intereſt of the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> who had
bred up his Son, my Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to <hi>Verace</hi> for many Services he had done him there, to
make his Peace again. The <hi>Geneveſe</hi> being thus re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Maſter's Favour, he had a greater Share of it than
ever; and was more particularly intimate with Monſieur <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tink,</hi>
the Prince's Favourite. I could never learn how he put
himſelf out a ſecond time; But ſo it was, that he withdrew
and was upon his Journey to <hi>Geneva,</hi> when, upon the Noiſe
of the Preparations in <hi>Holland,</hi> he writ to Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> then
at <hi>Paris,</hi> that he had ſomething to communicate to the
King, his Maſter, that concerned nothing leſs than his
Crown, and to let him know a Son-in-Law, whom he was
not miſtruſtful enough of. But for the reſt, he would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
the Secret to any other than the King himſelf, if he
were pleaſed to ſend him Orders to come and wait upon
him. Upon this, Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> writ ſeveral Letters to <hi>England,</hi>
but did not receive an Anſwer ſuitable to the Occaſion;
which made both himſelf and the <hi>French</hi> Court much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62930:138"/>
at it. Yet, when they had, in a manner, entirely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced,
and left the King to take his own Meaſures, ſince
he ſeemed to reject theirs, and the Aſſiſtances offered him, it
hapned one Day, that Monſieur <hi>de Croiſſi</hi> being in Diſcourſe
with Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> and interrogating of him concerning the
then State of Things in <hi>England;</hi> the other anſwered, <hi>He had
nothing more to do in the Matter, and durſt not inter meddle any
farther:</hi> But added, <hi>That he believed if the Most Chriſtian
King would order his Ambaſſador to declare to the States the
Part he took in the Affairs of the King, his Maſter; and to threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to attack them, in caſe they attempted any thing against him;
that he would quickly put a Stop to them, and break the Meaſures
of the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>thereupon,</hi> &amp;c. Monſieur <hi>de Croiſſi</hi> took
the Propoſal preſently; and he no ſooner acquainted the
King with it, but he ſent Orders to the Count <hi>d' Avaux,</hi>
to acquaint the States-General with his Mind: And this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
the following Memorial, and unravelled the Myſtery
of <hi>Skelton</hi>'s being recalled, and ſent Priſoner to the <hi>Tower,</hi>
for diſcovering the King's Secrets.</p>

            <p>And becauſe the King would ſeemingly remove all Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he, on the 5th of <hi>Oct.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he would diſſolve the Commiſſion for Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Cauſes; and gave Directions to the Lord Chancellor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
to cauſe the ſame to be forthwith done: But, at
the ſame, it was not declared to be illegal; which was the
only Way to give Satisfaction in reſpect of it. And becauſe
<hi>Magdalen</hi> College in <hi>Oxford</hi> was no leſs aggrieved with the
High Commiſſion than the Biſhops themſelves were, the King,
after having <hi>Oct.</hi> 12th declared his Reſolution to preſerve
the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all its Rights and Immunities,
did, as an Evidence of it, ſignifie his Pleaſure to the
Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> as Viſitor of the ſaid College, to ſettle
the College Regularly and Statutably. Who accordingly, on
the 16th cauſed a Citation to be fixed on the College Gate,
to re-call Dr. <hi>Hough,</hi> and the former Fellows of that Society,
by the 2d of <hi>Nov.</hi> following; and the Biſhop went down ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
to re-inſtate them, and was received with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Joy. But pray mind the Temper of this King; For
an Account coming that very Poſt, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet had
ſuffered very much in a Storm on the 16th of the ſame Month.
<hi>N.</hi> S. and that they would hardly be able to ſail till the
Spring, the Biſhop was re-called to <hi>London,</hi> and the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
deferred. Yet ſoon after, that falſe News being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
the Affection to the Church revived, and ſo the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the College was effected on the 24th of the ſaid Month.
About this time the Queen-Dowager, and others, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
at the Queen's Delivery; as alſo the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> and divers Peers of the Land, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to attend, to hear what the former could ſay concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Birth of the pretended Prince of <hi>WALES.</hi> But
now all Men's Tongues were let looſe againſt the Government;
And my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi>'s being diſmiſſed from his Office
of prime Miniſter and Secretary of State made a mighty
Noiſe. That my Lord is a perſon of vaſt ability is a matter not
to be doubted, and that how various ſoever the reports then
&amp; ſince have been concerning the cauſe of his being laid aſide, I
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62930:141"/>
think it's good manners for us to liſten to the account he was
pleaſed to give himſelf in his Letter of <hi>March,</hi> 23d 1689.

                  <head>The Earl of Sunderland's Letter to a Friend in
London, publiſhed <date>March 23d. 1689.</date>
                  </head>
                  <q>
                     <p>TO comply with what you deſire, I will explain ſome things which we talked of before I left <hi>England.</hi> I have been in a Station of a great noiſe, without Power or
Advantage whilſt I was in it, and to my Ruin now I am out
of it. I know I cannot Juſtifie my ſelf by ſaying, though it
is true, that I thought to have prevented much Miſchief;
for when I found that I could not, I ought to have quitted
the Service; Neither is it an Excuſe that I have got none of
thoſe things which uſually engage men in publick Affairs: My
Quality is the ſame it ever was, and my Eſtate much worſe,
even ruin'd, tho' I was born to a very conſiderable one,
which I am aſhamed to have ſpoiled, though not ſo much as
if I had encreaſed it by indirect Means. But to go on to
what you expect: The Pretence to a Diſpenſing Power being
not only the firſt thing which was much diſliked ſince the
Death of the late King, but the Foundation of all the reſt, I
ought to begin with that which I had ſo little to do with, that
I never heard it ſpoken of till the time of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
when that the King told ſome of the Council, of which I
was one, that he was reſolved to give Employments to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks, it being fit that all Perſons ſhould ſerve who
could be uſeful, and on whom he might depend. I think
every Body adviſed him againſt it, but with little effect, as
was ſoon ſeen: That Party was ſo well pleaſed with what the
King had done, that they perſuaded him to mention it in his
Speech at the next Meeting of the Parliament, which he
did, after many Debates whether it was proper or not: In
all which I oppoſed it, as is known to very conſiderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſome of which were of another Opinion; for I thought
it would engage the King too far, and it did give ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to the Parliament, that it was thought neceſſary to
prorogue it; <hi>after which, the King fell immediately to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the Diſpenſing Power, the moſt Chinerical thing that was
ever thought of, and muſt be ſo till the Government here is as
Abſolute is in</hi> Turkey, <hi>all Power being included in that one.</hi>
This is the Senſe I ever had of it, and when I heard Lawyers
defend it; I never changed my Opinion or Language; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it went on, moſt of the Judges being for it, and was
the chief Buſineſs of the State, till it was looked on as ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Then the Eccleſiaſtical Court was ſet up, in which
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:62930:141"/>
there being ſo many conſiderable Men of ſeveral kinds, I
could have but a ſmall part; and that after Lawyers had told
the King it was Legal, and nothing like the High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
Court, I can moſt truly ſay, and it is well known, that
for a good while I defended <hi>Magdalen College</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rely by Care
and Induſtry, and have hundreds of times begged of the
King never to grant <hi>Mandates,</hi> or to change any thing in the
regular Courſe of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, which he often
thought reaſonable, and then by perpetual Importunities was
prevailed upon againſt his own Senſe, which was the very
Caſe of <hi>Magdalen College,</hi> as of ſome others.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things which I endeavoured, though without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, drew upon me the Anger and Ill will of many about the King. The next thing to be tried, was to take off the Penal
Laws and the Teſts, ſo many having promiſed their Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
towards it, that His Majeſty thought it feaſible; but he
ſoon found it was not to be done by that Parliament, which
made all the Catholicks deſire it might be diſſolv'd, which I
was ſo much againſt, that they complained of me to the
King, as a Man who ruined all his Deſigns by oppoſing the
only thing could carry them on; Liberty of Conſcience being
the Foundation on which he was to build. That it was firſt
offered at by the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> who by it had done the work,
even in the late King's time, if it had not been for his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the weakneſs of his Miniſters; Yet I hindred the
Diſſolution ſeveral Weeks, by telling the King that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in Being would do every thing he could deſire, but
the taking off the Penal Laws and the Teſts, or the allowing
his Diſpenſing Power, and that any other Parliament, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
ſuch a one could be had as was propoſed, would probably
never repeal thoſe Laws; and if they did, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
never do any thing for the ſupport of the Government,
whatever exigency it might be in. At that time the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> was ſick, upon which I ſaid often to the King, That if
he ſhould die, it would be impoſſible for His Majeſty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Peace of Chriſtendom, that a War muſt be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſuch a one as would chiefly concern <hi>England;</hi> and
that if the preſent Parliament continued, he might be ſure
of all the Help and Service he could wiſh; but in caſe he
diſſolv'd it, he muſt give over all Thoughts of Foreign Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
for no other would ever aſſiſt him, but on ſuch Terms as
would ruine the Monarchy; ſo that from Abroad or at Home,
he would be deſtroy'd, if the Parliament were broken, and any
accident ſhould happen, of which there were many, to make
the Aid of his People neceſſary to him. This and much more
I ſaid to him ſeveral times privately, and in the hearing of
others. But being over-power'd, the Parliament was broke, the
Cloſetting went on, and a new one was to be choſen: who was
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62930:142"/>
to get by Cloſetting, I need not ſay; but it was certainly not
I, nor any of my Friends; many of them ſuffered, who I
would fain have ſaved, and yet I muſt confeſs with grief, that
when the King was reſolv'd, and there was no remedy, I did
not quit, as I ought to have done, but ſerved on in order to
the calling another Parliament. In the midſt of all the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for it, and whilſt the Corporations were regulating,
the King thought fit to order his Declarations to be read in
all Churches, of which I moſt ſolemnly proteſt, I never heard
one word, till the King directed it in Council; That drew on
the Petition of my Lord the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the
other Lords the Biſhops, and their Proſecution, which I was
ſo openly againſt, that by arguing continually to ſhew the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
and the Imprudence of it, I brought the Fury of the
<hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> upon me to ſuch a degree, and ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly,
that I was juſt ſinking, and I wiſh I had then ſunk:
But whatever I did fooliſhly to preſerve myſelf, I continued
ſtill to be the Object of their hatred, and I reſolv'd to ſerve the
Publick as well as I could, which I am ſure moſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Proteſtants then at Court can teſtifie; and ſo can
one very eminent man of the Country, whom I would have
perſwaded to come into buſineſs, which he might have done,
to have helped me to reſiſt the violence of thoſe in Power; But
he deſpaired of being able to do any good, and therefore
would not engage. Sometime after came the firſt News of the
Prince's deſigns, which were not then look'd on, as they have
proved, no body foreſeeing the Miracles he has done by his
wonderful Prudence, Conduct, and Courage, for the greateſt
thing which has been undertaken theſe thouſand years, or
perhaps ever, could not be effected without Vertues hardly to
be imagined till ſeen nearer hand. Upon the firſt thought of
his coming I laid hold of the opportunity to preſs the King to
do ſeveral things which I would have had done ſooner; the
chief of which were to reſtore <hi>Magdalen College,</hi> and all other
Eccleſiaſtical Preferments, which had been diverted from
what they were intended for, to take off my Lord Biſhop of
<hi>London</hi>'s Suſpenſion, to put the Counties into the ſame hands
they were in ſome time before, to annul the Eccleſiaſtical
Court, and to reſtore entirely all the Corporations of <hi>England.</hi>
Theſe things were done effectually by the help of ſome about
the King;<note place="margin">☞</note> and it was then thought, I had deſtroyed my ſelf,
by enraging again the whole Roman Catholick Party to ſuch
a height as had not been ſeen: They diſperſed Libels of me
every day, told the King that I betrayed him, that I ruined
him by perſwading him to make ſuch ſhameful Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;<note place="margin">☜</note>
but moſt of all by hindring the ſecuring the chief of
the diſaffected Nobility and Gentry, which was propoſed as
a certain way to break all the Prince's Meaſures; and by advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:62930:142"/>
His Majeſty to call a Free-Parliament, and to depend
upon that, rather than upon Foreign Aſſiſtance. It is true I
did give him thoſe Counſels which were called weak to the laſt
Moment he ſuffered me in his Service; then I was accuſed
of holding Correſpondence with the Prince, and it was every
where ſaid amongſt them, That no better could be expected
from a Man ſo related as I was to the <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and ſo allied to Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the Marqueſs of
<hi>Halifax.</hi> After this, Accuſations of High Treaſon were brought
againſt me, which, with ſome other Reaſons relating to Affairs
Abroad, drew the King's Diſpleaſure upon me, ſo as to turn me
out of all without any Conſideration, and yet I thought I
eſcaped well, expecting nothing leſs than the loſs of my Head,
as my Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> can tell, and I believe none about the
Court thought otherwiſe; nor had it been otherwiſe, if my
Diſgrace had been deferred a day longer; all things being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for it: I was put out the 27th of <hi>October,</hi> the Roman
Catholicks having been two Months working the King up to
it, without Intermiſſion, beſides the ſeveral Attacks they
had made upon me before, and the unuſal Aſſiſtance they
obtained to do what they thought ſo neceſſary for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on their Affairs, of which they never had greater
hope than at that time, as may be remembred by any who
were then at <hi>London.</hi> But you deſired I would ſay ſomething
to you of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which I will do in very few Words, but
exactly true.</p>
                     <p>My Lord <hi>Tyrconnell</hi> has been ſo abſolute there, that I never had the Credit to make an Enſign, er keep one in, nor to preſerve ſome of my Friends, for whom I was much concern'd,
from the laſt Oppreſſion and Injuſtice, tho' I endeavoured it
to the utmoſt of my Power; But yet with Care and Diligence,
being upon the place, and he abſent, I diverted the Calling a
Parliament there, which was deſigned to alter the Acts of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement.
Chief Juſtice <hi>Nugent,</hi> and Baron <hi>Rice</hi> were ſent
over with a Draught of an Act for that purpoſe, furniſhed
with all the preſſing Arguments could be thought on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
the King; and I was offered forty thouſand pounds for
my Concurrence, which I told to the King, and ſhewed him at
the ſame time the Injuſtice of what was propoſed to him, and
the prejudice it would be to that Country, with ſo good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
that he reſolved not to think of it that Year, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
never. This I was help'd in by ſome Friends, particularly
my Lord <hi>Godolphin,</hi> who knows it to be true, and ſo do the
Judges before named, and ſeveral others.</p>
                     <p>I cannot omit ſaying ſomething of <hi>France,</hi> there having been ſo much talk of a League between the two Kings. I do proteſt I never knew of any; and if there were ſuch a thing,
it was carried on by other ſort of Men laſt Summer. Indeed
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62930:143"/>
                        <hi>French</hi> Ships were offered to joyn with our Fleet, and they
were refuſed; ſince the noiſe of the Prince's Deſign, more
Ships were offered, and it was agreed how they ſhould be
commanded, if ever deſired. I oppoſed to Death the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
of them, as well as any Aſſiſtance of Men, and can
ſay moſt truly, that I was the Principal Means of hindring
both, by the help of ſome Lords, with whom I conſulted
every day, and they with me, to prevent what we thought
would be of great prejudice, if not ruinous to the Nation. If
the Report is true, of Men, Ships, and Money intended
lately for <hi>England</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> it was agreed upon ſince I
was out of Buſineſs, or without my Knowledge; if it had
been otherwiſe, I believe no Body thinks my Diſgrace would
have happened. My greateſt Misfortune has been to be
thought the Promoter of thoſe Things I oppoſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted,
whilſt ſome I could name have been the Inventors
and Contrivers of what they have had the Art to lay upon
others; and I was often fooliſhly willing to bear what my
Maſter would have done, tho' I uſed all poſſible Endeavours
againſt it. I lie under many other Misfortunes and Afflictions
extream heavy, but I hope they have brought me to reflect
on the occaſion of them, the looſe, negligent, unthinking Life
I have hitherto led, having been perpetually hurried away
from all good Thoughts, by Pleaſure, Idleneſs, the Vanity of
the Court, or by Buſineſs: I hope, I ſay, that I ſhall overcome
all the Diſorders my former Life had brought upon me, and
that I ſhall ſpend the remaining part of it in Begging of
Almighty God, that he will pleaſe either to put an end to
my Sufferings, or to give me Strength to bear them; one
of which he will certainly grant to ſuch as rely on him,
which I hope I do, with the Submiſſion that becomes a
good Chriſtian I would enlarge on this Subject, but that I fear
you might think ſomething elſe to be the reaſon of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a true Senſe of my Faults and that obliges me to reſtrain
my ſelf at preſent. I believe you will repent in having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
me to give you this Account, but I cannot the doing
of what you deſire of me.</p>

            <p>What followed next, were various Reports concerning the loſs the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet had ſuſtained in a Storm, which, to amuſe us, was heightned in their own Prints; and about the ſame
time a Parcel of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declarations being
intercepted in <hi>London,</hi> when that Expreſſion came to be read,
<hi>That the Prince was moſt earneſtly invited hither by divers of the

others,</hi> the King ſent for ſome of the Biſhops, and required a

Invaſion: But they refuſed to do it, as contrary to their
Privilege of Peerage, and their Profeſſion, in promoting
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62930:143"/>
War againſt a Prince ſo nearly allyed to the Crown, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
deſired that might be left to a Free Parliament; at

The Wind had been now for almoſt 3 Weeks perpetually

on the 3d of <hi>Nov.</hi> between 10 and 11 a Clock, the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fleet was diſcovered about Half-Seas over, ſteering a Channel
Courſe Weſtward, the Wind at E. N. E. a freſh Gale, and on
the 5th paſſing by <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> it being hazy Weather, they
overſhot <hi>Torbay,</hi> where the Prince deſigned to Land: But
about 9 a Clock the Weather cleared up, and the Wind chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to W. S. W. and the Fleet ſtood Eaſtward with a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Gale,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> lands in <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> being about 4 or 500 Sail, whereof there was 51
Men of War, and 18 Fireſhips. This Change of Wind was
obſerved by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to be of no long Duration, but it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
choped into another Corner, when it had executed
its Commiſſion. While the Prince was landing his Army, and
advanced to <hi>Exeter,</hi> the King was vainly endeavouring to
ſooth the People, by redreſſing the Diſorders committed by
the Soldiers, and Promiſes of a Parliament, which ſeveral
of the Biſhops and Nobility petitioned might be a Free Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
one in all its Circumſtances; wherewith His Majeſty, to
diſcover his good Diſpoſition, did not appear, by his Anſwer,
to be well-pleaſed: And all Endeavours were uſed, to make
the Prince and his Army contemptible in the ſight of the
People, by Printing a Liſt of them, and giving out, That none
of the Nobility and Gentry, but only a few Rabble, appeared
for him, and that the Prince's Declaration might be kept cloſe
from the Knowledge of the People; yet it did not continue
ſo long with the Prince, whoſe Army was conſiderably aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the Junction of divers Perſons of good Quality
with him. Neither could the Court any longer keep the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
ſuppreſs'd; and therefore they ſuffered the ſame to
be Printed, with a Preface, and ſome modeſt Remarks, as the
Author pretends on it. VVhich Declaration was this that
follows:</p>

                        <head>The Declaration of His Highneſs, WILLIAM
HENRY, by the Grace of God, Prince of
Orange, &amp;c. of the Reaſons inducing him to
appear in Arms in the Kingdom of ENGLAND,
for preſerving of the Proteſtant Religion, and
for Reſtoring of the Laws and Liberties of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland and Ireland.</head>
                        <p>I. IT is both certain and evident to all Men, That the Publick Peace and Happineſs of any State or Kingdom cannot be preſerved, where the Laws, Liberties, and Cuſtoms
Eſtabliſhed by the Lawful Authority in it, are openly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
and annulled: More eſpecially where the Alteration
of <hi>Religion</hi> is endeavoured, and that a Religion, which is
contrary to Law, is endeavoured to be introduced: Upon
which thoſe who are moſt immediately concerned in it, are
indiſpenſably bound to endeavour to maintain and preſerve
the Eſtabliſhed Laws, Liberties, and Cuſtoms, and above all
the <hi>Religion</hi> and Worſhip of God, that is Eſtabliſhed among
them; and to take ſuch an Effectual Care, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the ſaid State or Kingdom, may neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of their <hi>Religion,</hi> nor of their Civil Rights; which
is ſo much the more neceſſary, becauſe the Greatneſs and
Security both of Kings, Royal Families, and of all ſuch as
are in Authority, as well as the Happineſs of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and People, depend, in a moſt eſpecial manner, upon the
exact Obſervation and Maintenance of theſe their Laws,
Liberties and Cuſtoms.</p>
                        <p>II. Upon theſe Grounds it is, that we can't any longer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to declare, That, to our great Regret, we ſee that thoſe Counſellors, who have now the chief Credit with the King,
have overturned the Religion, Laws and Liberties of theſe
Realms, and ſubjected them in all things relating to their
Conſciences, Liberties and Properties, to Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that not only by ſecret and indirect VVays, but
in an open and undiſguiſed Manner.</p>
                        <p>III. Theſe Evil Counſellors, for the Advancing and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring this with ſome plauſible Pretexts, did invent and ſet on Foot the King's <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> by Virtue of which
they pretend, that, according to <hi>Law,</hi> he can ſuſpend and
diſpenſe with the Execution of the <hi>Laws</hi> that have been
enacted by the Authority of the King and Parliament, for
the Security and Happineſs of the Subject, and ſo have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thoſe laws of no effect; though there is nothing more
certain, than that as no Laws can be made but by the joynt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:62930:144"/>
Concurrence of the King and Parliament, ſo likewiſe Laws
ſo Enacted, which ſecure the Publick Peace and Safety
of the Nation, and the Lives and Liberties of every Subject
in it, cannot be repealed or ſuſpended but by the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                        <p>IV. For though the King may pardon the Puniſhment that a Tranſgreſſor has incurred, and for which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as in the Caſes of Treaſon or Felony; yet it cannot
be with any colour of Reaſon inferred from thence, that the
King can entirely ſuſpend the Execution of thoſe Laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to Treaſon or Felony; unleſs it is pretended, that he
is cloathed with a Deſpotick and Arbitrary Power; and that
the Lives, Liberties, Honours and Eſtates of the Subjects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
wholly on his Good Will and Pleaſure, and are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubject to him; which muſt infallibly follow, on the King's
having a Power to ſuſpend the Execution of the Laws, and
to diſpenſe with them.</p>
                        <p>V. Thoſe Evil Counſellors, in order to the giving ſome Credit to this ſtrange and execrable Maxim, have ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the Matter, that they have obtained a Sentence
from the Judges, declaring, That this Diſpenſing Power is a
Right belonging to the Crown; as if it were in the Power
of the Twelve Judges to offer up the Laws, Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the whole Nation to the King, to de diſpoſed of
by him Arbitrarily and at his Pleaſure, and expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Laws Enacted for the Security of the Subjects. In
order to the obtaining of this Judgment, thoſe Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
did before-hand examine ſecretly the Opinion of the
Judges; and procured ſuch of them as could not in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
concur in ſo pernicious a Sentence, to be turned
out, and others to be ſubſtituted in their Rooms; till by
the Changes that were made in the Courts of Judicature,
they at laſt obtained that Judgment. And they have raiſed
ſome to thoſe Truſts, who make open Profeſſion of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Religion, tho' thoſe are by Law render'd incapable of
all ſuch Employments.</p>
                        <p>VI. It is alſo manifeſt and notorious, that as His Majeſty was, upon his coming to the Crown, received and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all the Subjects of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as
their King, without the leaſt Oppoſition, tho' he made then
open Profeſſion of the Popiſh Religion; ſo he did then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and ſolemnly ſwear at his Coronation, That he would
maintain His Subjects in the free Enjoyment of their Laws
and Liberties: And in particular, That he would maintain
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it was Eſtabliſhed by Law. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
certain, that there have been at divers and ſundry times
ſeveral Laws Enacted for the Preſervation of thoſe Rights and
Liberties, and of the Proteſtant Religion: And, among other
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:62930:145"/>
Securities, it has been Enacted, That all Perſons whatſoever
that are advanced to any Eccleſiaſtical Dignity, or to bear
Office in the Univerſity; as likewiſe all others that ſhould
be put into any Employment, Civil or Military, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that they were not Papiſts, but were of the Proteſtant
Religion; and that by their Taking of the Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
and Supremacy, and the Teſt; yet theſe evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
have, in effect, annulled and aboliſhed all thoſe Laws
which relate to Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Employment.</p>
                        <p>VII. In order to Eccleſiaſtical Dignities and Offices, they have not only without any colour of Law, but againſt moſt expreſs Laws to the contrary, ſet up a Commiſſion, of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
number of Perſons, to whom they committed the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance
and Direction of all Eccleſiaſtical Matters; in the
which Commiſſion there has been, and ſtill is one of His
Majeſty's Miniſters of State, who makes now publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the Popiſh Religion, and who at the time of his
firſt profeſſing it, declared that for a great while before he
had believed that to be the only true Religion. By all this,
the deplorable State to which the Proteſtant Religion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
is apparent, ſince the Affairs of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
are now put into the Hands of Perſons who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of a Commiſſion that is manifeſtly illegal, and who
have executed it contrary to all Law; and that now one of
their chief Members has abjured the Proteſtant Religion, and
declared himſelf a Papiſt; by which he is become uncapable
of holding any Publick Imployment. The ſaid Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
have hitherto given ſuch Proof of their Submiſſion to
the Directions given them, that there is no Reaſon to doubt,
but they will ſtill continue to promote all ſuch Deſigns as
will be moſt agreeable to them. And thoſe Evil Counſellors
take care to raiſe none to any Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, but
Perſons that have no Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and
that hide their unconcernedneſs for it, under the ſpecious
pretence of Moderation. The ſaid Commiſſioners have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended
the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> only becauſe he refuſed to
obey an Order that was ſent him to ſuſpend a worthy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
without ſo much as citing him before him to make his
own Defence, or obſerving the common Forms of Proceſs.
They have turnd out a Preſident choſen by the Fellows of
<hi>Magdalen</hi> College, and afterwards all the Fellows of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
without ſo much as citing them before any Court that
could take legal Cogniſance of that Affair, or obtaining any
Sentence againſt them by a competent Judge. And the only
Reaſon that was given for turning them out was, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to chuſe for their Preſident, a perſon that was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them by the Inſtigation of thoſe Evil Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
though the Right of a Free Election belonged undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:62930:145"/>
to them. But they were turned out of their Free-Holds
contrary to Law, and to that expreſs proviſion in the
<hi>Magna Charta, That no Man ſhall loſe Life or Goods, but by
the Law of the Land.</hi> And now theſe Evil Counſellors have
put the ſaid College wholly into the Hands of Papiſts, tho',
as is aboveſaid, they are incapable of all ſuch Employments,
both by the Law of the Land, and the Statutes of the College.
Theſe Commiſſioners have alſo cited before them all the
Chancellors and Arch Deacons of <hi>England,</hi> requiring them
to certifie to them the Names of all ſuch Clergy-men as have
Read the King's <hi>Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and of
ſuch as have not Read it; without conſidering that the
Reading thereof was not enjoyned the Clergy by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
who are their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. The Illegality and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competency
of the ſaid Court of the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
was ſo notoriouſly known, and it did ſo evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that it tended to the Subverſion of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that the Moſt Reverend Father in God, <hi>William</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate and Metropolitan of <hi>England,</hi>
ſeeing that it was raiſed for no other End but to oppreſs
ſuch Perſons as were of eminent Vertue, Learning and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
refuſed to ſit, or to concur in it.</p>
                        <p>VIII. And tho' there are many expreſs Laws againſt, all Churches or Chapels, for the Exerciſe of the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and alſo againſt all Monaſteries and Convents, and
more particularly againſt the Order of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> yet thoſe
Evil Counſellors have procured Orders for the Building of
ſeveral Churches and Chapels for the Exerciſe of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
They have alſo procured divers Monaſteries to be
Erected; and, in contempt of the Laws, they have not only
ſet up ſeveral Colleges of <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in divers places, for the
corrupting of the Youth, but have raiſed up one of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to be a Privy-Counſellor, and a Miniſter of State. By all
which they do evidently ſhew, that they are reſtrained by
no Rules of Law whatſoever, but that they have ſubjected
the Honours and Eſtates of the Subjects, and the Eſtabliſhed
Religion to a Deſpotick Power, and to Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
In all which they are ſerved and ſeconded by thoſe
Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners.</p>
                        <p>IX. They have alſo followed the ſame Methods, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Civil Affairs; for they have procured Orders to examine all Lord-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, Sheriffs,
Juſtices of Peace, and all others that were in any Publick
Employment, if they would concur with the King in the
Repeal of the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws;</hi> and all ſuch whoſe
Conſciences did not ſuffer them to comply with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
were turned out, and others were put in their Places,
whom they believed would be more compliant to them in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:62930:146"/>
their Deſigns of defeating the Intent and Execution of thoſe
Laws, which had been made with ſo much Care and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for the Security of the Proteſtant Religion. And in
many of theſe Places they have put profeſſed Proteſtants,
tho' the Law has diſabled them. and warranted the Subjects
not to have any Regard to their Orders.</p>
                        <p>X. They have alſo invaded the Privileges, and ſeized on the Charters of moſt of thoſe Towns that have a Right to be Repreſented by their Burgeſſes in Parliament; and have
procured Surrenders to be made of them, by which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
in them have delivered up all their Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
to be diſpoſed of at the Pleaſure of thoſe Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors;
who have thereupon placed new Magiſtrates in thoſe
Towns, ſuch as they can moſt entirely confide in; and in
many of them they put Popiſh Magiſtrates, notwithſtanding
the Incapacities under which the Law has put them.</p>
                        <p>XI. And whereas no Nation whatſoever can ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Adminiſtration of good and impartial Juſtice, upon which Mens Lives, Liberties, Honours and Eſtates do depend,
thoſe Evil Counſellors have ſubjected theſe to an Arbitrary
and Deſpotick Power: In the moſt important Affairs, they
have ſtudied to diſcover before-hand the Opinions of the
Judges; and have turned out ſuch as they found would not
conform themſelves to their Intentions, and have put others
in their Places, of whom they were more aſſured, without
having any regard to their Abilities: And they have not
ſtuck to raiſe even profeſſed Papiſts to the Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature,
notwithſtanding their Incapacity by Law, and that
no Regard is due to any Sentences flowing from them,
They have carried this ſo far, as to deprive ſuch Judges, who,
in common Adminiſtration of Juſtice, ſhewed that they
were governed by their Conſciences, and not by the Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions
which the others gave them. By which it is apparent,
that they deſign to render themſelves the Abſolute Maſters
of the Lives, Honours and Eſtates of the Subjects, of what
Rank or Dignity ſoever they may be; and that without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Regard either to the Equity of the Cauſe, or to the
Conſciences of the Judges, whom they will have to ſubmit
in all things to their own VVill and Pleaſure; hoping by ſuch
Ways to intimidate thoſe who are in Employment, as alſo
ſuch others, as they ſhall think fit, to put in the room of thoſe
whom they have turned out; and to make them ſee what
they muſt look for, if they ſhould at any time act in the
leaſt contrary to their good liking; and that no Failings in
that kind are pardoned in any Perſon whatſoever. A great
deal of Blood has been ſhed in many Places of the Kingdom,
by Judges governed by thoſe Evil Counſellors, againſt all the
Rules and Forms of Law, without ſo much as ſuffering the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:62930:146"/>
Perſons that were accuſed to plead in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
                        <p>XII. They have alſo, by putting the Adminiſtration of Civil Juſtice in the Hands of Papiſts, brought all the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Civil Juſtice into great Uncertainties; with how
much Exactneſs and Juſtice ſoever theſe Sentences may have
been given. For ſince the Laws of the Land do not only
exclude Papiſts from all Places of Judicature, but have
put them under an Incapacity, none are bound to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or to obey their Judgments, and all Sentences given
by them are null and void of themſelves: So that all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who have been caſt in Trials before ſuch Popiſh Judges,
may juſtly look on their pretended Sentences, as having no
more Force than the Sentences of any private and unautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
Perſon whatſoever. So deplorable is the Caſe of the
Subjects, who are obliged to anſwer to ſuch Judges, that
muſt in all things ſtick to the Rules which are ſet them by
thoſe Evil Counſellors, who as they raiſed them up to
thoſe Employments, ſo can turn them out at Pleaſure; and
who can never be eſteemed lawful Judges; ſo that all
their Sentences are in the Conſtruction of the Law, of no
Force and Efficacy. They have likewiſe diſpoſed of all
Military Employments, but have in particular provided,
that they ſhould be diſarm'd; yet they, in contempt of
theſe Laws, have not only armed the Papiſts, but have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
raiſed them up to the greateſt Military Truſt, both by
Sea and Land, and that Strangers as well as Natives, and
Iriſh as well as Engliſh, that ſo by thoſe means, having
rendred themſelves Maſters both of the Affairs of the
Church, of the Government of the Nation, and of the
Courts of Juſtice, and ſubjected them all to a Deſpotick
and Arbitrary Power, they might be in a capacity to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and execute their wicked Deſigns, by the Aſſiſtance of
the Army, and thereby to enſlave the Nation.</p>
                        <p>XIII. The Diſmal Effects of this Subverſion of the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Religion, Laws and Liberties in <hi>England,</hi> appear more evidently to us, by what we ſee done in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
where the whole Government is put in the Hands of Papiſts,
and where all the Proteſtant Inhabitants are under the daily
Fears of what may be juſtly apprehended from the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power which is ſet up there; which has made great
numbers of them leave that Kingdom, and abandon their
Eſtates in it, remembring well that cruel and bloody Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre
which fell out in that Iſland in the Year 1641.</p>
                        <p>XIV. Thoſe Evil Counſellors have alſo prevailed with the King to declare in <hi>Scotland,</hi> That he is cloathed with <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power,</hi> and that all the Subjects are bound <hi>to Obey him
without Reſerve:</hi> Upon which he aſſumed an Arbitrary
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:62930:147"/>
Power both over the Religion and Laws of the Kingdom;
from all which it's apparent, what is to be looked for in
<hi>England,</hi> as ſoon as Matters are duly prepared for it.</p>
                        <p>XV. Thoſe great and inſufferable Oppreſſions, and the open Contempt of all Law, together with the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſad Conſequences that muſt certainly follow
upon it, have put the Subjects under great and juſt Fears;
and have made them look after Lawful Remedies as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
of in all Nations; yet all has been without effect.
And thoſe Evil Counſellors have endeavoured to make all
Men apprehend the Loſs of their Lives, Liberties, Honours,
and Eſtates, if they ſhould go about to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from this Oppreſſion, by Petition, Repreſentations,
or other Means Authorized by <hi>Law.</hi> Thus did they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other
Biſhops, who having offered a moſt Humble Petition to
the King, in Terms full of Reſpect, and not exceeding the
Number limited by Law, in which they ſet forth, in ſhort,
the Reaſons for which they could not obey that Order,
which, by the Inſtigation of thoſe Evil Counſellors, was
ſent them, requiring them to appoint their Clergy to read
in their Churches the Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi>
were ſent to Priſon, and afterwards brought to a Trial, as if
they had been guilty of ſome enormous Crime. They were
not only obliged to defend themſelves in that purſuit, but
to appear before profeſſed Papiſts, who had not taken the
Teſt, and by conſequence were Men whoſe Intereſt led
them to condemn them; and the Judges that gave their
Opinions in their Favours, were thereupon turned out.</p>
                        <p>XVI. And yet it cannot be pretended, that any Kings, how great ſoever their Power has been, and how Arbitrary and Deſpotick ſoever they have been in the Exerciſe of it,
have ever reckoned it a Crime for their Subjects to come in
all Submiſſion and Reſpect, and in a due number, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the Limits of the Law, and repreſent to them the
Reaſons that made it impoſſible for them to obey their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Thoſe Evil Counſellors have alſo treated a Peer of
the Realm as a Criminal, only becauſe he ſaid, <hi>That the
Subjects were not bound to obey the Orders of a Popiſh Juſtice
of Peace;</hi> though it's Evident, that they being by Law ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
incapable of all ſuch Truſts, no regard is due to their
Orders. This being the Security which the People have by
the Law for their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates, that they are
not to be ſubjected to the Arbitrary Proceedings of Papiſts,
that are contrary to <hi>Law,</hi> put into any Employments Civil
or Military.</p>
                        <p>XVII. Both we our ſelves, and our deareſt and moſt entirely Beloved Conſort the Princeſs, have endeavoured to <pb n="277" facs="tcp:62930:147"/>
ſignifie, in Terms full of Reſpect to the King, the juſt and
deep Regret which all theſe Proceedings have given us; and
in Compliance with His Majeſty's Deſires ſignified to us, We
declared both by Word of Mouth, to his Envoy, and in
Writing, what our Thoughts were, touching the Repealing
of the <hi>Teſt and Penal Laws;</hi> which we did in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that we hop'd we had propoſed an Expedient, by
which the Peace of thoſe Kingdoms, and a happy Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among the Subjects of all Perſwaſions, might have been
ſettled; but thoſe Evil Counſellors have put ſuch ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
on theſe our good Intentions, that they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to alienate the King more and more from us; as
if we had deſigned to diſturb the Quiet and Happineſs of
the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>XVIII. The laſt and great Remedy for all theſe Evils, is the <hi>Calling of a Parliament,</hi> for ſecuring the Nation againſt thoſe evil Practices of thoſe wicked Counſellors; but this
could not be yet compaſſed, nor can be eaſily brought about.
For thoſe Men apprehending, that a Lawful Parliament
being once Aſſembled, they would be brought to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for all their open Violations of Law, and for their
Plots and Conſpiracies againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and
the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
under the ſpecious Pretence of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi>
firſt to ſow Diviſions among Proteſtants, between thoſe of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Diſſenters: The Deſign being
laid to engage Proteſtants, that are equally concerned to
preſerve themſelves from Popiſh Oppreſſion, into Mutual
Quarrellings, that ſo by theſe, ſome Advantages may be
given to them to bring about their Deſigns; and that both
in the Election of Members of Parliament, and afterwards
in the Parliament it ſelf. For they ſee well, that if all
Proteſtants could enter into a good underſtanding one with
another, and concur together in the preſerving of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
it would not be poſſible for them to compaſs their
wicked Ends. They have alſo required all Perſons in the
ſeveral Counties of <hi>England,</hi> that either were in any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
or were in any conſiderable Eſteem, to declare
before-hand, that they would concur in the Repeal of the
Penal Laws; and that they would give their Voices in the
Elections to Parliament, only for ſuch as would concur in
it: Such as would not thus preingage themſelves, were
turn'd out of all Employments; and others who entred into
thoſe Engagements were put in their Places, many of them
being Papiſts: And contrary to the Charters and Priviledges
of thoſe Boroughs that have a Right to ſend Burgeſſes to
Parliament, they have ordered ſuch Regulations to be made
as they thought fit and neceſſary, for aſſuring themſelves of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:62930:148"/>
all the Members that are to be choſen by thoſe Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and by this means they hope to avoid that Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment
which they have deſerved; tho' it is apparent, that
all Acts made by Popiſh Magiſtrates are null and void of
themſelves: So that no Parliament can be Lawful, for which
the Elections and Returns are made by Popiſh Magiſtrates,
Sheriffs and Mayors of Towns; and therefore as long as the
Authority and Magiſtracy is in ſuch Hands, it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to have any Lawful Parliament. And tho', according
to the Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
Cuſtom, all Elections of Parliament-Men ought to
be made with an entire Liberty, without any ſort of Force,
or the requiring the Electors to chuſe ſuch Perſons as ſhall
be named to them; and the Perſons thus freely Elected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ought to give their Opinions freely, upon all Matters that
are brought before them, having the Good of the Nation
ever before their Eyes, and following in all things the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of their Conſcience; yet now the People of <hi>England</hi>
cannot expect a Remedy from a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> Legally
Called and Choſen. But they may perhaps ſee one Called,
in which all Elections will be carried by Fraud or Force, and
which will be compoſed of ſuch Perſons, of whom thoſe
evil Counſellors hold themſelves well aſſured, in which all
things will be carried on according to their Direction and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
without any regard to the Good or Happineſs of the
Nation. Which may appear evidently from this, That the
ſame Perſons tried the Members of the laſt Parliament, to
gain them to conſent to the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt and Penal
Laws,</hi> and procured that Parliament to be diſſolved, when
they found that they could not, neither by Promiſes nor
Threatnings, prevail with the Members to comply with
their wicked Deſign.</p>
                        <p>XIX. But, to Crown all, there are great and violent Preſumptions, inducing us to believe, that thoſe Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, in order to the carrying on their ill Deſigns, and to
the gaining to themſelves the more time for the effecting
of them, for the Encouragement of their Complices, and
for the diſcouraging of all good Subjects, have publiſh'd,
<hi>That the Queen hath brought forth a Son;</hi> tho' there have
appeared, both during the Queen's pretended Bigneſs, and
in the manner in which the Birth was managed, ſo many
juſt and viſible Grounds of Suſpicion, that not only we our
ſelves, but all the Good Subjects of this Kingdom, do vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
ſuſpect, <hi>That the pretended Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>was not
born by the Queen.</hi> And it was notoriouſly known to all the
World, that many both doubted of the Queen's Bigneſs,
and of the Birth of the Child, and yet there was not any
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:62930:148"/>
one thing done to ſatisfie them, or put an end to their
Doubts.</p>
                        <p>XX. And ſince Our deareſt and moſt entirely Beloved Conſort the Princeſs, and likewiſe We Our Selves, have ſo great an Intereſt in this Matter, and ſuch a Right as all the
World knows, to the Succeſſion to the Crown: Since all
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did in the Year 1672. when the States General
of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> were invaded with a moſt unjuſt
War, uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to put an end to that
War, and that in Oppoſition to thoſe who were then in the
Government; and by their ſo doing, they run the hazard of
loſing both the Favour of the Court, and their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
And ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation has ever teſtified a moſt
particular Affection and Eſteem, both to our deareſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
the Princeſs, and to Our ſelves, We cannot excuſe our
ſelves from eſpouſing their Intereſt, in a Matter of ſuch High
Conſequence: And for contributing all that lies in us, for
the maintaining both of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and of the
Laws and Liberties of thoſe Kingdoms, and for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to them the continual Enjoyment of all their juſt
Rights. To the doing of which, We are moſt earneſtly
ſollicited by a great many Lords, both Sipiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
and by many Gentlemen, and other Subjects of all
Ranks.</p>
                        <p>XXI. Therefore it is, That We have thought fit to go over to <hi>England,</hi> and to carry over with us a Force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſufficient, by the Bleſſing of God, to defend us from the Violence of
thoſe Evil Counſellors. And We, being deſirous that our
Intentions in this might be rightly underſtood, have for this
end prepared this Declaration; in which, as We have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
given a True Account of the Reaſons inducing us to
it; ſo we now think fit to declare, That this our Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is intended for no other Deſign, but to have a Free and
Lawful Parliament Aſſembled, as ſoon as it is poſſible; and
that, in order to this, all the late Charters by which the
Elections of Burgeſſes are limitted contrary to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Cuſtom, ſhall be conſidered as null, and of no
Force: And likewiſe all Magiſtrates who have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
turned out, ſhall forthwith reſume their former
Employments, as well as all the Boroughs of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall
return again to their Ancient Preſcriptions and Charters:
And more particularly, that the Ancient Charter of the
Great and Famous City of <hi>London,</hi> ſhall again be in Force:
And that the Writs for the Members of Parliament ſhall be
Addreſſed to the proper Officers, according to Law and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom:
That alſo none be ſuffered to chuſe, or to be choſen
Members of Parliament, but ſuch as are qualified by Law:
And that the Members of Parliament being thus choſen,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:62930:149"/>
they ſhall meet and ſit in full Freedom; that ſo the Two
Houſes may concur in the preparing ſuch Laws, as they
upon full and free Debate, ſhall judge neceſſary and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
both for the Confirming and Executing the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and ſuch others Laws as are neceſſary for
the Security and Maintenance of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi>
as likewiſe for making ſuch Laws as may Eſtabliſh a good
Agreement between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Diſſenters; as alſo for the Covering and Securing of
all ſuch who live peaceably under the Government, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
good Subjects, from all Perſecution upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Religion, even Papiſts themſelves not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
and for the doing of all other things, which the
Two Houſes of Parliament ſhall find neceſſary for the Peace,
Honour and Safety of the Nation, ſo that there may be no
more Danger of the Nation's falling at any time hereafter
under Arbitrary Government. To this Parliament we will
refer the Enquiry into the Birth of the pretended Prince of
<hi>Wales,</hi> and of all things relating to it, and to the Right of
Succeſſion,</p>
                        <p>XXII. And We, for our part, will concur in every thing that may procure the Peace and Happineſs of the Nation, which a Free and Lawful Parliament ſhal determine; ſince
we have nothing before our Eyes in this our Undertaking,
but the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of all Men from Perſecution for their Conſciences, and
the Securing the whole Nation the Free Enjoyment of all
their Laws, Rights, and Liberties, under a juſt and legal
Government.</p>
                        <p>XXIII. This is the Deſign that We have propoſed to our ſelves, in appearing upon this Occaſion in Arms, in the Conduct of which we will keep the Forces under our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
under all the Strictneſs of Martial Diſcipline, and
take ſpecial Care, That the People of the Countries,
through which we muſt march, ſhal not ſuffer by their
Means; and as ſoon as the State of the Nation will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of it, we promiſe, That we will ſend back all thoſe
Foreign Forces that we have brought along with us.</p>
                        <p>XXIV. We do therefore hope, That all People will judge rightly of us, and approve of theſe our Proceedings: But we chiefly rely on the Bleſſing of God for the Succeſs of
this our Undertaking, in which we place our whole and only
Confidence.</p>
                        <p>XXV. We do in the laſt place invite and require all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever, all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:62930:149"/>
this our Deſign againſt all ſuch as ſhall endeavour to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
us; that ſo we may prevent all thoſe Miſeries, which
muſt needs follow upon the Nations being kept under Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Government and Slavery: And that all the Violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Diſorders which have overturned the whole Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Engliſh Government, may be fully redreſſed in
a <hi>Free and Legal Parliament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XXVI. And we do likewiſe reſolve, That as ſoon as the Nation is brought to a ſtate of Quiet, we will take care that a Parliament ſhall be called in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for Reſtoring
the Ancient Conſtitution of that Kingdom, and for bringing
the Matters of Religion to ſuch a Settlement, that the People
may live eaſie and happy, and for putting an end to all the
unjuſt Violences, that have been in a Courſe of ſo many
Years committed there.</p>
                        <p>We will alſo ſtudy to bring the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſuch a State, that the Settlement there, may be Religiouſly obſerved; and that the Proteſtant and Britiſh Intereſt
there, may be ſecured. And we will endeavour, by all
poſſible means, to procure ſuch an Eſtabliſhment in all the
Three Kingdoms, that they may all live in a happy Union
and Correſpondence together; and that the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the Peace, Honour and Happineſs of thoſe
NATIONS, may be Eſtabliſhed upon Laſting Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>

                        <p>To this Declaration the Prince, upon further Information of things, thought fit to add another to this purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>AFter we had Prepared and Printed this Our Declaration, we have underſtood, that the Subverters of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Laws of theſe Kingdoms, hearing of our Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to aſſiſt the People againſt them, have began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
ſome of the Arbitrary and Deſpotick Power that they
had aſſumed, and to vacate ſome of their unjuſt Judgments
and Decrees. The Senſe of their Guilt, and the Diſtruſt
of their Force, have induced them to offer to the City of
<hi>London,</hi> ſome ſeeming Relief from their great Oppreſſions,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:62930:150"/>
hoping thereby to quiet the People, and to divert them from
demanding a Re-eſtabliſhment of their Religion and Laws,
under the ſhelter of our Arms: They do alſo give out, That
we do intend to Conquer and Enſlave the Nation; and
therefore it is, we have thought fit to add a few Words to
our Declaration.</p>
                        <p>VVe are confident, That no Perſons can have ſuch hard Thoughts of us, as to imagine we have any other Deſign in this our Undertaking, than to procure a Settlement of
the Religion, and of the Liberties and Properties of
the Subjects upon ſo ſure a Foundation, that there
may be no Danger of the Nation's Relapſing into the
like Miſeries at any time hereafter. And as the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we have brought along with us, are utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned
to that Wicked Deſign of Conquering
the Nation, if we were capable of intending it; ſo
the great Numbers of the Principal Nobility and Gentry
that are Men of Eminent Quality and Eſtates, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of known Integrity and Zeal, both for the Religion
and Government of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> many of them being
alſo diſtinguiſhed by their Conſtant Fidelity to the
Crown, who do both accompany us in this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and have earneſtly ſollicited us to it, will cover
us from all ſuch Malicious Inſinuations: For it is not
to be imagined, that either thoſe who have invited us,
or thoſe who are already come to aſſiſt us, can join in
a wicked Attempt of Conqueſt, to make void their
own Lawful Titles to their Honours, Eſtates and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</p>
                        <p>We are alſo confident, That all Men ſee how little Weight there is to be laid on all Promiſes and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can be now made; ſince there has been ſo
little regard had in the time paſt, to the moſt ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.
And as that imperfect Redreſs that is now offer'd,
is a plain Confeſſion of thoſe Violences of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that we have ſet forth; ſo the Defectiveneſs of it
is no leſs apparent: For they lay down nothing which
they may not take up at pleaſure; and they reſerve
entire, and not ſo much as mentioned, their Claims and
Pretences to an Arbitrary and Deſpotick Power, which
has been the Root of all their Oppreſſion, and of the
Total Subverſion of the Government. And it is plain,
That there can be no Redreſs, no Remedy offered but
in Parliament, by a Declaration of the Rights of the
Subjects that have been invaded, and not by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Acts of Grace, to which the Extremity of their
Affairs has driven them. Therefore it is that we have
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:62930:150"/>
thought fit to declare, That we will Refer all to a
Free Aſſembly of this NATION, in a Lawful Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>

that as We can add nothing to it, ſo We are ſure

            <p>This Letter was ſpread under-hand over the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and read by all ſorts of Men; and the Reaſon of it being undeniable, it had a great Force on the Spirits of the

Lord <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> where it arrived on Saturday the 17th of
<hi>November,</hi> and on the Monday following the KING entred
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> which was then the Head Quarters of the whole
Army. But on the 16th of the aforeſaid Month, the Lord
<hi>Delamere</hi> having received certain Intelligence of the Landing
of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
throng over in Arms, under pretence of Aſſiſting the King,
but, in reality, to enſlave us at Home, as they had already
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:62930:151"/>
reduced our Country-Men in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the loweſt Degree of
Danger and Impuiſſance that they have at any time been in
ſince the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> II.
He thereupon Aſſembled Fifty Horſe-Men, and at the Head of
them marched to <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> and the next Day he went to
<hi>Bodon-Downes,</hi> his Forces being then 150 ſtrong, declaring, his
Deſign was, To join with the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> This ſmall
Party of Men, by degrees, drew in all the North, and
could never be ſuppreſſed. Now before His Royal Highneſs
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> left <hi>Exeter,</hi> there was an <hi>Aſſociation</hi>
drawn up, and ſigned by all the Lords and Gentlemen that
were with him; the Date of which I cannot aſſign; but the
Words thereof are as follow.</p>
            <q>VVE whoſe Names are hereunto ſubſcribed, who have
now joined with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for the
Defence of the Proteſtant Religion, and for the maintaining
the Antient Government, and the Laws and Liberties of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> do engage to Almighty God, to His
Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and to one another, to ſtick firm
to this Cauſe, and to one another, in Defence of it; and never to
depart from it, until our Religion, Laws and Liberties are ſo far
ſecured to us, in a Free Parliament, that we ſhall be no more in
danger of falling into Popery and Slavery. And whereas we are
engaged in this Common Cauſe, under the Protection of the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> by which means his Perſon may be expoſed to Danger,
and to the curſed Attempts of Papiſts and other Bloody Men; we
do therefore ſolemnly engage to God and one another, that if any
ſuch Attempt be made upon him, we will purſue not only thoſe who
make it, but all their Adherents, and all that we find in Arms
againſt us, with the utmoſt Severity of a juſt Revenge, to their
Ruine and Deſtruction. And that the Execution of any ſuch
Attempt (which God, of his Infinite Mercy, forbid) ſhall not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
us from proſecuting this Cauſe which we do now undertake;
but that it ſhall engage us to carry it on with all the Rigour that
ſo barbarous a Practice ſhall deſerve.</q>
            <p>On the 20th of <hi>November</hi> there happened a Skirmiſh at <hi>Wincanton,</hi> between a Detachment of 70 Horſe and 50 Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons and Granadiers, commanded by Colonel <hi>Sarsfeild,</hi> and
about 30 of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Men, Commanded by one
<hi>Cambel;</hi> where, notwithſtanding the great Inequality of
Numbers, yet the latter fought with that deſperate Bravery,
that it ſtruck a Terrour into the Minds of the Army, who were

Action was every where magnified ſo much above the real
Truth, that it ſhewed clearly how much Men wiſhed the

according to the Free-born Liberties and Privileges

think it our Duty to declare to the reſt of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Fellow-Subjects, the Grounds of our preſent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
               <p>We are, by innumerable Grievances, made ſenſible, that the very Fundamentals of our Religion, Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties are about to be rooted out by our late Jeſuitical
Privy-Council; as has been of late too apparent, 1. By
the King's diſpenſing with all the Eſtabliſhed Laws at his
Pleaſure. 2. By diſplacing all Officers out of all Offices of
Truſt and Advantage, and placing others in their room,
that are known Papiſts deſervedly made incapable by the
Eſtabliſhed Laws of this Land. 3. By deſtroying the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of moſt Corporations in the Land. 4. By diſcouraging
all Perſons that are not Papiſts, and preferring ſuch as
turn to Popery. 5. By diſplacing all honeſt and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious
Judges, unleſs they would, contrary to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
declare that to be Law, which was merely arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
6. By branding all Men with the Name of <hi>Rebels,</hi> that
but offered to juſtifie the Laws, in a Legal Courſe, againſt
the Arbitrary Proceedings of the King, or any of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Miniſters. 7. By burthening the Nation with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to maintain the Violation of the Rights of the Subjects;
and by diſcountenancing the Eſtabliſhed Religion. 8. By
forbidding the Subjects the Benefit of Petitioning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing
them Libellers; ſo rendering the Laws a Noſe of
Wax, to ſerve their Arbitrary Ends. And many more ſuch
like, too long here to enumerate.</p>
               <p>We being thus made ſadly ſenſible of the Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government, that is by the Influence of Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Counſels coming upon us, do unanimouſly declare,
That not being willing to deliver our Poſterity over to ſuch
a Condition of Popery and Slavery, as the aforeſaid Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
do inevitably threaten; we will, to the utmoſt
of our power, oppoſe the ſame, by joining with the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> (whom, we hope, God Almighty hath ſent to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:62930:152"/>
reſcue us from the Oppreſſions aforeſaid;) and will uſe
our utmoſt Endeavours for the Recovery of our almoſt-ruined
Laws, Liberties and Religion: And herein we hope
all good Proteſtant Subjects will, with their Lives and
Fortunes, be aſſiſtant to us, and not be bugbear'd with the
opprobrious Terms of <hi>Rebels;</hi> by which they would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
us to become perfect Slaves to their Tyrannical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies
and Uſurpatations: For we aſſure our ſelves, that
no rational and unbyaſſed Perſon will judge it Rebellion to
defend our Laws and Religion, which all our Princes have,
at their Coronation, ſworn to do: Which Oath, how well
it hath been obſerved of late, we deſire a Free Parliament
may have the Conſideration of.</p>
               <p>We own it Rebellion to reſiſt a King that governs by Law: But he was always accounted a Tyrant, that made his Will the Law; and to reſiſt ſuch an one, we juſtly
eſteem no Rebellion, but a neceſſary Defence. And on
this Conſideration, we doubt not of all honeſt Mens Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
and humbly hope for, and implore the Great
GOD's Protection, who turneth the Hearts of His People
as pleaſeth Him beſt; it having been obſerved, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
can never be of one Mind without His Inſpiration:
Which hath in all Ages confirmed that Obſervation, <hi>Vox
Populi est Vox Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The preſent Reſtoring the Charters, and Reverſing the oppreſſing and unjuſt Judgment given on the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College, is plain, are but to ſtill the People, like
Plumbs to Children, by deceiving them for a while: But
if they ſhall by this Stratagem be fooled till this preſent
Storm that threatens the Papiſts be paſt, as ſoon as they
ſhall be re-ſettled, the former Oppreſſion will be put on
with greater Vigour. But we hope, <hi>In vain is the Net ſpread
in ſight of the Birds:</hi> For, the Papiſts old Rule is, that <hi>Faith
is not to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> as they term Proteſtants,
tho' the Popiſh Religion is the greateſt Hereſie. And
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſo ill obſerving her Promiſes to the <hi>Suffolk</hi>
Men, that helped her to her Throne. And, above all, the
Pope's diſpenſing with the Breach of Oaths, Treaties, or
Promiſes, at his pleaſure, when it makes for the Service of
Holy Church, as they term it. Theſe, we ſay, are ſuch
convincing Reaſons to hinder us from giving Credit to the
aforeſaid Mock-Shews of Redreſs, that we think our ſelves
bound in Conſcience to reſt on no Security that ſhall not
be approved by a Freely-elected Parliament: To whom,
under GOD, we refer our Cauſe.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In the mean time, the Nobility about the King having uſed all the Arguments they could invent, to perſuade him <pb n="288" facs="tcp:62930:153"/>

Heaven, as what I now do is free from Paſſion, Vanity, or Deſign,
with which Actions of this Nature are too often accompanied. I
am not ignorant of the frequent Miſchiefs wrought in the World

juſtifiable Cauſe, it would not be made the moſt ſpecious Pretence.
And your Majeſty has already ſhewn too intereſted a Senſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

I hope, never given the World cauſe to cenſure his real Conviction

my poor Services much over-paid) may not be ſufficient to incline
You to a charitable Interpretation of my Actions; yet, I hope, the
great Advantage I enjoy under Your Majeſty, which I can never
expect in any other Change of Government, may reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
Your Majeſty, and the World, that I am acted by an higher
Principle when I offer that Violence to my Inclination and Intereſt,
as to deſert Your Majeſty at a Time when Your Affairs ſeem to
challenge the ſtricteſt Obedience from all Your Subjects; much
more from one who lies under the greateſt Perſonal Obligations

to have no other End, than to prevail with the King to ſecure
their Religion, which they ſaw ſo much in danger by the violent

It was high time to put out this Order; for on Thurſday
<hi>Dec.</hi> 13. about Three in the Morning, there was a terrible
Allarm, That the Iriſh in a deſperate Rage, were approaching
<hi>London,</hi> putting Man, Woman and Child to the Sword,
which made the People all riſe, placing Lights in their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
from top to bottom, and every Man guarding his own
Door with his Muſquet charged with Powder and Ball; and all
the Traindbands of the City were in Arms; ſo that there was
nothing heard but Shooting and Beating of Drums all Night.
And, what is very ſtrange, this Allarm ſpread it ſelf over the
face of the whole Kingdom, and all that were able to carry
Arms vowed the Defence of their Lives, Laws, Religion and
Liberties, and ſtood reſolved to deſtroy all the Iriſh and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
in <hi>England,</hi> in caſe any Injury were offered them; but
few Papiſts ſuffered in their Perſons, only their Houſes were
generally rifled under a pretence of ſearching for Arms and
Ammunition.</p>
            <p>The Prince, who was now at <hi>VVindſor,</hi> had ſent M. <hi>Zuleſtein</hi>
to the King, to deſire him to continue at <hi>Rocheſter;</hi> but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him, the King came to <hi>VVhitehal,</hi> and from thence ſent
the Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> with a Letter to the Prince to <hi>VVindſor,</hi> to
invite him to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, with what number of Troops he
ſhould think convenient to bring along with him. But the
Prince referring the Conſideration of the Subject-Matter of
the Letter to the Peers about him, they concluded that the
ſhortneſs of the Time could admit of no better Expedient,
that the King might be deſired to remove with a reaſonable
Diſtance from <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>Ham,</hi> an Houſe belonging to the

            <p>He accordingly preſently introduced them, the King being by that time in Bed; where they made an Apology for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at ſo unſeaſonable a Time; and delivering him the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
the King read it, and ſaid, He would comply with it.
Upon this the Lords humbly deſired he would remove ſo early
as to be at <hi>Ham</hi> by Noon, to prevent Meeting the Prince in
his Way to <hi>London,</hi> where he was to come the ſame Day. His
Majeſty readily agreed to this too; and asked, whether he
might not appoint what Servants ſhould attend him: To
which the Lords replied, That it was left to him, to give
Order in that as he pleaſed; and ſo they took their Leave
of him. When they were gone as far as the Privy-Chamber,
the King ſent for them again, and told them, he had forgot to
acquaint them with his Reſolutions before the Meſſage came,
to ſend my Lord <hi>Godolphin</hi> next Morning to the Prince, to
propoſe his going back to <hi>Rocheſter;</hi> he finding, by the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
M. <hi>Zuleſtein</hi> was charged with, the Prince had no Mind
he ſhould be at <hi>London;</hi> and therefore he now deſired he
might rather return to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> than go to any other place.
The Lords replied, That they would immediately ſend an
Account to the Prince, of what His Majeſty deſired; and they
did not doubt of ſuch an Anſwer as would be to his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
Accordingly, they ſent to him, who was then at
<hi>Sion-Houſe;</hi> and before 8 next Morning there came a Letter
from M. <hi>Bentink,</hi> by the Prince's Order, agreeing to the
King's Propoſals of going to <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> Hereupon he went
(the Guards being made ready, and Boats prepared) that
Night to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> in his own Barge, attended by the Earl
of <hi>Arran,</hi> and ſome few others.</p>

The ſame Day, being <hi>Dec.</hi> 18. about Three in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> came to St. <hi>James</hi>'s,
attended by Monſieur <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and a great Number of the
Nobility and Gentry; and was entertained with a Joy and
Concourſe of the People which appeared free, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained;
and all the Bells in the City were rung, and Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires
made in every Street.</p>
            <p>The King continued at <hi>Rocheſter</hi> till <hi>Dec.</hi> 23. and then, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1 or 2 in the Morning, he privately withdrew himſelf; and taking only with him Mr. <hi>Ra. Sheldon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Delabady,</hi>
he went towards <hi>Dover,</hi> and embarked in a Veſſel laid ready
for his Tranſportation to <hi>France.</hi> The Queen, who went
hence the 10th, arrived at <hi>Calais</hi> on the 11th, and was in
great pain (not knowing what had happen'd in <hi>England</hi>)
for the King, whom ſhe expected every Tide. But the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<hi>Orange,</hi> by my Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and the Inſtructions I gave
him. But inſtead of an Anſwer, ſuch as I might have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for, what was I to expect, after the Uſage I received,
by the making the ſaid Earl a Priſoner, againſt the Practice
and Law of Nations; The ſending his own Guards at 11
at Night, to take Poſſeſſion of the Poſts at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
advertiſing me in the leaſt manner of it; The ſending
to me at One of the Clock at Mid-night, when I was in
Bed, a kind of Order, by three Lords, to be gone out of
my Palace before Twelve the ſame Morning? After all this,
How could I hope to be ſafe, ſo long as I was in the Power
of one who had not only done this to me, and invaded my
Kingdoms, without any juſt Occaſion given him for it; but
that did, by his own Declaration, lay the greateſt Aſperſion
on me that Malice could invent, in that Clauſe of it which
concerns my Son? I appeal to all that know me, nay, even
to himſelf, that, in their Conſciences, neither he, nor they,
can believe me in the leaſt capable of ſo unnatural a Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
nor of ſo little common Senſe, to be impoſed on in a
Thing of ſuch a Nature as that. What had I then to expect
from one, who, by all Arts, hath taken ſuch pains to make
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:62930:161"/>
me appear as <hi>Black as Hell</hi> to my own People, as well as
to all the World beſides? What Effect that hath had at
home, all Mankind hath ſeen, by ſo general a Defection
in my Army, as well as in the Nation, amongſt all ſorts of
People.</p>
                     <p>I was born free, and deſire to continue ſo: And tho' I have ventured my Life very frankly, on ſeveral Occaſions, for the Good and Honour of my Country, and am as free
to do it again, (and, which I hope I ſhall yet do, as old as
I am, to redeem it from the Slavery it is like to fall under;)
yet I think it not convenient to expoſe my ſelf to be ſo
ſecured, as not to be at liberty to effect it; and for that
Reaſon to withdraw, but ſo as to be within Call whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Nation's Eyes ſhall be opened, ſo as to ſee how
they have been impoſed upon by the ſpecious Pretences of
<hi>Liberty and Property.</hi> I hope it will pleaſe GOD to touch
their Hearts, out of his infinite Mercy, and to make them
ſenſible of the ill Condition they are in, and bring them to
ſuch a Temper, that a Legal Parliament may be called; and
that, amongſt other things which may be neceſſary to be
done, they will agree to <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> for all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant-Diſſenters;
and that thoſe of my own Perſuaſion may
be ſo far conſidered, and have ſuch a Share of it, as they
may live peaceably and quietly, as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ought to do, and not be obliged to tranſplant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
which would be very grievous, eſpecially to ſuch
who love their Country. And I appeal to all Men, who are
conſidering Men, and have had Experience, whether any
thing can make this Nation ſo great and flouriſhing as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conſcience: Some of our Neighbours dread it.</p>

                  <p>I Have endeavoured to the utmoſt of my Power, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what was deſired from me in order to the Publick Peace and Safety; and I do not know that any thing hath
been omitted which might tend to the preſervation of
them, ſince the Adminiſtration of Affairs was put into my
Hands. It now lieth upon you to lay the Foundations of
a firm ſecurity for your Religion, your Laws, and your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
                  <p>I do not doubt, but that by ſuch a full and free Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Nation, as is now met, the Ends of my <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>

            <p>Their firſt Act was an Addreſs of Thanks to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for what he had ſucceſsfully undertaken for the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a deſire he ſhould continue the Adminiſtration of Publick
Affairs, and take particular Care of the Affairs of <hi>Ireland;</hi>
with a promiſe on their part to diſpatch the Affairs that lay
under their Conſideration with utmoſt Application; to which
having received a very kind Anſwer on the Prince his part,
both Houſes immediately fell to their Work, and after 8 days
the Commons paſt the following Vote.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolv'd,</hi> That King <hi>James II.</hi> having endeavour'd to ſubvert the Conſtitution of this Kingdom, by breaking the Original Contract between King and People, and by the Advice of Jeſuits, and other
wicked Perſons, having violated the <hi>Fundamental Laws,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
withdrawn himſelf out of this Kingdom, hath <hi>abdicated</hi> the
Government, and that the Throne is thereby vacant.</p>
            <p>The Declaration of the Commons being ſent up to the Lords for their Concurrence, that Houſe entered into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate upon it, and ſo far agreed with it, that they had only by
way of amendment put in the word <hi>Deſerted</hi> inſtead of <hi>Abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:62930:162"/>
and left out <hi>and that the Throne is thereby vacant,</hi> and
ſent a Meſſage to the Commons to acquaint them therewith:
But they were ſo far from approving of what the Lords had
done, that they proceeded to give their Reaſons againſt the
Amendment, alledging that they could not allow the word <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted</hi>
inſtead of <hi>Abdicated</hi> (which their Houſe had made
choice of) becauſe it did not fully expreſs the Concluſion
neceſſarily inferred from the Premiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> That K. <hi>James</hi> II.
had endeavoured to ſubvert the Conſtitutions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as before in the former part of the Declaration, to
which their Lordſhips had agreed, ſeeing <hi>Deſerted</hi> only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
withdrawing, whereas <hi>Abdicated</hi> did reſpect the
whole. Neither were the Commons better pleaſed with the
Lords for leaving out the laſt words, <hi>And that the Throne is
thereby vacant,</hi> and the Commons did ſo much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon it, becauſe that if they ſhould admit of the Lord's
Amedment, that <hi>the King had only deſerted the Government,</hi> yet
even thence it would follow that the Throne was vacant as to
King <hi>James</hi> II. deſerting the Government, being in true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
deſerting the Throne. Beſides, the Commons did
conceive there was no neceſſity to prove to their Lordſhips,
or any other, that the Throne was vacant, ſince the Lords
themſelves both before and after their meeting in the ſaid
Convention, had addreſt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to take upon
him the Adminiſtration of Publick Affairs, both Civil and
Military, and had appointed a Day of publick Thankſgiving
to be obſerved throughout the Kingdom; by all which the
Commons underſtood, it was their Lordſhips Opinion, that
the Throne was vacant, and that they ſignified ſo much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to the People of <hi>England:</hi> To which they added, that it
was from thoſe who were upon the Throne of <hi>England,</hi>
where there was any fault, that the People of <hi>England</hi> ought
to receive Protection, and to whom for that Cauſe, they owed
the Allegiance of Subjects, but there being none then from
whom they expected Regal Protection, and to whom for
that cauſe they owed the Allegiance of Subjects, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
conceived the Throne vacant. The Iſſue of theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
was a Conference held on <hi>Feb.</hi> 5. between the two
Houſes, who appointed Managers accordingly. The Lords
inſiſted hard upon their Amendments, and ſome of them run
ſo far upon the Debate, that they did in a manner ſeem to
recede from the Premiſes which their Houſe had allowed of,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>King had endeavoured to ſubvert the Conſtitutions
of the Kingdom,</hi> as before; but the Commons ſtood ſtoutly
to their Declaration, and to the forementioned Reaſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a great many fine things to back the Argument, which
'twere pity to curtail any way, and I have not room to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the whole, but in concluſion the Conference ended in
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62930:163"/>
appearance with leſs likelihood of Agreement than when it
firſt began. Yet though there was ſome further ſtruggle
made in the upper Houſe for the Intereſt of the late King, at
length it was by Majority of Voices, <hi>Feb</hi> 7th, agreed to by
the Lords to ſend a Meſſage to the Commons that they had
agreed to the Vote ſent them up <hi>Jan.</hi> 25th, touching which
they had had a free Conference the Day before, without any
alteration, So that the next thing that came under Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
was the form of Government to be eſtabliſh'd. I
do not remember that a Commonwealth was mentioned to
be ſet up at all in either Houſe, though Father <hi>Orleans</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſay ſo in his Hiſtory of the Revolutions of <hi>England;</hi>
the two main things then to be conſidered was, whether to
ſet up a Regency; or to continue a Regal Dignity in a new
Subject: But the former of the two being well known to be
attended with many publick Evils, it was at laſt concluded
for the latter, and that in Favour of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
our Deliverer, and her Royal Princeſs who was immediate
Heireſs. In purſuance of this, a Declaration was drawn up,
in order to ſuch an Eſtabliſhment, as that the Religion, Laws
and Liberties of the Kingdom might not again be in danger,
and for vindicating and aſſerting the Ancient Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the People, in theſe Words.</p>

If your Majeſty had rather given credit to the friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances
that were made you, by our late Envoy the Count <hi>De

of the Peace, of which, by the Treaty at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> you
are made the Guarantee, and to that end entred into Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with us, and ſuch others as have the like just Sentiments
in this matter, we are verily perſwaded that by theſe means you

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:62930:168"/>
who were ſo much exaſperated through their averſion to our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the publick Peace had been as well preſerved in your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
as here in the Roman Empire: but now we refer it even to
your Majeſty, to judge what condition we can be in to afford you
any aſſiſtance, who being not only engaged in a War with the <hi>Turks,</hi>
but finding our ſelves at the ſame time unjuſtly and barbarouſly
attack'd by the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to, and against the Faith of
Treaties, they then knowing themſelves ſecure of <hi>England;</hi> and
this ought not to be concealed, that the greatest Injuries which
have been done to our Religion, have flowed from no other than
from the <hi>French</hi> themſelves; who not only eſteem'd it lawful for
them to make perfidious Vows with the ſworn Enemies of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Croſs, tending to the Deſtruction both of us and the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World, in order to the checking our endeavours which were
undertaken for the Glory of God, and to ſtop thoſe Succeſſes which
it hath pleaſed the Almighty God to give us hitherto, but further
have heaped one Treachery upon another even within the Empire
it ſelf: The Cities of the Empire which were ſurrendred, upon
Articles ſigned by the <hi>Dauphin</hi> himſelf, have been exhauſted by
exceſſive Impoſitions: and after their being exhauſted have been
plundered, after plundering have been burned and raced; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
of Princes, who in all times, and even in the most deſtructive
Wars, have been preſerved, are now burnt to the ground, the
Churches are robb'd, and ſuch as ſubmitted themſelves to them are
in a most barbarous manner carried away as Slaves: In ſhort, it
is become a Diverſion unto them to commit all manner of Inſolence
and Cruelty in many places, but chiefly in Catholick Countries,
exceeding the Cruelties of the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves, who having impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
an abſolute neceſſity upon us to ſecure our ſelves and the holy
Roman Empire by the best means we can think on, and that no
leſs against them than against the <hi>Turks,</hi> we promiſe our ſelves
from your Juſtice readily to aſſent to this, that it ought not to be
imputed to us if we endeavour to procure by a just War that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to our ſelves which we could not hitherto obtain by ſo many
Treaties, and that in order to the obtaining thereof we take mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
for our mutual Defence of Preſervation, with all thoſe who
are equally concerned in the ſame Deſign with us. It remains that
we ſhould beg of God that he would direct all things to his Glory,
and that he would grant your Majeſty true and ſolid Comforts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this your great Calamity. We embrace you with the tender

It would be too tedious to enter upon the Particulars of
the Siege of <hi>Derry,</hi> and how much they baffled the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army
almoſt in all their Encounters with them. I ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that Major <hi>Baker</hi> whom they choſe Governour, after
Colonel <hi>Lundy</hi> had play'd the Rogue and was turn'd out, and
Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> the Miniſter who was entruſted with the Stores,
behaved themſelves beyond expectation, and ſo did Colonel
<hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> who ſucceeded Governour after <hi>Baker</hi>'s Death,
and will with the reſt of their brave Officers and Soldiers, be
for ever remembred by all true Engliſhmen with the greateſt
deference and reſpect, as they themſelves will have occaſion
while they live, with indignation to think of <hi>Lundy</hi>'s baſeneſs
in preventing the Relief ſent them of two Regiments under
Colonel <hi>Richards</hi> and Colonel <hi>Gunningham,</hi> who returned back
out of the Lough of <hi>Derry</hi> without doing any thing, and were
both broke for their pains. Yet for all this misfortune, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a formidable Enemy without, nor a more terrible one
that had crept within their Walls, <hi>viz.</hi> Famine, which daily
ſwept away multitudes of the Gariſon, could bring them to
yield; but they outbraved all till the long-delay'd Succors at
laſt, under the Command of Major-General <hi>Kirk,</hi> arrived in
the Lough. But alas! they were now in worſe plight than
before; for, like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> they had the ſight of the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Fruit, but could not reach to eat: for whether through
the croſſneſs of the Winds, as was given out, or for ſome
other baſe ends, the Ships lay at leaſt two Months in the
Lough, before the <hi>Dartmouth</hi> Frigat at laſt forced her way,
and got to the Town, which was followed with the raiſing of
the Siege, which happened on <hi>July</hi> 31th. This was no ſmall
mortification to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who met with as bad Succeſs in
another Enterpriſe of theirs againſt the <hi>Iniskillingers;</hi> For,
but the day before, about 6000 of them being upon their
March,<note place="margin">The <hi>Iriſh</hi> routed by the <hi>Iniskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingers,</hi> and <hi>Mackarty</hi> made a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</note> under the Command of Major-General <hi>Mackarty,</hi> an
experienced Officer among them, the <hi>Iniskillingers</hi> advanced
near 20 miles to meet them, and at a place called <hi>Newton
Butler</hi> fought and routed them, took <hi>Mackarty</hi> Priſoner, and
kill'd and drowned nigh 3000 of them, though themſelves
were not above 2000 in all, and loſt not above 20 Men, with
about 50 wounded.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were doing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the King gave out Commiſſions in <hi>England,</hi> for raiſing 18 Regiments of Foot and 5 of Horſe, for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Service, with that Succeſs, that
the Levies were almoſt all compleat in 6 weeks, and in <hi>July</hi>
moſt of them were commanded for <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in order to be
ſhipped off for <hi>Ireland.</hi> On <hi>Thurſday, August</hi> 8th, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
10000 Men, Horſe and Foot, and Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> for

were about 90 Veſſels in all, of all ſorts, and were under fail

<hi>Lisburn,</hi> and ſo onwards through <hi>Hilsborough,</hi> and encamped
at <hi>Drummore,</hi> where <hi>Hamilton</hi> had routed the Northern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
The day following they continued their March to
<hi>Lougbbrilane,</hi> where the <hi>Iniskilling</hi> Horſe and Dragoons joined,
and were ordered to be an Advance Guard to the Army. But
before they could reach <hi>Newry,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troops had deſerted
and burnt it: yet the General finding an old ſquare Tower
in it left ſtanding, he garriſon'd it with 50 Men, and from
hence they advanced to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and encamp'd about a mile
North of the Town, in a low moiſt ground, having the Town
and the River towards the W. between them and the Enemy,
the Sea towards the S. the <hi>Newry</hi> Mountains to the E. and
to the N. Hills and Bogs intermixt. The bad Weather, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Marches, and ſcarcity of Proviſions, made our Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
begin to faint, but here they met with ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Mutton, and were on the 8th joined by Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Kirk</hi>'s; Sir <hi>John Hanmor</hi>'s and Brigadier <hi>Stuart</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
But the Fleet, with the Train, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> failing to come
up to <hi>Carlingford-Bay</hi> (as directed) was a great Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as Diſappointment to them for ſeveral days;
and ſo much the more, that the General had intelligence by
an Engineer that deſerted the Enemy, that their Army, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of about 20000 Men, was at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> but 16 Miles
from <hi>Dundalk,</hi> where the Duke halted; and whereof when
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:62930:172"/>
the General <hi>de Roſne</hi> heard, he ſaid he was ſure the Duke
wanted ſomething, and therefore adviſed them to make what
haſte they could to get their Forces in a readineſs, ſome part
of which in a day or 2 after moved towards <hi>Ardee,</hi> a ſmall
Town between <hi>Drogheda</hi> and <hi>Dundalk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They continued ſomewhat in an uncertain Poſture till the 20th, when in the morning the General had an Account that the Enemy advanced towards him, and that a Party of 2000
Foot and 1500 Horſe were gone beyond the Mountains, to
attack the Paſs at <hi>Newry,</hi> and fall into their Rear; but tho'
a Party of the Enemies Horſe appear'd in the ſight of their
Camp, and that they had ſeveral Battalions of Foot drawn up
in order near to theirs, yet they retired upon the advancing
of a Party of Horſe againſt them; and the other Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hearing my Lord <hi>Hewet</hi>'s Horſe and Sir <hi>Henry Inglesby</hi>'s
Foot were marching to the Camp, and then in <hi>Newry,</hi> they
wheeled off towards <hi>Sligo.</hi> But the day following the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
diſplay'd their Standard Royal, and all drew out both
Horſe and Foot, having along with them a very handſome
Train of Artillery, and a great Body of their Horſe advanced
towards our Armies Out-works. Several of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
were for fighting, and would have the Duke ſend for the
Horſe home that were a forraging; but his Anſwer was, <hi>Let
them alone, we will ſee what they will do;</hi> and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he ſaw them advance within Cannon-ſhot of his Trenches,
yet he ſaid ſtill, he ſaw no ſign of their deſigning to fight;
only once, when he ſaw them draw their Army into two
Lines, he ſent Lieutenant-General <hi>Douglas</hi> to the Camp, to
order all the Foot to ſtand to their Arms, and ſent to the
Horſe, that upon firing 3 Pieces of Cannon, they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Camp, but till then go on with their foraging,
and in the mean time alighted off of his Horſe, and ſat him
down on a little Hill, ſeeming as if he ſleeped, but no doubt
his Thoughts were wakeful enough, and buſie about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Poſture of his Affairs. <hi>Douglas</hi> had no ſooner given the
Orders, but the Soldiers with the greateſt chearfulneſs in
the world ſtood to their Arms, and ſeveral that had not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of their Tents for a week together now readily han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
their Muskets, being glad to think they had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to beat the Enemy (for they never ſuppoſed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe)
and ſo to march towards them from that ſad place,
which was already very uneaſie to them; but in ſome time
the Enemy drew off, and ſo the matter ended much to the
diſſatisfaction of the Engliſh Soldiers.</p>
            <p>In a day or two after this,<note place="margin">A Conſpiracy diſcovered among the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army.</note> there was a dangerous Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy diſcovered among ſome of the French Regiments, and firſt 4 Soldiers, and a Drummer, then 16 more were apprehended,

               </note> becauſe of their Strength and Numbers, it was not ſo
with the <hi>Iniskilliners;</hi> for on <hi>Friday</hi> the 27th came News into
the Camp, that Colonel <hi>Lloyd</hi> with about 1000 <hi>Iniskillingers,</hi>
had defeated a Body of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that were marching towards
<hi>Sligo,</hi> conſiſting of about 5000 Men, killing 700 of them,
and taking <hi>O Kelly</hi> their Commander, and 40 other Officers
Priſoners, beſides a great Booty of 8000 head of Cattle,
with the inconſiderable loſs of 14 Men. With this News
the General was ſo taken, that he ordered all the <hi>Iniskillin</hi>
Horſe and Foot in the Camp to draw out, and complemented
them, ſo far as to ride all along their Line with his Hat off;
then ordered the <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards and the <hi>Iniskillin</hi> Foot to
draw into a Line, to the Right of the Works at the Weſt-End
of the Town, where they made 3 running Firings, which
were anſwered by the <hi>Iniskillin</hi> Horſe from their Camp, and by
the great Guns upon the Works, as alſo from the Ships that
lay at the Mouth of the River.</p>
            <p>But this ſucceſs was ſome time after much abated by the loſs of <hi>Sligo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Iriſh</hi> take <hi>Sligo.</hi>

But for all this a <hi>French</hi> Captain with a detach'd Party of

ſome Proviſion, and finding 3 Barrels of Powder in the Fort,

killed the Engineer and 2 or 3 more, the reſt retired, and
he burnt the Engine; Day no ſooner appeared, but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

it upon honourable Terms; and at their marching over the

profered every Man that would ſerve the late King, Horſe and
Arms with 5 Guinea's advance; yet they all made anſwer,
<hi>They would never fight for Papiſts,</hi> exept one, who the very

we were unwilling to take any notice hitherto, that they
might not interfere with the more immediate Affairs of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
whereof we have now given you the relation.</p>
            <p>The Confederate Army this Year in <hi>Flanders</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Prince <hi>Waldeck,</hi> as that of <hi>France</hi> was by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>de Humieres,</hi> between whom there paſſed very little
of moment, till about the middle of <hi>Aug.</hi> when the Prince
decamping from <hi>Fountain Eveque</hi> paſſed the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and fell
into the Enemies Country; and having taken up his Camp
at <hi>Thit-Chateau,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> encamped ſo near him, that the
Out-guards were not above half an hours march from one
another. The Mareſchal on the 25th hearing that a great
number of <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe were out a foraging, attempted to
ſurprize them; to which end he made a motion with his
whole Army, which ſome days before had been reinforced
with 6000 Men. The Prince had no ſooner notice hereof, but
he fired ſome Pieces of Cannon to give his Foragers notice,
as had been agreed upon before: However<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their being vigorouſly charged by the <hi>French,</hi> who took

Village of <hi>Forge,</hi> where 800 Foot were poſted to ſecure the
Foragers, being commanded by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonel <hi>Hodges,</hi>
Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Goes,</hi> and the Major of the Regiment of
<hi>Heſſe,</hi> who for above two hours defended themſelves gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

Major General of the Cavalry, who was ſent to bring back the
Lieutenant Generals <hi>Webbenum, Marleborough,</hi> and <hi>d' Hubi,</hi>
come with their Horſe timely to their ſuccour. With that
reinforcement they made a retreating Fight againſt the main
of the whole <hi>French</hi> Army, that came pouring in upon them,
till they came to a riſing Ground near <hi>Walcourt,</hi> where they
joined a Battalion of <hi>Lunemburgers,</hi> which had been reinforced
by another of Colonel <hi>Hales.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> attack'd the Town
with great reſolution, which laſted an hour and an half; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> ordered Lieutenant General
<hi>Alva,</hi> to march with 3 Regiments to their relief, the ſame
being alſo followed by the Guards of the Body, and 2 <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Regiments commanded by the Lord of <hi>Marleborough;</hi>
while Major General <hi>Slaugeburg</hi> advanced almoſt at the ſame
time with ſome other Regiments of Foot to the other ſide
of the Town; all which Motions when the <hi>French</hi> perceived,
they retreated in great haſte, and ſome diſorder, leaving
ſome Cannon and Ammunition with many Men ſlain behind
them; but they could not be purſued becauſe of the hillineſs
of the Ground, which without doubt hindred their coming
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:62930:174"/>
to a general Battel, and which, in all probability, would not
have been to the Advantage of the <hi>French,</hi> ſince the <hi>Dutch</hi>
and other Forces were never more eager to have fought it
out than at that time. However, they kept their Poſt all
that night, as a token of their Victory: It was ſaid, the
<hi>French</hi> had near 2000 killed and wounded in this Encounter,
though they would never acknowledge near ſo many, among
whom were reckoned a good many Officers: The greateſt loſs
on the Confederates ſide were ſome of the Foragers killed,
and more taken Priſoners in the firſt Action, ſo that the
number of the ſlain did not amount to above 300, (but this
was minced) of which the chiefeſt were Lieutenant-Colonel
<hi>Grimes</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Major of the Dragoons of <hi>Zell</hi>
one Captain, and ſome inferiour Officers. And thus ended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this Campaign in <hi>Flanders,</hi> without any other memorable
Action, ſaving that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> demoliſhed a great part of
the <hi>French</hi> Lines, and raiſed conſiderable Contributions in
the <hi>French</hi> Territories, whilſt they acted in a ſeparate Body
from the main Army towards <hi>Courtray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the <hi>German</hi> ſide the Armies were both early in the Field, and quickly enter'd upon Action; and the firſt place that felt the Effects of the Confederate Arms was <hi>Keyſerwaert,</hi>
a Town in the Dutchy of <hi>Cleve,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

means: However, they gave the Gariſon warning, that if
they capitulated not before the 25th of the Month, they
ſhould have no quarter, with which Menaces ſeeming not
to be much frightned, the Confederates having at length all
their Bombs and Artillery ready, began to batter the place in
good earneſt, and Monſieur <hi>du Puy</hi> a Refugee Engineer, and
the ſame that had made the laſt Fortifications of <hi>Sedan,</hi> had

with the Subjects of the Empire, except the <hi>Liegois,</hi>
who ſhould retire or ſtay in the Regiment as they thought
fit, and that the Elector in his own as well as the reſt of the
Confederates Names, ſhould be obliged to the obſervation
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:62930:174"/>
of all the Capitulation, on condition that the <hi>French</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Town, and any Sum of the King's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
exceeding 5000 Crowns that was found there, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

of theſe Articles, there marched out of the Town 38
Horſe, 30 Dragoons, and 4000 Foot, the Confederates all
the while ſtanding to their Arms in Battel-array; there came
out 400 <hi>Germans,</hi> that took an Oath of Fidelity to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
who found 58 Pieces of Cannon, 2 Mortars with Stores
proportionable, in the place, and of which he made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Schoning</hi> Governour. And that every thing at this time
might appear to concur for the cementing of the <hi>Germans</hi>
among themſelves, the accommodation between the King of

the 30th of <hi>June,</hi> and Couriers diſpatch'd ſeveral ways to

            <p>Theſe things being thus ſucceſsfully, though ſlowly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, there was a Siege of greater importance now in view,<note place="margin">

of the Reduction of it by the <hi>German</hi> Army, under the
Command of the ever renowned and famous Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
who in the Month of <hi>June</hi> arrived at <hi>Frankford,</hi> with
20000 old Soldiers with him accuſtomed to Victory, and there
held a Council of War in conjunction with the Elector of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xony,</hi>
and other confederate Commanders, where it was then
whiſpered the Siege of <hi>Mentz</hi> had been reſolved on: But
however it was, the place was not inveſted till <hi>July</hi> 17. and
the Trenches not opened till the 22d, the Army as well
conſiſting of Imperialiſts, as <hi>Saxons, Heſſians,</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi>
(which laſt, after they had left a conſiderable Force in the
black Foreſt, marched 10000 ſtrong to the Siege) being 50000
and upwards. It will be too tedious to enter upon every
particular days Action, and advance in the Siege, but in the
general it was thus: The frequent Sallies of the Beſieged, in
a little time ruined all the Works which the Beſiegers had
been raiſing for ſeveral days, and that was the reaſon that
it was ſo long before the Batteries could be in a condition to
make Breaches in the Walls, and the Works of the City:
On the 16th of <hi>Aug.</hi> the Beſieged made a Sally at high noon,
to the number of 2000, upon the <hi>Saxon</hi>'s Quarters, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
overturned all before them; but the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to their Relief, there happened a moſt terrible ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on both ſides, the <hi>French</hi> loſing at leaſt 500 Men, but the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:62930:175"/>
Confederates a great many more. Some few days after, they
made three Sallies on one and the ſame day, and within two
hours of one another; in the two firſt whereof, they made
great ſlaughter among the Beſiegers, and cleared the Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
the third was made with 3000 Men, Drums beating, and
Colours flying: now in regard the Beſiegers did not expect
this third Effort, they were ſomewhat ſurprized, and the
<hi>French</hi> at firſt killed near 600 of them, nail'd 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Horſe in a place where the Beſiegers had begun to open
their Trenches; but at laſt the Imperialiſts having rallied,
vigorouſly repulſed the Enemy, who loſt a world of Men in
the Action.</p>
            <p>But for all this great Reſiſtance, the Beſiegers, by little and little, made themſelves Maſters of all the Out-poſts, where the Enemy had planted themſelves, and raiſed Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries

Bombs. It's incredible what a noiſe and a havock all this
made together; while the Cannon opened a Breach, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
advanced towards the Counterſcarp, blew up ſome
Mines, and made all things ready for a general Aſſault. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the 5th of <hi>Sept.</hi> a Council of War was held, and the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
being reſolved on the next day in 3 ſeveral Quarters,
every thing was ſet to rights with all the care that an Affair
of ſo great moment required; and accordingly on the 6th,
by break of day, the Cannon began to play upon the City
from the Batteries, and continued doing ſo till 4 in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon.
Then upon the throwing up of a Bomb, which
was the Signal agreed on, the Aſſault began on the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Quarter, at what time the <hi>Imperialiſts, Heſſians,</hi> and <hi>Lunem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers</hi>
followed; and having fought for 3 hours like Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
they made themſelves Maſters of the Counterſcarp;
while the <hi>French,</hi> who all this while fired very thick with
their Cannon, killed a great number of the Beſiegers, and
ſprung at the ſame time 3 Mines, that buried ſeveral of the
<hi>Heſſians.</hi> On the other ſide, the Imperialiſts lodged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the number of 11000 Foot, and 3000 Horſe upon
the Bulwark, called <hi>Boniface,</hi> notwithſtanding the Fire and
Smoak of their Bombs and Cannons, the <hi>Lunenburgers</hi> and
<hi>Saxans</hi> fell on alſo with no leſs fury, and purſued the Enemy
to the very Gates of the City, killing all before them, and
ſparing no body. But now the Beſieged finding all the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
loſt, wherein the ſtrength of the Place conſiſted, their
own number much abated, and the Beſiegers beginning to
fill up the Moat in order to ſtorm the Body of the Town,
they beat a Parley, and deſired to capitulate; and when all
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:62930:175"/>
things were agreed on, they marched out on the 11th of <hi>Sept.</hi>
in the Forenoon, with Drums beating, Colours flying, 6 pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Cannon and 2 Mortars, upon condition they would
leave behind them in the Town,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mentz</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> all the Contributions which
they had gathered from the Inhabitants, and adjacent parts.
The number of the Gariſon was found to be extreamly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with this ſevere Siege; but though there was an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
neceſſity for the <hi>Germans</hi> to recover this City out of
the <hi>French</hi> hands, yet the winning of it coſt them very dear,
ſome accounts reckoning their Loſs to have been no leſs than
20000 Men, and among them ſeveral conſiderable Officers.</p>
            <p>But this Account is by much too large, and therefore the more modeſt Computation has been, that the <hi>Imperialists</hi>
loſt upwards of 6000 Men before the place, amongſt which
are reckoned 4 Princes, and that the <hi>French</hi> Loſs was very
near 5000, beſides wounded, not above 6000 marching out
the Town; whereas it is known the Gariſon was about 11000
before the Siege: but the Marqueſs <hi>d'Vxelles</hi> being unwilling
to acknowledge the Victory was owing to the Courage and
Gallantry of the <hi>Germans,</hi> gave out, that it was want of
Powder made him ſurrender.</p>
            <p>While the Confederates were engaged in the Siege of <hi>Mentz,</hi>
the <hi>French,</hi> who had before laid the Cities of <hi>Spire, Oppenheim,
Keidiſcum,</hi> and <hi>Worms,</hi> in aſhes, and ſoon after <hi>Frankendall,</hi>
were not now idle, but continued their Diſorders in the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate,
burning and ſacking all along the Towns and Villages,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> burning and ravaging the Palatinate.</note>
from <hi>Heidelberg</hi> to <hi>Frankfort.</hi> They had reſolved to begin
with the Capital of the Palatinate, and to that end the
Mareſchal <hi>de Duras</hi> drew near it <hi>Aug.</hi> 4th with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Body, and the City had been infallibly carried (for there
were then but 500 Men in Garriſon within it) if they had
not met by chance with 1000 Men of the Regiment of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg,</hi>
that were on their March to <hi>Benſheim;</hi> on the 5th
the <hi>French</hi> fired very thick with their Cannon, from a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt
called the <hi>Star,</hi> which had been demoliſhed, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
themſelves alſo of an Hill that lay behind the Caſtle,
with a Deſign to cut off 1000 Men that were coming to the
Relief of the place; but they found a way to paſs the <hi>Neckar,</hi>
and ſo got into the City. On the 6th they attempted to
ſtorm the place, but with ſo ill ſucceſs, that they loſt 400
Men, and then they retreated towards <hi>Phillipsburg:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they ſome time after attack'd <hi>Bruſchall,</hi> and after ſome
Aſſaults carried it. But this Acquiſition was nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of the Loſs of <hi>Mentz,</hi> the Conſequences whereof
they dreaded; and therefore they were no ſooner informed
of the Surrender of it, but they laid all the Country waſte
about <hi>Mont-Royal,</hi> as believing the Confederates would ſit
down next before that place. They were not alſo without
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:62930:176"/>
ſome Apprehenſions of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> it ſelf being in danger, by
their burning St. <hi>Villa Marche, Baboigne, Salme, la Roch,
Darbi,</hi> and ſome other Villages in that <hi>Dutchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> had no ſooner made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Keyſerwaert,</hi> than that he bent his Thoughts upon the Siege of <hi>Bonne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonne</hi> beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi>
               </note> But there happened ſeveral things that
occaſioned the retarding of the Execution of it with any
great Vigour, though he actually inveſted it: For the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>de Bouflers</hi> having drawn a conſiderable body of Men
together, fell with Fire and Sword into the Electorate of
<hi>Treves,</hi> harraſing and burning all before him, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that at <hi>Cocheim</hi> a ſmall Town upon the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> about
5 Leagues from <hi>Mont-Royal,</hi> there lay about 1600 Men, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and partly Inhabitants of <hi>Treves,</hi> he reſolved
to force the place; and to that purpoſe, <hi>July</hi> 25. he march'd
thither with all his Force, and having firſt ſummoned the
Gariſon to ſurrender at diſcretion, but they inſiſting upon
honourable Conditions, he attacked them next morning in
3 ſeveral places: But the Imperialiſts repulſed them ſeveral
times, and then reſolved to abandon the Caſtle, which had
been ruined the preceding Winter, and to retire into the
Town, which they thought was more tenable; which being
perceived by the Enemy who had attack'd them on that ſide,
they charged them ſo vigorouſly, that they entred the Town
pell-mell with them at the ſame time, and drove all the
Beſieged before them, to the great place, where they made
a ſtand: But being by much overpowered with Numbers,
they were in the firſt heat of the <hi>French</hi> fury, Man, Woman,
and Child, put to the Sword. At laſt their military Rage
being ſomewhat abated, they made about 300 of them Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
of War, yet the <hi>French</hi> did not come off without
conſiderable loſs on their ſide alſo. This News was no ſooner
carried to the Elector, but he diſpatch'd away <hi>Schoning,</hi> with
between 8 and 10000 Men to ſeek out <hi>Bouflers,</hi> and to engage
him to fight; who having had notice of his March, retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his Men, ſo that <hi>Schoning</hi> returned before <hi>Bonne.</hi>
But this was not the only Interruption the Elector had in the
Siege; for Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> being apprehenſive he was too
weak for <hi>Humiers</hi> in Horſe, ſent for the States Horſe that
were before <hi>Bonne</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> conſiſting of 7 Regiments,
to which the Elector added 3 <hi>Brandenburg</hi> ones, commanded
by Count <hi>Flodorf.</hi> Neither was the Detachment he ſent to
the Camp before <hi>Mentz,</hi> upon the Requeſt of the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> leſs conſiderable, though that City, a little while
after they were gone, ſurrendred, and that Detachment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Camp again. However, his Army in the main
became conſiderably leſſened herein, ſo that all he could do
was to block up the Town, which yet he did ſo cloſely, that
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:62930:176"/>
nothing could either get in or go out. In the mean time the
Gariſon made ſeveral Sallies, wherein many Men were killed
on both ſides, and among the reſt they made one on the laſt
of <hi>Aug.</hi> with ſo much fury upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Quarter, that they
forced the Vanguard and broke in as far as the Tents, which
alarmed the whole Camp: But they met not with the ſame
Succeſs in that which they made the next day upon the <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterians,</hi>
for they were beaten back with the loſs of near 100
Men ſlain upon the ſpot, and 200 wounded.</p>
            <p>But how ſtrong ſoever the Gariſon was at the beginning of the Siege,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</note> theſe ſeveral Sallies muſt needs have conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly weakned them, and the News of the taking of <hi>Mentz,</hi>
which was proclaimed in the Elector's Camp by the diſcharge
of all the great Guns, could not be ſuppoſed to add any new
ſtrength to them. For on the contrary the Governor, when he
heard the noiſe of the Cannon, was ſo ſurprized that he ſent
out to know the reaſon; of which being well informed, he
could hardly believe it at firſt, ſo ſtrong was his Imagination
that the Town would have held out much longer. But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be true, and the Elector ſending him word it was
time to Capitulate, he began to make ſome Overtures, tho' they
were ſo unreaſonable, that his Highneſs would not accept of
them; but finding Gen. <hi>Sconing</hi> now returned to the Camp,
he reſolved to undertake the Siege vigorouſly, and not to
quit the Place till he had reduced it; which now was rendred
ſo much the more eaſie by a Reinforcement of 4000 Foot, and
1000 Horſe ſent him from <hi>Mentz,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> arriving
alſo in the Camp on the 25th of <hi>Sept.</hi> Wherefore the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and Batteries were haſtned with all Diligence, and
the Trenches at length carried on to the very Foot of the
Counterſcarp; and the Breaches being made, all things were
prepared ready for a general Aſſault. And they had fallen
on, the 5th or 6th of <hi>Oct.</hi> had it not been for the Rains which
fell two Days together: Therefore <hi>Sunday</hi> the 9th was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the Work: To this end, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were to
ſtorm the Horn-Work, while the <hi>Hollanders, Brandenburgers</hi>
and <hi>Munſterians</hi> attack'd the Counterſcarp of the Half-Moon
and Covert-Way. In purſuance hereof they all fell on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolved to vanquiſh, or die in the Attempt, and the
<hi>Brandenburgers</hi> firſt lodged themſelves upon the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp,
and drave the Enemy ſo far, that had the Breach been
wide enough for 4 Men abreaſt, they had entred the City
Pell-mell with the <hi>French,</hi> and taken it by main force. They
were harder put to it on the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> ſide, but after they
had been once repulſed, they lodged themſelves at laſt-upon
the Horn-work; tho' this Attack was not made without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
loſs. However, the Baron <hi>de Hasfield</hi> ſeeing the
Out works carried with ſo much Bravery, and fearing the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:62930:177"/>
Town would be taken by Storm, made it his chief Buſineſs to
capitulate: In purſuance whereof, Hoſtages were exchanged;
and after divers Diſputes and Conteſts, the Articles were
agreed on,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonne</hi> ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the Confederates.</note> and ratified the 12th of <hi>Oct.</hi> at 6 in the Afternoon,
whereby all the great Guns, Ammunition and Proviſion were
to remain in his Electoral Highneſs's diſpoſal, the <hi>Heſſian</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant,
Commiſſary of War, Treaſurer, Commiſſioner and
Receiver of the Contributions, to continue Priſoners of
War, and all things that were to be found in <hi>Specie,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Mainard</hi> Count <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> to be reſtored (for you
muſt know they had baſely ſeized upon that gallant Man's
Baggage ſome time before, for the ſake of the Plate and the
Jewels, of both which there were a conſiderable quantity)
with ſeveral other Particulars, too long here to be inſerted,
and with which we ſhall conclude the Campaign on the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ſide, and ſee what has been doing all this while in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
between the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Ottomans,</hi> ſince the Affairs
of <hi>Catalonia</hi> can give us no Interruption, there being nothing
memorable that paſſed this Seaſon between the Armies of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> on that ſide.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi>
               </note> who had been all along the Emperor's General in <hi>Hungary,</hi> while well, being recalled to ſerve this Campaign in the ſame Quality on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> of whoſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we have already given you the Particulars, his Imperial
Majeſty could think of no Perſon ſo fit to ſucceed him, as
Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> a worthy Choice indeed, and who
performed, even in this firſt Campaign, all, and more than
was, or well could be expected from him. About the 10th
of <hi>June</hi> he arrived at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> where he found only 13000
<hi>Germans,</hi> but they were followed by a greater Number; and
from thence he ſent Orders to <hi>Picolomini</hi> to come and join
him with that Body of the Army that was under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
deſigning to diſpute the Paſſage of the <hi>Morave</hi> with
the <hi>Turks,</hi> or to give them Battel, if they had paſs'd that
River already: But finding the <hi>Turks</hi> were not over-haſty to
meet him, and underſtanding they were ſo far from any
ſuch thing, that they had repaſs'd the <hi>Morave,</hi> and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
towards <hi>Niſſa,</hi> where all their Magazines lay, and where
they had ſtrongly entrench'd their Camp, the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
paſs'd that River over Bridges of Boats with his whole
Army, whom he ordered to take Proviſions along with them
for 3 Weeks, and marched directly towards <hi>Niſſa,</hi> with a
Reſolution to give the Enemy Battel, as being informed
their Army was not above 50000 ſtrong, and that of them
there was not above 10000 well diſciplined Men. But two
pieces of News that he received by the way, cauſed him to
ſuſpend his March; which were, firſt, That there had fallen
ſuch exceſſive Rains for ſome time, that had made the Ways
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:62930:177"/>
ſo bad, as it would be impoſſible for him to march with his
Army and Artillery, without endangering the ruining of both:
And the other was, That the <hi>Turks</hi> had made themſelves
Maſters of <hi>Zwornich,</hi> no ſtrong Place in it ſelf, but was a Poſt
that opened a Way into <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> into which Country the
<hi>Turks</hi> deſign'd to fall, as the Commander in the aforeſaid
Place, who defended it gallantly, and at laſt ſurrendred it
upon honourable Conditions, informed the Prince; who
thereupon ſent away to the Count <hi>de Cauriani</hi> to march forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
towards the <hi>Save,</hi> with all the Force he could draw
together, and hinder the Enemy from paſſing the River.
The Prince in the mean time returned with the Army to the
Fort they had built near <hi>Paſſarowitz,</hi> in order to ſecure the
Bridges they had laid over the <hi>Morave:</hi> And <hi>Aug.</hi> 27th the
Foot arrived near the Bridge at <hi>Grabovez,</hi> and the Horſe got
thither the next day.</p>
            <p>And tho' the <hi>Turks</hi> were no ſooner informed of theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and being incouraged, no doubt, by the Retreat of the Chriſtians, but they ſent the ſame Day a Detachment of Horſe
to fall upon the Foragers, they were valiantly repulſed: At the
ſame time another conſiderable Detachment of Cavalry was
ſent towards <hi>Semendria,</hi> where the Imperial Magazines lay,
with a Deſign to cut off the Prince's March, and hem in his
Army on all ſides. This being diſcovered by the Deſerters,
a Reſolution was taken to fall firſt upon the firſt Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and then to turn upon the other Part of the Enemy
which they had left behind, and which was not above an hour
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> March from the Chriſtians. To this effect the
Bridge being finiſhed, 500 Men under the command of two
Colonels, paſſed the River, and poſted themſelves on the
other ſide of the River the ſame Evening, being followed by
500 more, and in leſs than 3 hours had ſufficiently intrench'd
themſelves. Next Morning the Dragoons of <hi>Stirum</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rau</hi>

               </gap> between the Army and the

            <p>In the mean time the Infantry,<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Patochin.</hi>
               </note> commanded by Baron <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
and the Count <hi>de Starembergh,</hi> marched alſo to the Bridge,
being followed by the Baggage, and encamped in a very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Poſt, where they could not well be forced by
the Enemy; the Cavalry of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Left Wing advanced up an
Hill, and thoſe of the Right, into a Plain near <hi>Roſſava.</hi> And
that the Enemy might think their Deſign only was to ſecure
the Paſſage of the Infantry, one part of the Horſe were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to diſmount; Whereas, while this was doing, Colonel
<hi>de St Croix,</hi> with ſome hundreds of Horſe, together with the
Counts of <hi>Chakey, Deak</hi> and <hi>Buduani,</hi> with the <hi>Hungarians,
Raſcians</hi> and <hi>Huſſars</hi> getting before the Cavalry, through a
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:62930:178"/>
Valley, wherein they could not be diſcovered, flew with full
ſpeed upon the Enemy, and were ſeconded by the Cavalry,
who had opportunity during the Shock, to mount again.
The <hi>Turks</hi> retired ſlowly, thinking to draw the Chriſtians
into a Wood, behind which they had planted 10000 Men:
Tho' when they found themſelves charged by all the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Cavalry, they fell into ſome Diſorder, and were purſued
by the left Wing to a narrow Place, where they made an Halt.
But when the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> and General <hi>Veterani</hi> came up
with the Regiments of the right Wing, they retreated in
Confuſion to another Wood, where they were purſued for
an Hour and an half, till they came into a Plain. Here it was
the Chriſtians drew themſelves up in good Order of Battel,
and fell upon the rallied <hi>Turks</hi> with that reſolute Bravery,
that above 400 of their beſt Horſe were defeated upon the
Place, and a great number of Priſoners taken, among whom
was the Commander of the <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> together with 12 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets,
and ſome Kettle-Drums. The <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi>
purſued them a conſiderable way, killed a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and got a very large Booty, becauſe the Fliers threw away
their Baggage and their Arms, that they might the readier
make their Eſcape. The Cavalry returned the ſame day to
attack the other Party of the <hi>Turks,</hi> before they could join
the Fugitives. To this end, 500 Foot were detach'd to make
themſelves Maſters of a narrow Lanc at the Entrance of a
thick Wood, about an Hour and an halfs March long, into
which there was but one Way to enter, and beyond it the
Enemies Army was encamped in a large Plain. They quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beat off 3000 <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> and ſome Horſe that lay concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to hinder the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> from gaining it; which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
was not done without ſome loſs on both ſides. There
they ſtayed till the 30th, where all their Infantry came to
encamp in a Plain beyond the Wood, by the Favour of a
thick Miſt, having a Wood behind them to the Right, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Wood that ran out as far as the <hi>Morave,</hi> and the River
it ſelf on the Left. The Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> who had rejoyn'd
the Foot the Evening before, ordered the Horſe to re-paſs
the River, and poſt themſelves in the ſame place where the
Infantry had encamped the Night before, leaving on the
other ſide no more than 7 Squadrons of <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcians,</hi>
and ſome Horſe and Dragoons a foot, to guard the
Baggage. As ſoon as the Miſt cleared up, the <hi>Turks</hi> appeared
drawn up in Battel-array; and the Prince had hardly time
enough to range the ſecond Line of his Foot behind the firſt,
before the <hi>Turks,</hi> both Horſe and Foot, advanced upon him,
notwithſtanding whole Peals of Cannon, and Showers of ſmall
Shot poured in upon them. The Conflict laſted about 2
Hours, during which time both ſides kept continually firing;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:62930:178"/>
but General <hi>Caſtelli</hi> having got out of the Wood with his
Dragoons, the Enemy no ſooner heard the Trumpets and
Kettle-Drums of the firſt Squadron, but they began to retreat
into another Wood, and thereby gave the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to plant their Horſe behind their Infantry.</p>
            <p>It fortunately happened at the ſame time, that a <hi>Bavari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi>
who had been taken at the Siege of <hi>Buda,</hi> having made his
Eſcape, diſcovered that there was another Plain behind the
Wood, to which the Enemy retreated, where the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> lay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd.
Upon this, Count <hi>Staremberg</hi> having firſt view'd
the Road within the Wood, and finding it broad enough,
and withal, that it was not above 500 Paces long, and that
the <hi>Turks</hi> lay in their Entrenchments that were as ſo many
Fortreſſes for them; the Prince commanded him thither
with 300 Men, a Battalion of his own, and one of <hi>Starem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>'s,
and was followed by a good body of Infantry. With
theſe he bravely drave the Enemy from their 1<hi>ſt</hi> Entrenchment,
who thereupon retreated to their ſecond, about 100 Paces
further, and environed with a Moat full of Water, that was
not acceſſible on that ſide. However, they continued firing
from one Entrenchment unto another, for above an hour
and an half; ſo that many Soldiers were loſt here by the
<hi>Germans,</hi> together with 4 Captains, and a great many men
wounded. While this was in agitation, the firſt Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was levell'd for a Poſt for the Cavalry; and then <hi>Pico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini,</hi>
who had the Command of the Vanguard that day,
advanced both with the Horſe and Foot in good Order to
the ſecond Entrenchment. Count <hi>Palſi</hi> in the mean time
advanced croſs the Woods with his <hi>Heydukes,</hi> and making an
hideous Noiſe with his Trumpets to terrifie the Enemy, as
if there had been ſome conſiderable Body that was coming
to attack their Rear. This Stratagem took ſo well, that as
ſoon as they heard the Noiſe of the Trumpets and Kettle-Drums,
and ſaw <hi>Picolomini</hi> moving towards them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all their Vollies of ſmall Shot, they retreated athwart
another thick Wood, into their Camp, being purſued by the
<hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> though the ways were very narrow. But when
they came into open ground, Colonel <hi>Zand</hi> was ſent with a
Regiment to fall on their Rear, being followed by all the
Horſe, Regiment by Regiment. <hi>Zand</hi> with his own Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that of <hi>Serau,</hi> drave the Infidels from the Wood,
and forced them into their Camp, which was upon an Hill
near <hi>Patochin,</hi> and then ſtaid till other Troops came up with
him: But a great Shower falling at that time, and the Night
coming on, he fell upon the Enemy, now under great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation,
with thoſe 2 Regiments only, put them to the
Rout, and forced them to quit their Camp, of which the
Chriſtians became Maſters, and where they ſound 105 Pieces
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:62930:179"/>
of Cannon, 3 Mortars, ſeveral Bombs, a great quantity of
Ammunition, Proviſion, Waggons, Camels, Oxen, Bufalo's,
Tents, and other Riches. Some of the Enemy eſcaped to
<hi>Jagodin,</hi> others to <hi>Krakolovez,</hi> being purſu'd ſtill by the
<hi>Hungarians,</hi> who kill'd divers of them, and found ſome
Pieces of Cannon, and other Arms, in the Mountains.
Though the number of the Slain was not ſo conſiderable in
theſe Onſets, yet the Advantage therein, as well as in the
great Booty the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> got, was manifeſtly on their ſide
every way, which will yet farther appear by the ſucceeding
Actions of this Campaign.</p>
            <p>I am loth to make any interruption in this Place in the reſt of the Succeſſes of the Imperial Arms (and the rather, ſince it has not been my Cuſtom upon other occaſions) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
as I preſume it to be pardonable for once, I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
before I proceed any further, That tho' his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was without doubt much pleas'd already with his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
on this ſide, yet thoſe towards <hi>France</hi> ſeemed moſtly at
this time to take up the Thoughts of this Court, which was
now at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> whither the Electors and other Princes of
the Empire were to come. The outward Appearance of
things was ſuch, as if there were nothing but the Coronation
of the Empreſs aud the Election of a King of the <hi>Romans</hi> in
view: But the particular Deſign was undoubtedly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert
Meaſures and agree upon what Enterprizes were to be
undertaken the following Spring, and to find a way to defray
the extraordinary Charges of ſuch a neceſſary and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
War, as that wherein they were engaged againſt <hi>France;</hi>
wherein, how well or ill they ſucceeded, will beſt appear by
the ſequel of this Hiſtory. But however <hi>France</hi> might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with theſe Proceedings and Deſigns (of which ſhe
could not be ignorant) ſhe had ſome ſort of ſatisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this time to get rid of one turbulent, tho' inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Enemy, in reſpect to others, and that was the <hi>Algerine,</hi>
who now made a Peace with her upon theſe Terms.</p>
            <p>That all Prizes that were taken on both ſides,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>French</hi> make Peace with the <hi>Algerines.</hi>
               </note> till the 24th of <hi>September</hi> (which was the day of the Ratification of the Treaty) ſhould be good; but that all that were taken on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide ſince the Ratification, ſhould be reſtored. The <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines</hi>
engaged themſelves to come into the Ocean with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Sail, to Pyrate upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and were to be
admitted into all the Ports of <hi>France,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Brest,</hi>
and ſhould be further furniſhed with all things neceſſary for
their Money; but what Veſſels they took upon the Ocean
were to belong to the French King, tho' the Lading was to
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:62930:179"/>
be theirs. And finally, whereas his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty was
unwilling they ſhould make any Slaves, they engaged to let
him have the Priſoners delivered to him at ſo much a Head.</p>

being in a condition to enter <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> as before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they had
intended, that they had quitted the Enterprize of <hi>Seback,</hi>
and not only ſo, but forſaken <hi>Zwornich,</hi> after having firſt
plundered and burnt it, becauſe they did not conceive it
tenable, and were retired towards <hi>Niſſa,</hi> and being willing
to improve the preſent Conſternation of the Enemy, and
take the opportunity of the fair Weather, reſolved with the
Imperial Army, conſiſting of about 16 or 17000 Men, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
towards <hi>Niſſa,</hi> where he happily arrived after ſeveral
long Marches on the 23d of <hi>Sept.</hi> and ranged them in order
of Battel that very day. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army day encamped
before the place, from <hi>Niſſa</hi> to the top of the Hill that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
it; he found them intrenched in their Camp much
more regularly than the <hi>Turks</hi> were wont to do, which made
it to be believed, that ſome Chriſtian had been their Director.
Beſides this, they were invironed with a deep Moat well pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſado'd,
and the River that ran through the City, and which
was very rapid, ſecured then on the other ſide, ſo that there
was no poſſibility of attacking them any way but behind,
where their Camp was only acceſſible. Nothing paſſed that
day, ſave ſome petty Skirmiſhes between the Volunteers of
the Imperial Camp, and ſome Troops of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> but the
next day the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> decamped an hour before day; the
left Wing followed by the Baggage, took their way to the
left ſide of a Mountain, over which they were to march, and
where they made an Halt, until the right Wing commanded
by the Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> had joined them; then the whole Army
deſcended into a Valley in Battel-array, at what time the
Enemy ſhowed themſelves upon another little Hill, over
which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were alſo to paſs, before they came in
ſight of the <hi>Infidel</hi>'s Camp, making a ſhew as if they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to come down, and to charge the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> who no
ſooner perceived them, than that they boldly advanced to
meet them. But the <hi>Turks</hi> not thinking it convenient to
tarry, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> advanced to the top of the Hill, without
any oppoſition, where they found themſelves near the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Intrenchments, and perceived it was impoſſible to force
them on that ſide, with an Army not half ſo numerous as
the Enemy. Whereupon it was concluded they ſhould ſeek
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:62930:180"/>
out a more acceſſible place, and to that purpoſe they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
along a Valley, coaſting the Enemy that lay on the right
ſide, with a deſign to fall upon them in the Rear: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were not well acquainted with the Ways, Count
<hi>Cziaki</hi> was ſent out with a Party of <hi>Huſſars</hi> to view the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
on that ſide. In the mean time ſeveral ſlight Skirmiſhes
paſſed betvveen Parties of both Armies, which however did
not hinder the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> from keeping on their Way, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
Count <hi>Cziaki,</hi> who returned at length, and aſſured
them they might march on without any danger; the which
was alſo confirmed by a Priſoner taken at the ſame time,
who added withal, that behind the Hills, which the Army
had in view before it, there were two Villages upon the
left, and to the right a ſpacious Plain, large enough to
embattle the Army, and where they might attack the Enemy's
Rear.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Turks</hi> perceived the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Deſigns, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to intrench that part of the Camp which they had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected before, not dreaming of being attack'd that way;
The Flower of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> were ordered to guard the
Hills, which they ſaw the right Wing of the Chriſtians going
to poſſeſs themſelves of, and ſent out 4000 Horſe, to charge
the Rear of the left Wing, commanded by <hi>Picolomini,</hi> who
ſending out a Detachment of 3 Squadrons of <hi>Noirkermer</hi>'s
Regiment, they charged the Enemy ſo briskly that they were
repulſed, and purſued above 300 Paces.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the right Wing was engaged with the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who made a ſtout reſiſtance, and coſt the life of the brave Major-General <hi>Vellon;</hi> but the Chriſtians rather ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
than born down with the reſiſtance they met with,
redoubled their Fury, and after they had beaten off the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries,</hi>
gained the Hill, whither they brought their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
and played briskly upon the Enemy, who were retired
into a bottom, from whence they alſo fired continually upon
the Chriſtians. And now the <hi>Spahi</hi>'s, who had been beaten
by a Detachment of the left Wing, returned again to the
Charge, endeavouring ſtill all they could to flank the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and fell on with much greater Fury than before, as if
the Ignominy of their flight had given life anew to their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
This on-ſet was firmly ſuſtained by <hi>Pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Heydukes,</hi> who being ſeconded by others, put the

fired upon them; which being done alſo by the <hi>Turks</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:62930:180"/>
But alas; that ſerved only to augment the Confuſion that
was already very great in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army: For the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
taking advantage of the diſorders, flew upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
from all parts, who then betook themſelves to their
Heels, not knowing whither to fly; So that only Night pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
them from the fury of the Victors. But ſeveral of
them in ſeeking to ſave their Lives in the Dark, not being
able, becauſe of that, to find the way to the Bridge, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
in hopes to paſs the River, to eſcape by ſwimming;
but the ſtream was ſo rapid that moſt of them were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
inſomuch that of all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cavalry, there were but
very few that eſcaped: In their Camp the Imperialiſts found
great ſtore of Utenſils for Pioneers, 30 Pieces of Cannon of
an extraordinary bigneſs, of which ſome were four ſquare, a
great Number of Carcaſſes, Glaſs Granadoes, Biſquet, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
Rice, Meal, Oats, Tobacco, Camels, and other things;
but of all the Plunder the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> reſerved only for
himſelf the <hi>Seraſquier</hi>'s Tent, which was very magnificent, and
which had been ſent him by the Grand-viſier, in regard he had
loſt his own in the former Battel. After the Army had pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged
the Camp they entred <hi>Niſſa,</hi> without oppoſition, where
they found Proviſions enough for the Subſiſtence of the whole
Army for 5 or 6 Weeks,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Niſſa</hi> taken by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts.</note> and took above 3000 Horſes and
Mules; and what ſtill made this Victory the more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
was the ſmallneſs of the Imperialiſts loſs, there being
not above 300 killed, and not many more wounded, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Turks</hi> were computed to have been worſe for this Battle
by 8000 Men.</p>
            <p>The Prince ſtill to purſue this great advantage diſpatcht away the very next day 3000 Horſe, under the Command of <hi>Picolomini,</hi> to look after the fugitive <hi>Turks,</hi> with orders
to advance as far as <hi>Sophia,</hi> and view the Country, who
returned the 13th of <hi>Sept.</hi> without having been able to meet
with any of the Enemy, but reported the Countrey was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good, having ſuffered but little by the War; that he
had put Garriſons into <hi>Pio</hi> and <hi>Muſſa Pafora,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi>
had quitted upon his Approach; and that he underſtood by
ſome Priſoners he had taken, that the Infidels were retired
to <hi>Sophia,</hi> where they endeavoured to rally their broken
Troops. This Intelligence moved the Prince to fortifie <hi>Niſſa,</hi>
and ſo much the rather, becauſe the Country People, who
came in great Numbers to implore his Protection, aſſured
him, that the Country was good and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſufficient to furniſh an Army with all neceſſary Proviſions;

Mean while the Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> not willing to conclude this
glorious Campaign with this laſt Action, ſet forward <hi>Oct.</hi>
6th with his Army for <hi>Widin,</hi> another important Place, with
a good Caſtle upon the <hi>Danube;</hi> and upon the 11th arrived
at <hi>Breſlau,</hi> where he ſtaid one Day in expectation of the
Baggage, and from thence ſent a Detachment of <hi>Germans</hi>
and <hi>Hungarians</hi> to view the Country, and to get ſome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Enemy. Theſe returned next Day with ſome
Priſoners, and reported that the two <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s were retired near
<hi>Widin,</hi> with their Forces, and that <hi>Tekeley</hi> had taken the Road
to <hi>Sophia.</hi> Hereupon the Prince re-ſumed his March, and on
the 14th by 10 in the Morning got to the Plains of <hi>Widin,</hi>
when the Enemy, who knew nothing of the Army's March,
were ſtrangely ſurprized to ſee the Imperial Foragers foraging
very near their Camp; and their Conſternation was ſo great,
that before they could recover themſelves, the Prince his
right Wing had paſſed the great ſtone Bridges that were built
upon the <hi>Moras,</hi> and was drawn up in Battle-array, expecting
the coming up of the left Wing, which paſſed immediately
after. Neither did the Enemy endeavour to hinder them,
which gave the right Wing, an opportunity to take up their
Poſts very near the City, and to ſecure themſelves with the
<hi>Danube.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> ſeemed at firſt very couragious, but they
were charged with ſo much bravery by the right Wing,
where the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> was in Perſon, that they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to an Intrenchment they had made about the Town,
upon whom however the Imperial Cavalry advanced, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Fire of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> which killed ſome Horſe-men,
and made the reſt recoil: Yet they preſently rallied again
behind a riſing Ground, and advanced within 40 Paces of the
Enemy's Moats, where they ſtood their Ground, till the reſt
of the right Wing had planted themſelves near a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
that was there.</p>
            <p>In the mean time General <hi>Veterani</hi> who commanded the left Wing, ordered 200 Dragoons to alight, and attack the Enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the beſieged upon better Thoughts would not ſtay for the
Cannon, and therefore upon the 18th of <hi>Oct.</hi> they capitulated,
to march out of the Place with Arms and Baggage, and
were conducted by Water to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> with which the Prince

things were tranſacted in the Field, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Embaſſadors
at <hi>Vienna,</hi> for ſome part of the time, preſſed very much the
Negotiations of Peace, wherein they found the Emperour
but little diſpoſed: Yet having at length received ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
from the Grand-Seignior, they themſelves grew much
more remiſs in their inſtances; The reaſon whereof the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and his Allies could not well penetrate into: And
therefore to ſound them the more, it was thought fit the
Pretenſions of the Allies ſhould have been imparted to them, to
ſee whether they had any orders to conclude upon thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
which Propoſals were: 1. That the Kingdom of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garry,</hi>
ſhould be reſtored with all its Dependances, and the
Principality of <hi>Boſnia,</hi> in ſuch a manner, that the Grand-Seignior
ſhould never more claim any right therein. 2. That
<hi>Moldavia, Walachia,</hi> and the Republick of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> which
had put themſelves under the Emperor's Protection, ſhould
be comprized in the Treaty of Peace, and not to be diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Turks</hi> in any manner whatſoever. 3. That all the
<hi>Tartars</hi> ſhould depart the Countries. 4. That the Port
ſhould pay 6000000 towards the Expences of the War, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the Concluſion of the Peace, and 2000000
every Year for free Paſſage to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> 5. That all
the Chriſtians that had been taken during the War, which
were above 1000000 ſhould be ſet at liberty; laſtly, that
<hi>Tekeley,</hi> and all his Adherents ſhould be delivered up to the
Emperor. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> demanded the reſtitution of
<hi>Caminiec,</hi> and 4000000 in Silver. And for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they
required, 1. The reſtitution of all the Iſlands that formerly
belonged to them, and particularly the Iſland of <hi>Negr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

2. The reſtitution of the Dukedom of <hi>Athens.</hi> 3. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change

and <hi>Mahona.</hi> 5. A Regulation of the Limits of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Cities, and Countries: And laſtly, that the Grand-Seignior
ſhould pay to the Republick 400000 Ducats.</p>
            <p>But theſe Propoſitions ſeemed ſo unreaſonable to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, that they tore their Beards upon it; However, they delivered a Letter to the Imperial Commiſſioners,
which the Grand-Seignior had written to the Emperour;
Within which, it was thought ſome Offers and Propoſals
tending to a Peace might be met with. But they were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:62930:182"/>
to find nothing but Complements, and the Imperial
Court was ſo incenſed at it, that they ſent Orders for the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
Embaſſadors to be gone; but while they were prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for their departure, word was ſent them that they might
ſtay, till the Return of the Couriers from <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi>
to know the final Reſolutions of thoſe two Republicks. At
laſt depart they did, but ſtopped at <hi>Commorra,</hi> and after a
long ſtay there, got leave at length to return, leaving the
Peace that way deſperate, and the War to be proſecuted with
as great fury as ever.</p>
            <p>But how high ſoever the Demands of the <hi>Venetians</hi> were in their Propoſals of Peace, they muſt have proceeded from another Motive, whatever it were, than the Operations of
this Compagne, which proved very unſucceſsful to them, as

that way: Which being effected, they drew off the reſt of

ended their moſt important Affairs towards the beginning of

preceding Reigns, to have been abſolutely to annihilate the
Authority of Parliaments; and that King <hi>James</hi> in particular
had gone a great way towards the introducing the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
into the Nation, they took eſpecial care to prevent the

Authority, That the Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:62930:183"/>
be obliged at their coming to the Crown to take the Teſt in
the firſt Parliament that ſhould be called at the beginning of
their Reign; and in the Bill of Succeſſion added a Clauſe,
<hi>That if any King or Queen of</hi> England <hi>ſhould embrace the</hi>
Roman Catholick Religion, <hi>or Marry with a</hi> Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prince <hi>or</hi> Princeſs, <hi>their Subjects ſhould be abſolved from

ſhould take up Arms againſt the King, after the 24th of <hi>Feb.</hi>
or ſhould hold Correſpondence with his Enemies, ſhould be
guilty of high Treaſon; And granted the King 2 Shillings
in the Pound upon Land, with the neceſſary Clauſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions;
and appropriated Part of the Mony for Payment
of the Seamen, and ſetting out the Fleet. After this, being
prorogued to the 12th of <hi>Apr.</hi> they were by Proclamation
diſſolved upon the 6th of <hi>Febr.</hi> and the King by the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
called a Parliament to meet on the 30th of <hi>March,</hi>
to whom he delivered himſelf to this Effect:</p>
            <q>
               <p>That being reſolved to omit nothing on his Part, that might contribute to the Peace and Proſperity of the Nation; and to that end, believing his Preſence abſolutely neceſſary in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the
Reducing of that Kingdom, he had called them together, to deſire
their Aſſiſtance, that he might be in a Capacity to carry on the
War there with Speed and Vigour. To which purpoſe he deſired
them to haſten the ſettling of the Revenues of the Crown, and
that he might have a Fund in the mean time ſettled, upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
whereof, he might raiſe Mony for the preſent Exigences of the
Nation.</p>
               <p>Then he recommended to them the paſſing of an Act of Oblivion, ſuch as he had ordered to be drawn up for the preventing the loſs of time uſually ſpent in Deliberations of that kind, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
but few were excepted, that his Subjects might ſee he had no
other Intentions, but ſuch as were conformable to the Laws of the
Land, and to leave thoſe without Excuſe, that ſhould go about to
diſturb the Government in his Abſence. And laſtly, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them the Vnion with <hi>Scotland;</hi> and then informed them,
That he intended, during his Abſence, to leave the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Government in the Hands of the Queen, and deſired
them to prepare an Act to that Purpoſe; concluding with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Deſire, that they would be as ſpeedy in the Diſpatch of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
as poſſibly they could, in regard his Expedition into <hi>Ireland</hi>
would not admit of any long Seſſion.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Parliament went roundly to work upon this Speech of the King's, yet ſo that it took up ſome time before they could bring all their Matters to bear; But at length the Act
of Oblivion, after many Difficulties removed, and ſo long
deſired by the King, was approved and paſt; ſo was another
for putting the Adminiſtration of the Government into the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:62930:183"/>
Queen's Hands, not only during the King's Abſence in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
but when-ever his Affairs ſhould call him out of the Kingdom.
They alſo found out Ways to raiſe the Subſidies that were
granted, ſettled the Revenues, and divers Perſons did in the
mean time, advance Money for the King's preſent Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and that nothing might happen to the Prejudice of the
Government, while the King was abſent, the Deputy-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
of the Counties were authorized to raiſe the Militia
in caſe of neceſſity, and all Roman Catholicks ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to their places of Abode, and not to ſtir above 5 Miles
from thence, without leave; and all that held any Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the State, tho' never ſo inconſiderable, to ſwear Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to the King and Queen. Thus Matters being brought
to a good Concluſion, his Majeſty, after returning them his
Thanks, Prorogued them to the 17th of <hi>June,</hi> and then

yet continued ſtill in a Body, and took their Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to make frequent Incurſions into the Low-lands to
plunder and ſpoil, more like a Company of <hi>Banditti,</hi> than
Regular Troops; over whom the Government there, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
kept a vigilant Eye, and detected ſome Correſpondence
held between them and other Perſons in <hi>Edenburg</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
who before pretended to be Friends, but it ended in
the cloſe Confinement of them; Yet notwithſtanding all this,
they could not prevent them from receiving ſome Succour
from without. For King <hi>James,</hi> notwithſtanding the Delay
of the French Succours which did not arrive in <hi>Ireland</hi> before
the 4th of <hi>March,</hi> yet built ſo very much upon them, that
tho' he had neither Ammunition nor Proviſion to ſpare, he
cauſed in the mean time two Frigats to be rigged up at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
laden with Cloaths, Arms and Ammunition, and ſent
them away to his Friends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> having beſides on Board
them, Colonel <hi>Buchan,</hi> Colonel <hi>Wauhup,</hi> and about 40 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion-Officers
more, who had all the good Luck to get
ſafe into the Iſle of <hi>Mull.</hi> With this Reinforcement they were
ſo incouraged, that ſometime after that, they adventured, to
the number of 1500, to march as far as <hi>Strathſpag,</hi> in the
County of <hi>Murray,</hi> which Sir <hi>Thomas Levingſtone</hi> no ſooner
underſtood, and being unwilling to give them any Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for a farther Acceſſion of Strength, in being joyned with
other Malecontents, but he took along with him 800 Foot,
6 Troops of Dragoons, and 2 Troops of Horſe, and fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them ſo ſuddenly, that the Horſe and Dragoons entring
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:62930:184"/>
their Camp, put them into ſuch an immediate Confuſion,
that they betook themſelves to flight, leaving between 4 and
500 of their Number ſlain upon the Spot, an 100 taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
and among them 4 Captains, 3 Lieutenants, and 2 En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns;
nor had any of them eſcaped, had not a thick Miſt fell
in the height of the Execution. This was no ſooner done,
but Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> advanced to the Caſtle of <hi>Lethirgdey,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Colonel <hi>Buchan</hi>'s Nephew, and having lodged a Mine
under it, quickly brought the Garriſon to ſurrender at Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
Neither was Major <hi>Ferguſon</hi> leſs ſucceſsful in the Iſle
of <hi>Mull,</hi> where he landed and deſtroy'd ſeveral Places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Enemy, forcing them to deſert the Caſtle of
<hi>Dewart,</hi> and betake themſelves to the Hills. Nor yet was
the Blow given them by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Parliament of leſs Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
for beſides their Paſſing an Act to reſtore the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Miniſters that were thruſt from their Churches ſince
the 1ſt of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1661. they made another, declaring all thoſe
Rebels that were actually in Arms againſt the King and
Queen.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the ill Succeſs of the <hi>Jacobites</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites Plot.</note>
the whole Party would not ſeem thereby to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
eſpecially thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> who thought it a very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
Seaſon, while the King was abſent, to attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
conſiderable to the Advantage of their Cauſe; And
therefore having timely concerted Matters with their Friends
on the other ſide of the Water, it was ſo agreed, That while
part of the French Fleet ſhould bear up into the <hi>Thames,</hi> to
favour and aſſiſt the Deſigns of thoſe that were in <hi>London,</hi>
who were very numerous by the flocking of a great many
of the Conſpirators from all Parts of the Country thither,
they were to have made an Inſurrection in ſeveral Places at
once. Certain Perſons were to have taken upon them the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Affairs, till the Return of King <hi>James,</hi> who
was to leave the Command of his Army to his Generals, and
haſten with all Speed into <hi>England.</hi> The other part of the
French Fleet having joyned their Gallies, was to have land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
8000 Men at <hi>Torbay,</hi> with Arms for a greater Number;
after which the Gallies and Men of War were to Sail into the
Iriſh Sea, to hinder the Return of King <hi>William</hi> and his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Their Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> was to have revolted at the
ſame time in ſeveral Parts of that Kingdom. But however,
the Matter was in reality, the whole Contrivance ſeems to
have been founded upon a Preſumption, if not Aſſurance of
the Engliſh Fleet, being firſt beaten by the French; of which
whether they had any foreſight otherwiſe than from the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of the Strength, which was conſiderably at this time
to the Advantage of <hi>France,</hi> I am not able to unriddle.
Yet, the Conſpiracy by the timous Diſcovery of it, proved
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:62930:184"/>
a vain Contrivance, tho' the Grounds upon which the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
thereof ſeemed to depend, proved but too ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>For all the French Fleet having entred the Channel, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerted, they veered ſome time upon the Engliſh Coaſt, as expecting the Effect of the Conſpiracy, which was
to have broken out the 18th of <hi>June;</hi> of which the Queen
had no ſooner notice, but ſhe ſent the Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> who
was Admiral, Orders to fight the Enemy what-ever befel
him, as knowing they could have no good Deſign by coming
ſo near us. But how diſhonourable ſoever this Action ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be to the Engliſh Nation, yet there was one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that attended it, that was ſomewhat favourable; For
the People generally were poſſeſs'd with an Opinion of the
Engliſh Seamens Courage and Bravery, above thoſe of the
French; and many with ſo high a Conceit of the Admiral
that Commanded them, that it was ſome days before they
could be brought to be perſwaded of the Truth of what had
happened; And their Concern about it, even then, was
much alleviated by the good News we had of his Majeſty's
Succeſs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the Battle at the <hi>Boyne,</hi> which was
fought the day after, and of which by and by. But we muſt
firſt return where we left off in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that was to the
Army going from <hi>Dundalk</hi> into their Winter Quarters, and
take a ſhort View of the State of things there till the King's
Arrival.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dundalk</hi>- Camp was not the only the Place that proved fatal to our Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi>

among the former Colonel <hi>Langſton</hi> departed this Life of a

of the ſame Diſtemper at <hi>Cheſter:</hi> So that about the
beginning of the new Year ſeveral Regiments were broke
into others, and the Officers continued at half Pay, till
Proviſion could be made for them in other Regiments, whilſt
others went over into <hi>England</hi> for Recruits. However,
Sickneſs by degrees abating, about the beginning of <hi>Febr.</hi>
they found both Men and Horſes, ſuch as ſurvived, in pretty
good Heart; when the General, being informed that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
were drawing down ſome Forces towards <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and
that they had laid in great Store of Corn, Hay and other
Proviſions, with a Deſign from thence to diſturb our Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
Garriſons, ſent a conſiderable Body of Horſe and Foot
that way, himſelf following them on the 11th towards <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
in order to wait the Enemies Motion; But the Iriſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
at this time lay another way: For while the Duke was
upon this Expedition, there was Notice given Colonel <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

that they had a Deſign to fall upon <hi>Belturbet,</hi> which he
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62930:185"/>
had taken from them a little before; and that to that end a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
number of them were advanced to <hi>Cavan,</hi> and more
to follow; who thereupon marched diligently from <hi>Belturbet</hi>
with 700 Foot and 300 Horſe and Dragoons in the Evening
towards them, as thinking to ſurprize them next Morning
ealry, they being not above 8 Miles off: But he met with
ſo many Difficulties in his March, that inſtead of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
day light at the Place he deſigned, it was not only half
an hour after break of day before he came in ſight of it, but
alſo the Enemy had got notice of his coming: So that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of ſurprizing them, he might well have been ſurprized
himſelf. For the firſt thing he ſaw, was a Body of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
drawn up in good Order, and might conſiſt of about
4000 Men; but there being no retreating now either with
Honour or Safety, the Colonel was reſolved to ſtand ſtoutly
to it;<note place="margin">Col. <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of being brave, and the inevitable Ruin of the whole
Party, if they proved otherwiſe; and thereupon finding them
very compliant to his Deſire, he ſent a Party of <hi>Iniskilling</hi>
Dragoons towards the Enemy, who were preſently charged by
a great Body of their Horſe, and beat back paſt the Front of
their own Foot, who were ſo enraged at them, that ſome of
Major General <hi>Kirk</hi>'s Men, and Colonel <hi>Wharton</hi>'s fired up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and killed 7 or 8 of the number; but ſome of the
Enemies Horſe purſued them ſo far, that many of them
were killed by our Foot as they endeavoured to get
off.</p>
            <p>By this time the Body of the Party was advanced near the Iriſh, who were poſted upon the top of a riſing Ground, not far from the Town; and who, as our Men advanced up the
Hill, fired a whole Volley upon them, and then ſet up an
Huzza, but ſcarce killed a Man, their Shot flying over them.
Our Men however went on till they came within Piſtol-ſhot,
and then fired, which ſo galled the Iriſh, that they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
retired towards the Town, and entred into a Fort
they had there, and from whence they ſallied and made a
very fierce Attack upon the Engliſh, who had too ſpeedily
fallen to Plunder. But <hi>Woolſley</hi> having 250 Foot, and about
80 Horſe for a Reſerve, the Enemy were beat off again, their
Horſe flying quite beyond the Town, and the Foot retiring
to the Fort again. The Soldiers got good ſtore of Shoes and
other things in the Place, but their Ammunition was blown
up, and their Proviſions deſtroy'd; for the Colonel was
forced to ſet the Town on fire, to get his Men out in the
time of the Sally, as not knowing what might happen: The
Enemy's Loſs in that Action was conſiderable, and ſo much
the more advantageous to the Engliſh; in that it broke the
Neck of a Deſign the Iriſh had of drawing together a Body
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:62930:185"/>
of 10000 Men at <hi>Cavan,</hi> to fall upon <hi>Belturbet,</hi> and other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and gave Colonel <hi>Woolſley</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Apr.</hi>
an opportunity to take the Caſtle of <hi>Killiſhandra,</hi> with whoſe
Services the General was very well pleaſed; who upon that
ſent him a Battalion of <hi>Danes,</hi> that were lately landed in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to reinforce him at <hi>Belturbet.</hi> About the ſame time
Sir <hi>John Lanier,</hi> with a Party of a 1000 Horſe, Foot, and
Dragoons, made an Attempt upon <hi>Dundalk,</hi> took <hi>Bedloe</hi>- Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
and the Enſign that Commanded there, and brought
from beyond the Town and about it, about 1500 Cows and
Oxen. The Enſign was carried to <hi>Lisburn,</hi> and brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the General into his Garden, where he commonly uſed
to walk before Dinner; who before he asked him any Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
gave him a pretty Caution to be ſincere in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers;
ſaying, <hi>You have a Commiſſion, and for that Reaſon, if
not otherwiſe, you are a Gentleman; This obliges you to ſpeak
Truth, which if you do not, I can know it by examining other
Priſoners, and then I ſhall have no good Opinion of you.</hi> But
for all this, and what-ever elſe he told him afterward in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
he could get little or nothing out of him that was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</p>
            <p>But King <hi>James</hi> did not ſeem to be ſo ſenſibly concerned at theſe Diſadvantages, ſo remote from him in the North, as he was at the loſs of the only Man of War, I think, he
had in his Poſſeſſion; and of which, though in it ſelf no ſuch
conſiderable Action, as might merit a room in this Treatiſe;
Yet there are ſome Circumſtances belonging to it that are
engaging enough, and will not permit me to paſs it over in
ſilence. Sir <hi>Cloveſly Shovell</hi> being about the 12th of <hi>Apr.</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> as Convoy to divers Ships, that carried over
Neceſſaries for the Army, and there having Intelligence of

Bay; And there leaving the <hi>Monk,</hi> and ſome other great
Ships, he took the <hi>Monmouth-Yatch,</hi> and one or two more,
with ſeveral long Boats, and went up to <hi>Polley,</hi> where the
Frigat lay, being one half of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Fleet, that was taken
in the Channel the preceding Year, carrying 16 Guns, and
4 Pattereroes: King <hi>James</hi> when he was advertiſed of it,
ſaid, <hi>It was ſome of his Loyal Subjects of</hi> England, <hi>that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to their Duty and Allegiance.</hi> But he was quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of his Miſtake, when he ſaw them draw near the
Ship, and heard the firing; and therefore he rid out towards
<hi>Rings-End,</hi> where a vaſt croud of People of all ſorts gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, and ſeveral Regiments were drawn out, to kill,
if it were poſſible, thoſe bold Fellows at Sea, who durſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch a good day perform ſo wicked a Deed, as they phraſed
it. Captain <hi>Bennet</hi> who Commanded the Frigat run her a

ground, and after ſeveral firings, when they ſaw a Fire-ſhip
coming in, which Sir <hi>Clouveſly</hi> had given the ſignal for; the
Men who were about 40, of which they loſt 6 or 7 in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
quitted her, and our Men took her; but in her going
off one of her Hoys run aground and was dry, when the Tide
was gone out, tho' the reſt of the Boats were not a far off
being full of armed Men; and a Frenchman of K. <hi>James</hi> his
Guards coming nigh the Boats to fire his Piſtols in a bravado,
had his Horſe ſhot under him, and was forced to fling away
his Jack-boots, to run away in his Stockings to ſave himſelf,
leaving his Saddle and Accouterments to ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Seamen, who would go aſhoar to fetch them off: King <hi>James</hi>
went back much concerned at the Adventure, and 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
he ſhould ſay, <hi>That all the Proteſtants in</hi> Ireland <hi>were of</hi>
Cromwell'<hi>s breed, and deſerved to have their Throats cut,</hi> which
if true, argued no great Stock of Diſcretion in him, however
all the Proteſtants that walked that way during the Action,
were ſecured in Priſon, and only two of them made their
Eſcape to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boats.</p>

               </gap>trong place, both by Nature and Art, as being ſeated upon
a piece of Ground in the middle of a Bay, and only acceſſible
by two ways, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had partly broke down; but
what was deſigned by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> for its relief and ſecurity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the loſs of it. For <hi>Mack-Mahon</hi> with a Detachment of
between 4 and 500 Men, having in the Night got over the
Bogs, into the Place, with Ammunition, and ſome ſmall Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Proviſion, Monſieur <hi>Daveſant, Cambon</hi>'s Lieutenant
Collonel having notice of it, and that they deſigned to return
in a ſmall time, divided his Men into 3 parts: When the 3d
Night after their going in, they were marching out again,
near to Captain <hi>la Carry</hi>'s Poſt, who had 40 Men with him,
He let their Van paſs him, and then fired upon their main
Body, killing 8 of them with an Officer, and forcing the reſt
into <hi>Charlemont,</hi> who for haſt left 110 Muſkets, 6 Halbards,
ſome Drumms, and ſeveral other things behind them, the
ſame ill ſucceſs they met with in the other Attempts then
made: But when the Blockade was re-inforced from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
who, ſome ſaid, knew of <hi>Mack-Mahou</hi>'s going in, and
ordered them to ſuffer him to paſs, that their ſtay might
bring the Garriſon the ſooner low, and ſo be forced to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render;
The <hi>Iriſh</hi> made no further Attempt to eſcape, but
it had almoſt been as well for them to have fallen into the
Hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as to be beat back as they were, For
old <hi>Teague O Regan,</hi> the Governour, was ſo angry with them
for it, that he ſwore, <hi>If they could not get out, they ſhould have
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:62930:186"/>
no entertainment nor lodging within;</hi> And he was as good as his
Word, for they were forced to make little Huts in the dry
Ditch within the Paliſadoes, and upon the Counterſcarp,
few or none of them being permitted to go within the Gates
of the Caſtle; ſo that between the one and the other, the
poor Fellows were in a miſerable plight.</p>
            <p>The General being reſolved to poſſeſs himſelf of the Place, ſent ſeveral Regiments that way, who encamped almoſt round it, having ſome time before ſent old <hi>Teague</hi> a ſummons to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render;
but he was then very ſurly, and bid the Meſſenger
tell his Maſter from old <hi>Teague O Regan, That he was an old
Knave, and by St.</hi> Patrick, <hi>he ſhould not have the Town at all;</hi>
At which Anſwer, the Duke only ſmiled, ſaying, <hi>He would
give</hi> Teague <hi>greater reaſons to be angry in a ſhort time,</hi> and ſo
indeed it proved: For our Forces now lying ſo near them,
and two Detachments being kept there againſt their Wills,
made every thing ſo very ſcarce, that they were reduced to
great ſtraits; And no hopes of relief appearing, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
upon the 12th of <hi>May,</hi> having leave from the Officer,
commanding without,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charlemont</hi> ſurrendred.</note> and a Guard for them, ſent a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Collonel, and a Captain, with Terms of Surrender to
the Duke, which with ſome Alterations were agreed to: For
the Duke had an Account that the Place was very ſtrong, and
therefore he choſe rather to give them Terms, than to ſpend
much time about it, ſince there were greater matters in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
The Articles were no ſooner ſigned, and a Truce
publiſhed, but the General ſent <hi>Robert Alloway,</hi> Eſq, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary
of the Train, to take an account of the Stores in the
Garriſon, which marched out at the time appointed, and then
drew up before the Gate. 4 Companies of Collonel <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
marched in, and moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts
were drawn up, (as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> march'd along towards
<hi>Armagh</hi>) and being all well clothed and armed, it made the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> a little out of Countenance to ſee it, who were otherwiſe,
which made the Collonel of the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Regiment ſeem
very much concerned, that he ſhould go to Fight againſt ſuch
Scoundrels, as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſeemed to be.</p>
            <p>The General himſelf went that Morning from <hi>Legacory</hi> to ſee the Caſtle of <hi>Charlemont;</hi> and after the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had march'd about half a Mile from it, they drew up in 2 Battalions, about
400 Men in each, and there ſtood till the General came to
ſee them. Old <hi>Teague</hi> was mounted upon an old ſton'd Horſe,
and he very lame with the Scratches, Spavin, Ring-bones,
and other Infirmities; but withal ſo vitious, that he would
fall a kicking, and ſqueeling, if any Body came near him.
<hi>Teague</hi> himſelf had a great Bunch upon his Back, a plain red
Coat, an old weather-beaten Wig hanging down at full
length, a little narrow white Beaver cocked up, a yellow
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:62930:187"/>
Cravat-ſtring, but all of one ſide, his Boots with 1000 Wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
in them; and though it was a very hot Day, yet he had
a great Muff hanging before him, and to Crown all, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
tipſie with Brandy. Thus mounted and equipp'd, he
drew near the Duke with a Complement, but his Horſe would
not allow him to make it a long one, for he fell to work pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ently,
and the Duke had ſcarce time to make him a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
but ſmiled afterwards, and ſaid: <hi>Teague</hi>'s <hi>Horſe was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mad, and himſelf very drunk.</hi> The General then view'd the
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> Battalions, who all, both Officers and Soldiers, after
they had made him a great many Legs, ſtared upon him as
if they knew not whether he was a Man, or ſome other ſtrange
Creature; For the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were generally wont to ask one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>What is that ſham-bear that all this talk is of?</hi> The Duke
ſeeing ſo many Women and Children among them, ask'd the
reaſon of keeping ſuch a Number in the Garriſon, which no
doubt, deſtroy'd their Proviſions; He was anſwered, that
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were naturally very hoſpitable, and that they all
fared alike: But the greateſt reaſon was, the Soldiers would
not ſtay in the Garriſon without their Wives and Miſtreſſes;
The Duke reply'd there was more Love than Policy in it, and
in a little while return'd to the Caſtle; Where my Author
ſays, himſelf ſaw in <hi>Teague</hi>'s own Room, ſeveral Papers, and
among the reſt, a Copy of a Letter writ formerly by ſome
Perſons about King <hi>James,</hi> giving an Account of the State of
the Garriſon, and withall a very true relation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
proceedings in ſeveral things; which was an Argument, they
did not want intelligence. Among others there were two
Prieſts in the Garriſon, and there happened a very pleaſant
Adventure between one of them, and a Dragoon of Collonel
<hi>Heaford</hi>'s Regiment, as they were guarding the <hi>Iriſh</hi> towards
<hi>Armagh:</hi> For falling into Diſcourſe about Religion, at laſt
they fixed upon a Topick, and what ſhould it be but Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.
The Dragoon being a pleaſant, witty Fellow,
drolled upon the Prieſt, and put him ſo to it, that he had
little to ſay for himſelf; upon which he grew ſo angry, that
he ſtruck the Dragoon, who being not uſed tamely to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Blows, it came to a Combat, and he thraſh'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood
very ſeverely: Upon this, complaint being made
to <hi>Teague,</hi> as he ſat at Dinner with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers at
<hi>Armagh;</hi> all that he ſaid was, <hi>That he was very glad on't, What
the Deel had he to do to diſpute Religion with a Dragoon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus matters ſtood in <hi>Ireland</hi> when the King went over,<note place="margin">K. <hi>William</hi> landed in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note>
who landed as you have been told before, at <hi>Carrigfergus,</hi> on
the 14th of <hi>June,</hi> being attended by Prince <hi>George,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

honourable Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> and many other Perſons of Quality, and
went in Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s Coach to <hi>Belfaſt</hi> that Evening;
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:62930:187"/>
and next Day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> Dr. <hi>Royce</hi> preached before him,
on <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Through Faith they ſubdued Kingdoms,</hi> and ſome
days after he went to <hi>Lisburn,</hi> and dined with the General.
The King from thence paſſed to <hi>Hilsburough;</hi> where he ſet
out an Order on the 20th, forbidding the preſſing of Horſes
from the Country People; But finding things did not go on
ſo faſt as he deſired, he expreſt ſome diſſatisfaction, ſaying;
<hi>He did not come there to let Graſs grow under his Feet,</hi> and he
made his words good; For the whole Army now received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to march into the Field, and encamped at a Place called
<hi>Loughbritland,</hi> where the King arrived on the 22d; having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Orders before his coming, for removing the Camp from
the S. ſide to the N. W. of the Town, that he might take a
view of the Regiments as they march'd; and though the
Weather was very dry and windy, and the Duſt exceeding
troubleſome; Yet the King was no ſooner come up, but he
was within the Throng of them, and afterwards view'd every
Regiment very Critically, which pleaſed the Soldiers migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and every one was ready to give all poſſible Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Courage and Duty. From hence they march'd
to <hi>Newry,</hi> and on the 27th to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> where the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<hi>Engliſh, Dutch, Danes, Germans</hi> and <hi>French</hi> joyned, making
in all 36000 Men, as well provided in all reſpects for the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men, as any Kingdom of the World ever had one, and
from whence they marched to <hi>Ardee,</hi> which the Enemy had
abandoned. The King being ever upon Action, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Country as he rid along, ſaid, <hi>It was worth fighting
for;</hi> and on the laſt Day of <hi>June,</hi> underſtanding that all the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Army were paſſed over the <hi>Boyne,</hi> the Night before, he
ordered the whole Army to move in 3 lines toward that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which was about 3 Miles diſtant from them; The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
being near our advanced Guards of Horſe, commanded
by Sir <hi>John Lanier,</hi> made their approaches very regularly,
and by 9 they had got within 2 Miles of <hi>Drogheda.</hi> The King
was in the Front of them, who obſerving there was an Hill
to the E. of the Enemy's Camp; and N. from the Town, he
went thither to view their Camp, which he found to be all
along the River in two lines, and where he had a long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with the Prince, Duke <hi>Scomberg,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
Count <hi>Solms,</hi> Major General <hi>Scravenmoor,</hi> my Lord <hi>Sidney,</hi>
and other great Officers, who were all curious in making their
obſervations upon the Enemy, and <hi>Scravenmoor</hi> ſaid they were
<hi>Vne pettite Armee,</hi> for they could not reckon above 46 Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that lay incamped; but the King anſwered that they
might have a great many Men in the Town, that there was
alſo an Hill to the S. W. beyond which part of their Army
might lie incamped, and that poſſibly they did not ſhew all
their Numbers; however, he ſaid, he was reſolved to ſee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſoon what they were.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:62930:188"/>
From hence the King rid on to the Paſs at the old Bridge,
and ſtood upon the ſide of the Bank, within Musket-ſhot of
the Ford, there to make his further obſervations on the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Poſture and Camp, and in ſome time after rid about
200 Paces up the River, nigh the Weſt of all the Enemy's
Camp. Whilſt his Army was marching in, he alighted, and
ſat him down upon a riſing Ground, where he refreſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for about an hour; during which time ſome of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
with long Guns came down, and ſhot at our Dragoons, who
went down to the River to drink, and ſome of our went down
to return the Complement to the former: And 'twas farther
obſerved, that a Party of about 40 Horſe advancing very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſtood upon a plowed Field over-againſt the King for near
half an Hour, and brought 2 Field-pieces with them, which
they dropt by an Hedge on the ſaid Ground, as was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
known, though our Men did not then diſcover them,
and one of which, when the King was mounted they fired.
It killed 2 Horſes, and a Man about a 100 Yards above where
the King was; which was no ſooner done, but immediately
came a 2d,<note place="margin">K. <hi>William</hi> wounded.</note> which had almoſt been fatal to one of the greateſt
Lives upon Earth; for the Ball having firſt grazed on the
Bank of the River, did in its firſt riſing ſlant upon the King's
Right-ſhoulder, took out a Piece of his Coat, and tore the
Skin and Fleſh, and afterwards broke the Head of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Piſtol. My Lord <hi>Conningsby</hi> no ſooner ſaw his Majeſty
ſtruck, but he rid up and clapt his Handkerchief upon the
Place; but the King himſelf took little notice, and kept on
his pace, ſaying only, <hi>There was no neceſſity the Bullet ſhould
have come nearer,</hi> though the Enemy continued firing, who
when they ſaw their ſhot ſomewhat diſturb our Horſe, they
ſet up a moſt prodigious ſhout all over the Camp, as if the
King's whole Army had been ruin'd, and drew down ſeveral
Squadrons of their Horſe upon a Plain towards the River,
but in ſuch a Place as they knew it was not poſſible for the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> to come at them. Yet when our Guns came up, which
was about 3 that Afternoon, and begun to play, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
their Squadrons into their Camp.</p>
            <p>The King about 9 at Night having called a Council of War, declared he was reſolved to paſs the River next Day, which Duke <hi>Scomberg</hi> at firſt oppoſed; but finding the King
poſitive, he adviſed that part of the Army ſhould be ſent that
Night about 12 towards <hi>Slane-bridge,</hi> and to paſs the River
thereabouts, and ſo get between the Enemy and the Paſs at
<hi>Duleek,</hi> but this Advice was not taken. Then they fell into a
Debate about getting good and truſty Guides, when my
Lord <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> who was by, immediately brought 4
or 5 of his <hi>Iriſh Iniskilling</hi> Officers, who knew the Fords ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:62930:188"/>
well, and took upon them to guide the Army next day;
and here it was concluded how the Army ſhould march, and
who ſhould command at the different Poſts, which were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in this manner. Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas</hi> was to
command the right Wing of Foot, and Count <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Horſe, who were to march on early toward <hi>Slane-bridge,</hi> and
other Fords up the River, to flank the Enemy, or get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Enemy's Camp and <hi>Drogheda,</hi> whilſt in the mean
time a body of Foot forced their way at the Paſs at <hi>Old-bridge.</hi>
But while this was doing on our ſide, the Enemy were not

               </gap>e; for they alſo called a Council of War, wherein Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General <hi>Hambleton,</hi> adviſed to ſend a Party of Dragoons
to a Ford that was below the Town of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> which the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> either knew not of, or elſe did not regard; and all the
reſt being 8 Regiments with their whole left Line towards the
Bridge of <hi>Slane;</hi> but King <hi>James</hi> ſaid, he would ſend 50 Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
up the River, which put <hi>Hamilton</hi> into a great Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
conſidering the Importance of the Place to be defended.
Towards the cloſe of the Evening the Cannon ceaſed on both
ſides, and the King gave Orders that every Soldier ſhould
be provided with a good Stock of Ammunition, and all to
be ready at break of day to march at a minute's Warning,
with every Man a green Bough or Sprig in his Hat, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
him from the Enemy, who wore pieces of Paper on
their Hats, The Word that Night being <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> he rid

               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 1ſt of <hi>July</hi> came, which proved to be a very clear Day, as if the Sun it ſelf had a mind to ſee what the Event would be; when about 6 in the Morning Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General <hi>Douglas</hi> march'd towards the Right with the
Foot, and Count <hi>Scomberg</hi> with the Horſe; which being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by the Enemy, they drew out their Horſe and Foot
towards the left to oppoſe us: The Right Wing at firſt were
ordered to paſs all at <hi>Slane,</hi> but upon better Information, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Regiments were ordered to go over at other Fords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Camp and that place. When the Horſe approach'd
the River, they found a Regiment of the Enemies Dragoons
poſted on the other ſide, who fired upon them, and then
thought to have retreated to their main Body; but before
they could do that, they were flanked in a Lane, and about
70 of their Number ſlain; which was almoſt all the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

and in the mean time, according to my Lord <hi>Portland</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,

the Horſe and Foot were mix'd Squadron with Batallion
for their greater Security. However, more Foot coming up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this Figure was altered, and all the Horſe drawn to the Right,
by which they out-flanked the Enemy conſiderably. They
found the Ground very difficult to paſs by reaſon of a great
Bog, and ſome Ditches that were in the way; but the Horſe
moving to the Right, and the Foot taking the Bog, ſo ſcared
the Enemy, that they retreated in great haſte towards <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leek;</hi>
which was no ſooner obſerved by Count <hi>Scomberg,</hi> but
he fell in among their Foot with his Horſe, and killed a great
many.</p>
            <p>The King, who knew not the diſadvantages of the Ground, but computing the time when he thought his Right Wing might well get over, ordered his Foot to attack the Paſs at
<hi>Old Bridge.</hi> During all this time, a great part of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Army were marching towards <hi>Slane,</hi> and though our
Cannon plaid upon them all the while, yet they kept their
Order. The Blue <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards being to the Right, were
the firſt that took the River at <hi>Old Bridge,</hi> they beat a March
all the while, till they got to the River ſide, and then the
Drums ceaſing, in they went ſome 8 or 10 a-breſt, and found
themſelves almoſt up to the middle preſently in the Stream.
The Enemy who had lined the Houſes, Hedges, and Breaſt
works on the other ſide, did not fire till our Men were got
towards the midſt of the River, and then a whole Peal of
Shot came from all Quarters upon them, yet there was but
one only obſerved to fall. He that was foremoſt was a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eutenant
of Granadiers, who, as he got footing on the other
ſide, drew up 2 Files of Men, and then ſtoop'd, and they
briskly fired over him at the next Hedge, which made the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> quit it; with which the other were diſcouraged, and ſo
all of them left their Poſts, and were followed by a Volley of
Shot from our Men advancing upon them. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Foot
ran ſcattering into the next Field, and before the <hi>Dutch</hi> could

of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe, yet they were quickly beat off again. But by
this time there appeared a great many Battalions and Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of the Enemies all of a ſudden from behind the little
Hills that were there. However, the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſtood ſtoutly to
it, as did alſo 2 <hi>French</hi> Regiments and Colonel <hi>St. Johns,</hi> who

               </gap>s <hi>Hamilton</hi> retreated, a Squadron of
their Horſe charged our <hi>French</hi> ſo bravely, that about 40 of
them broke quite thro' Monſieur <hi>La Calimot</hi>'s Regiment, and
wounded himſelf mortally; But they hapned to over-do their
Work at this time, for being obliged either to go back the
ſame way, or elſe to paſs thro' the Village, and ſo to wheel
to the Left to recover their own Men, they choſe the latter,
but were ſo paid off by ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Inniskilling</hi>
Foot, that not above 6 or 8 of them got beyond the Village,
moſt of their Horſes ſtragling up and down the Fields.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> and the reſt of our Foot advanced all this while, ſo that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Foot quitted a ſecond Hedge they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to rally to, when another Body of Horſe came down
upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who neglected the Hedges, and met them
bravely in the open Field, but kept ſo clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to break them; And as the Enemy came on, begun
to fire by Platoons, and both flanked and fronted them, and
ſo killed a great many of them before they drew off, yet not
without ſome loſs to themſelves. By this time ſome of the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Inniskilliners</hi> were got into the Field, from whence
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had diſturbed our Troops with their Cannon the
Day before, who obliged a freſh Squadron of Horſe that was
coming down upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to retreat with conſiderable
Loſs. All our Horſe went over to the Right and Left, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
one Squadron of <hi>Danes,</hi> who paſſed the River, whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t our
Foot were engaged, and advancing to the Front, <hi>Hambleton</hi>
ſent out 60 Horſe, who charged the <hi>Danes</hi> ſo vigorouſly,
that they retreated much faſter than they went on, ſome of
them never looking behind them, till they had croſſed the
River again: The want of Horſe was ſo apparent in this place,
that the very Countrey People cried out, <hi>Horſe, Horſe,</hi> which
might have proved a fatal Miſtake; for the Word going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Right, and they miſtaking it for <hi>Halt,</hi> ſtopt the
Right Wing for near half an Hour, for that time well ſpent,
might have done great Service. This and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> breaking
thro' the <hi>French</hi> Regiment, hapned much at a time, which
was thought was the Occaſion of the Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s going
over ſo unſeaſonably; For in this Hurry he was killed near
the little Village beyond the River. He received a mortal
Wound thro' his Neck, and was cut in two places over the
Head beſides, and fell down from his Horſe without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one Word; Captain <hi>Foubert</hi> being alſo ſhot in the Arm,
as he was getting him off: Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> likewiſe met with his

above an Hour, that a great many old Soldiers ſaid, <hi>They
never ſaw brisker Work.</hi> But then the Iriſh retreated to a
riſing Ground, and there drew up again in Order, deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gning
to renew the Charge. Whilſt this laſted at the Paſs, the
Left Wing of our Horſe, conſiſting of Danes, Dutch, with
Colonel <hi>Wolſley</hi>'s Horſe and Dragoons, paſſed the River at
a very difficult and unuſual Place, whilſt the Daniſh Foot,
with my Lord <hi>Cuts,</hi> and ſome others went over a little above
them.</p>
            <p>The King, during all theſe Tranſactions, was almoſt every where before the Action began; he rid between his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and theirs with one only Dragoon, and had ordered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing in all other Places as well as might be, before he
paſſed the River, which he did with the Left Wing of Horſe,
and that with as much difficulty as any other whatever: For
his Horſe was bogged on the other ſide, and himſelf forced
to alight, till a Gentleman helped him to get his Horſe out.
But as ſoon as the Men were got upon the other Bank, and
put into order, he drew his Sword, which yet was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to him, his Arm being ſtiff with the Wound he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
before, and march'd at the Head of them towards the
Enemy, who were coming on again in good order upon our
Foot that had now got over the Paſs, and were advancing brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
towards the Iriſh, tho' they were double their Number.
But when the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e 2. Bodies had got almoſt within Musket-ſhot of
one another, the Enemy eſpy'd the Left Wing of our Horſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
towards them, at which they made a ſudden halt, faced
about, and retreated up the Hill again to a little Village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Dunmore,</hi> about half a Mile from the Paſs. Our Men
marching in good order, came up with them at this Village,
when the Iriſh faced abont, and charged with ſo much brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that our Horſe was forced to give ground, tho' the
King was with them. Hereupon the King rid to the <hi>Iniskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingers,</hi>
and asked what they would do for him; and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
before them: Their Officer telling his Men who it was,
and what Honour was done them. At the Head of theſe
Men, the King received the Enemies Fire, and then wheeling
to the left, that his own Men might have liberty to advance
and fire, they erroneouſly retired after him above a 100
Yards; which made the King move to the Left to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at the Head of ſome Dutch Troops that were advancing,
while in the mean time the <hi>Iniskillingers</hi> growing ſenſible of
their Miſtake, went on again to the Charge, and did good
Service. Some of Duke <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>homberg</hi>'s Horſe were here alſo,
and behaved themſelves well, taking one or two of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Standards, while another Party commanded by Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General <hi>Cinkle,</hi> now the Renowned Earl of <hi>Athlone,</hi>
charge in a Lane to the Left; but the Iriſh proved too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:62930:190"/>
for them there, and ſo they were obliged to retreat.
This being obſerved by a Party of Sir <hi>Albert Cunningham</hi>'s
Dragoons, and another of Colonel <hi>Leviſon</hi>'s, the Officers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Men to alight, and line an Hedge, as alſo an old
Houſe that flanked the Lane, from whence they poured in
their Shot upon the Enemy. Lieutenant General <hi>Ginkle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the Rear of his Men, being heartily vexed at their
retreating, and was in ſome Danger by our own Dragoons;
For the Enemy being cloſe upon him, they could not well
diſtinguiſh. However, the Dragoons did a piece of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Service in this Place, by ſtopping the Enemy, who came
up very boldly; and our Horſe having the Opportunity of
Rallying here, as they did to the Right, the Enemy after
near half an hours ſharp Diſpute, were bear back again from
this place, and a great many of them killed. On the other
ſide, Lieutenant General <hi>Hambleton</hi> finding that his Foot did
not anſwer his Expectation, he put himſelf at the Head of
the Horſe, which being defeated by ours, he was wounded
on the Head, and taken Priſoner. When he was brought to
the King, he was pleaſed to ask him, Whether the Iriſh
would fight any more? <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>an't <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon my Honour I believe they will; for they have a good Body of
Horſe ſtill.</hi> When he named his <hi>Honour,</hi> the King looked a
little aſide at him, and repeated once or twice, <hi>Your Honour;</hi>
intimating, That what he aſſumed upon his Honour, was not
to be believed, ſince he had forfeited that before, by ſiding
with the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnell;</hi> And this was all the Rebuke he
gave him for his breach of Truſt.</p>
            <p>Now you are to underſtand, that while all this happened on this ſide, our Men on the Right were making the beſt of their way over the Hedges and Bogs towards <hi>Duleek;</hi> and
as they advanced, the Enemy drew off till they had heard
what had happened at the Paſs, and then they mended
their pace, yet they could not make ſo much haſte,
but that ſeveral of them were killed, eſpecially among the
Foot, upon whom a Party of our Horſe broke in, but
they preſently ſcattered among the Corn and Hedges, till
they got beyond a great Ditch, which our Horſe could not
paſs. But tho' when they got over the Paſs, they drew up,
and fired their great Guns upon our Men, who did the like
on their ſide, as being not able eaſily to come at them with
their ſmall Shot; yet their Confuſion was ſo great, that they
left a great many Arms, with a Quantity of Ammunition in
the Village of <hi>Duleek,</hi> and indeed all the Country over: Yet
our Men were ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>illy as to blow up the Powder where-ever
they found it, and few or none of the Enemy eſcaped, that fell
into their Hands; for they ſhot them like Hares among the
Corn, and in the Hedges, as they found them on their March.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:62930:191"/>
Of all the Iriſh Commanders, none ſeemed to have been
more active and vigilant, and done better Service that day,
than Lieutenant General <hi>Hambleton,</hi>

which he had with him, and which were the beſt Men in the
late King's Army, no way derogated from the good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which was generally conceived of their Valour, but ſtood
to it, till they ſaw themſelves abandoned by the other, and
then retreated in very good order: But the Iriſh made ſo
much haſte, that tho' our Foot purſued them above 4 Miles
beyond the place of Battel, yet they could not overtake them,
no more than ſome of the Horſe who continued the Purſuit
till Night, and then returned to the place where the Foot
made an Halt, and where they remained at their Arms all
Night.</p>
            <p>The Enemies whole Loſs in this Battel, was generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted at 1500 Men, and of them ſome conſiderable Perſons, as the Lord <hi>Dungan,</hi> the Lord <hi>Carling ford,</hi> and Sir <hi>Neal O Neal,</hi>
&amp;c. But one thing was obſervable that day, that moſt of
their Horſemen who charged ſo deſperately, were drunk
with Brandy, each Man having that Morning received half a
Pint to his Share: But it's like the Foot had not ſo large a
Proportion, or at leaſt did not deſerve it ſo well. And on

called a brave Man, and a great General: He was certainly
a Perſon of the beſt Education in the World, and knew Men
and Things beyond moſt of his Time, appearing courteous
and civil to all, and yet had ſomething always that looked
ſo great in him, that commanded Reſpect from Men of all
Stations and Qualities. As to his Perſon, he was of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Stature, Fair-complexion'd, a very ſound, hardy Man of
his Age, and ſat an Horſe incomparably well; and as he loved
always to be neat in his Cloaths, ſo was he ever pleaſant in
his Converſation, and tho' he was 82 Years old when he
died; yet when he came to be embowelled, his Heart, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails

raiſing the Siege, eſpecially ſince he had but very little Bread
all the while; and that there was ſome Reaſon to believe the

So that there were Orders given to be ready to march at
12 that Night when the Baggage was ſent away, and at break
of day, the 25th, the Army followed, having loſt about 30

Action of the King's, yet it had ſo good an Effect upon that
part of the Army, that the Country was ſecured from any
Violence done by the Soldiers during that whole March to

went very near the Town, and drove in a Party of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Horſe, who made a ſhew of oppoſing them. On the
9th, the whole Army made its approach in excellent Order:
For no ſooner had the Pioneers cut the Hedges that were in
the way, but the Men advanced, which made the Enemy
draw backwards, till they came to a narrow Paſs between
a Bogs, within half a Mile of the Town, which was not above
150 Yards, and this full of Hedges and other Incumbrances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Herein, however, there were Lanes that led to the Town,
the middlemoſt being the broadeſt, where ſtood the Iriſh
Horſe; To the right and left of which the Hedges were lined
all with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſqueteers, of whom the Engliſh Foot were now
got within leſs than 200 Yards. The detacht Party of Foot
was upon the Advance towards the Center; The Horſe a
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:62930:193"/>
little to the right of them, the Danes to the left; And the blew
Dutch, with ſeveral Engliſh Regiments upon the right; And
all this in ſuch Decorum, that though the Hedges were very
thick and troubleſome, yet the Front kept all in a Line except
the advanced Party, who went always ſome diſtance before:
Whilſt theſe things were going on thus, the King ordered 2
Field-pieces to be planted towards the left, where they could
bear upon the Enemy's Horſe, and fired from thence with ſo
good Succeſs, that the Enemy ſoon quitted that Poſt. And it
is very remarkable, our Engliſh Foot were ſo little concerned,
that tho' they knew the Enemy to be in the next Hedges; yet
whilſt the Pioneers were at work they would ſit down, and
ask one another, whether they thought they ſhould have any
Bread that day (for they began to want their Breakfaſts, tho'
ſome few of them went into the other World for it) while the
Danes to the left ſtood with all the Care, and Circumſpection
in the World, and ſome of them obſerving the Poſture of our
Men, and hearing what they ſaid, they thought they had no
mind to fight; But they were quickly convinced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
for the Hedges were no ſooner down, and one Front
advancing in a narrow Field, and that the Iriſh fired a whole
Volley upon them from the neighbouring Hedges, but ſome
of the Engliſh cried out aloud, <hi>Ah, you Toads, are you there?
We will be with you preſently;</hi> and ſo they ran without any
more ado along the Field, directly towards the Hedges where
the Iriſh were planted, who thereupon quitted one Hedge
after another; So as that the Danes advancing on the left, and
the blew Dutch with the Engliſh on the right, and the Horſe
coming on in the Center; the Iriſh in leſs than half an hour
after the Volley, were driven under their very Walls, and
not a dozen Men loſt on our ſide in all the Action; which if
the Iriſh had managed their buſineſs well, would have coſt us
a great many more. But as ſoon as they got under their
Walls, they plyed our Forces with their great Guns, that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſeveral as they marched in, which the whole Army did
before 5 in the Afternoon, and moſt of them incamp'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

encamped to the left, where they found an old, Fort built by
their Anceſtors, which they were very proud of and from
thence they fired 3 or 4 Field-pieces upon the Iriſh that lay
intrenched between them and the Town.</p>

ſerviceable to them; But not ſo much a diſadvantage to us,
as the ſurprizing of the Train, that was upon the Road to join
the Army.</p>
            <p>It was reported,<note place="margin">The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Train ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
               </note> a French-man and one of the Gunners ran away, the Day before, from the Army, and got into <hi>Limerick,</hi>
and gave the Enemy an account where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Train lay;
as alſo of thoſe Guns, and other things, that were coming up,
where the King's Tent ſtood, and divers other things that
might be material for them to know, and therefore they plaid
very briskly upon the Train, as alſo towards the King's Tent,
which he was prevailed with at laſt to remove, but this was not
all: For though on <hi>Munday,</hi> one <hi>Manus O Brian,</hi> a ſubſtantial
Country Gentleman came to the Camp, and gave notice that
<hi>Sarsfield</hi> with a Body of Horſe had paſſed the River in the
Night, and deſigned ſomething extraordinary; yet he was
ſo far from being taken notice of at firſt, that moſt People
looked upon what he ſaid as a Dream, and though a great
Officer called him aſide, as though he deſigned to have ſome
more particular information; yet his main buſineſs was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate
him concerning a Prey of Cattle in ſuch a Place,
which the Gentleman complained of afterward, ſaying, <hi>He
was ſorry to ſee General Officers mind Cattle more than the King's
Honour.</hi> But after he had met with ſome acquaintance, he
was brought to the King; who to prevent the worſt gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that 500 Horſe-ſhould be made ready, and march to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:62930:194"/>
meet the Guns; But where-ever the fault lay, it was certainly
1 or 2 in the Morning before the Party marched; which they
did very ſoftly, till after they ſaw a great light in the Air, and
heard a ſtrange rumbling Noiſe, which ſome conjectured to
be the Train blown up, as it really was: For our Train having
on <hi>Munday</hi> marched beyond <hi>Cullen,</hi> to a little old ruinous Caſtle
called <hi>Ballenedy,</hi> not 7 Miles from the Camp: <hi>Sarsfield</hi> lurked
all that day in the Mountains; and having notice; where and
how our Men lay, he had thoſe that guided him through By-ways
to the very ſpot, where he fell in among them, before
they were aware, and cut ſeveral of them to pieces, with a
great many of the Waggoners, and ſome Country People that
were carrying Proviſions to the Camp.</p>
            <p>The Officer commanding in chief, when he ſaw how it was, commanded to ſound to Horſe, but thoſe that endeavoured to fetch them up, were killed as they went out, or elſe ſaw it was
too late to return: The Officers and others made what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
they could, but they were every Man at length obliged
to ſhift for themſelves; ſo that, there were in all about 60
Perſons killed; but it did not end here: For the <hi>Iriſh</hi> got up
what Horſes they could meet withall, belonging either to the
Troops or Train, ſome broke the Boats, and others drew all
the Carriages, and Waggons, with the Bread, Ammunition,
and as many of the Guns, as they could get in ſo ſhort a time
into one heap, they filled the Guns with Powder, and put their
Mouths into the Ground, that they might thereby certainly
ſplit. What they could pick up in an hurry they took away
with them, and then laid a Train to the reſt, which being
fired at their going off, blew up all with an aſtoniſhing Noiſe,
but for all that 2 of the Guns received no damage: The <hi>Iriſh</hi>
took no Priſoners on this occaſion, only a Lieutenant of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Earl</hi>'s being ſick in a Houſe hard-by, was ſtript and brought
to <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> who uſed him very civilly, and told him, if he
had not ſucceeded in that Enterprize, he would have gone for
<hi>France.</hi> The party of Horſe that was ſent from the Camp,
came up after the buſineſs was over in ſight of the Enemy's
Rear; But wheeling towards the left, to endeavour to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Enemy's Paſſage over the <hi>Shannon,</hi> they unhappily
went another way. The News of this Adventure was very
unwelcome in the Camp, and even the very private Men
ſhewed their concern at it; However the Siege went on, and
the Trenches were opened the 17th, and a Battery raiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Fort, to the Right of the Trenches, which diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome of the Enemy's Cannon, and the day following his
Majeſty himſelf was in great danger: For while the Enemy
fired very thick, he rid ſoftly up towards <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Port, and
as his Horſe was directly entring the Gap, he was ſtaid by a
Gentleman who came to ſpeak to him, when in the ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

there ſtruck a 24 Pounder in the very Place, which
would have ſtruck the King and his Horſe too, to pieces, if
his uſual good Angel had not defended him: It ſtruck the
Duſt all about him however, though he took little notice of
it, but alighting came and laid himſelf down on the Fort
among all the Duſt. It will be an endleſs thing to trace eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular of the Attacks and Defences; and therefore
I ſhall only obſerve that on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 27th of <hi>Aug.</hi>
after a Breach had been made nigh St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gate, over the
black Battery of about 12 Yards in length, and pretty flat;
The King gave order that the Counterſcarp ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt
that Afternoon; and had it not been for one Errour,
which yet could not well be avoided, the place had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
carried: However to ſhew you the bravery of our
Men upon this occaſion, we will give you a few particulars.
About half an Hour after 3 the ſignal being given by firing
3 Pieces of Cannon, and the Granadeers ſtanding in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt
Angle of the Trenches, they leapt over, and ran
toward the Counterſcarp, firing their Pieces, and throwing
in their Granadoes, which gave the <hi>Iriſh</hi> the Allarm, who
had all their Guns ready, and diſcharged great and ſmall Shot
upon them as faſt as poſſible, who were not behind with them
in either; ſo that in leſs than 2 Minutes there was ſuch a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Noiſe, that you would have thought the Skies ready to
rent in ſunder: Captain <hi>Carlile</hi> of my Lord <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ran on with his Granadeers to the Counterſcarp; and
though he was wounded twice, between that and the Trenches,
yet he went bravely on, and commanded his Men to throw in
their Granadoes; but leaping into the dry Ditch under the
Counterſcarp, an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Man below ſhot him dead: However
the Lieutenant encouraged the Men, and they boldly mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Counterſcarp, and all the reſt of the Granadeers were
as ready as they, which ſo daunted the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that they began
to throw down their Arms, and ran as faſt as they could into
the Town; our Men perceiving this, entred the Breach with
them pell-mell, and above half the Earl of <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers
with ſome others were actually within that Place, and
they had certainly carried it, had not the Regiments that
were to ſecond the Granadeers upon the Counterſcarp ſtopt
there, as having no orders to go any farther: For the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
were all running from the Walls quite over the Bridge into
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Town, but ſeeing there were but a few of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
that entred, they were with much a-do perſwaded to rally;
And thoſe that were in, finding themſelves not ſeconded, and
their Ammunition ſpent, thought of nothing now but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat;
But ſome were ſhot, others taken, and very few of
the reſt who came out again, but were wounded, which ſo
ela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed the Spirits of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that they ventured upon the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:62930:195"/>
Breach again, and from the Walls, and every other where did
ſo peſter our Men upon the Counterſcarp; that after nigh 3
Hours reſiſting. Bullets, Stones, broken Bottles (from the
very Women who daringly ſtood on the Breach, and were
nearer our Men than their own) and whatever elſe could be
thought on to deſtroy, it was at laſt thought ſafeſt to return
to the Trenches. But this was not our only Loſs, for while
this Work was at the hotteſt, a <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Regiment, who
behaved themſelves very well, being got upon the Black-Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
the Enemies Powder happened to take fire, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
blew up a great many of them, the Men, Faggots,
Stones, and what not, flying into the Air with a moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Noiſe; and tho' my Lord <hi>Cuts,</hi> who was commanded by
the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> to march towards the Spur at the
S, Gate, beat in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that appeared on that ſide, yet he
loſt ſeveral of his Men, and was himſelf wounded; For he
adventurouſly approaching within half Musket-ſhot of the
Gate, all his Men lay open to the Enemies Shot, who lay ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
within the Spur and the Walls. The <hi>Danes</hi> demeaned
themſelves alſo gallantly at their Poſt; but the miſchief on't
was, there was but one Breach. The Action was very brisk
every where, and there was one continued fire both of great
and ſmall Shot, from half an hour after 3 till 7, inſomuch
that the Smoke which went from the Town, reached in one

The Apprehenſions of the Diſaſter that befel us from the
<hi>French</hi> Fleet, was no ſooner over, but the Queen ſet all hands
on work, and in a very ſhort time fitted up ſuch a Fleet of
Men of War, that the Enemy were ſo far from looking it in

Conditions that were propoſed, the Cannon began to play
again very furiouſly, and made a conſiderable Breach; and
when any of the Enemy appeared on the Wall near it, they
were raſed off by the ſmall Ordnance from the Cat; And leſt
the Enemy might make their Eſcape thro' the Marſh, there
were 40 Men placed the Night before in the <hi>Brick-Yard,</hi> near

and next day reach'd the Town of <hi>Kingsale</hi> then in
Poſſeſſion of his own Men, who quenched the Fire, and that
Evening poſted his Troops toward the New Fort, as Major-General
<hi>Tettau</hi> with 800 Men next Morning early paſſed the
River in Boats, and ſtormed the Fort with very good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs:
For ſeveral Barrels of Powder at the ſame time acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
taking fire, blew up nigh 40 of the Enemy; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the reſt flying into an old Caſtle in the midſt of the
Fort, were a great many of them killed before they could
get thither, and all that made reſiſtance, as the Engliſh
ſcaled the Walls, were cut to pieces; ſo that of 450 Men
in the Fort, about 200 were blown up and killed, and the
reſt ſubmitting to Mercy, were made Priſoners. My Lord
having gained the Old Fort, reſolved to make as quick Work
as he could with the new one, which was far the more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
of the two; For the Weather was now grown very
bad, and Proviſions ſcarce, and, withal, the Men began to
be ſickly, which made him judge it the beſt way to attack
the Place briskly. However, he ſent the Governour a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to ſurrender; who returned anſwer, <hi>It would be time
enough to talk of that a Month hence.</hi> Whereupon the Cannon
being planted, they began to batter the Place two ways,
and upon the 9th day of the Month, the Men got near the
Counterſcarp, on the 12th in the Morning 6 Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
were mounted at the <hi>Danes</hi> Attack which was to the
Left, and 2 Mortars at the Engliſh, which fired all Day,
and the Mortars continued all Night; and more Guns were
planted on the Engliſh Battery the two ſucceeding Days;
for the <hi>Danes</hi> on their ſide had made a pretty large Breach:
Then they ſprung a Mine with very good Succeſs, and were
preparing for another. Being now become Maſters of the
Counterſcarp, the Cannon plaid the 15th all the Morning
long, and every thing was now ready to lay the Galleries
over the Ditch,<note place="margin">Surrendred.</note> when the Enemy beat a Parley about ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring
the Fort; which being done, the Articles were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to and ſigned: By them the middle Baſtion was to be
delivered up next Morning, and the Garriſon being above
1200 Men to march out the day after with their Arms and
Baggage, and to be conducted to <hi>Limerick.</hi> There were
about 200 Men killed and wounded in the ſeveral Attacks
our Men made, but there were ſome Amends made to the
Survivors, at leaſt ſome of them; For beſides a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Magazine, there was great Plenty of all kinds of
Proviſions in the Fort, and good Liquor of all ſorts. With
this ſucceſsful Expedition we ſhall end the Affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi>
for this Year, there being no other Action of conſiderable
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:62930:197"/>
Moment performed there; but only obſerve that all <hi>Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
was reduced under the King's Obedience by taking of
theſe two Towns, which was no ſmall Advantage to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
conſidering that Province is the moſt Southern of all
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and conſequently the neareſt to <hi>France;</hi> and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo, but as it has the moſt convenient Ports in all that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and perhaps in the World, ſo there the <hi>French</hi> King
generally landed all his Supplies for that Countrey; and
was therefore afterwards forced to fetch a great Compaſs to do
it, which did not a little impede his Affairs. And now we are
at leiſure to look a little how things have gone on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
            <p>How conſiderable ſoever the weight of the Confederacy ſeemed already to be,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the manner of it.</note> it was this year further augmented by the Addition of another Prince, who, tho' he were in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as light as a Feather, yet the Situation of his Country
was ſuch, as to make both Parties court him with utmoſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
tho' in a different manner, and with different Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had all along ſince the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the War, profeſs'd to ſtand Neutral, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
did not very well pleaſe neither Party concern'd in it;
tho' the French, who, one ſhould think, had moſt reaſon to
be content of any, firſt appear'd to be moſt diſſatisfied: For
not pleas'd to have before put the Duke upon Impriſoning,
Exiling and deſtroying his Proteſtant Subjects, the poor <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi>
they declare themſelves now not ſatisfied with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Neutrality, which was no other than a meer <hi>Chimera,</hi>
and therefore demanded he ſhould put the Cittadels of <hi>Verceil</hi>
and <hi>Turin</hi> into their Hands for the Security of his Word,
which were hard Lines. However, the Duke put as good a
meen upon the matter as he could, and ſome time was ſpent,
if not gained by the Duke, in ſending of Couriers to the
King upon the Subject, and receiving others from him; which
tho' it did for a while, yet a new Accident happened that
made the French much more preſſing and peremptory for a
poſitive Anſwer: For being inform'd that the Emperor had
at laſt granted what the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had ſo long deſired;
that is to ſay, to be acknowledged King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and to be
addreſs'd to under the Title of <hi>His Royal H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ghneſs,</hi> which the
Emperor had formerly refuſed, upon good Conſiderations of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him by the Duke, they became ſomewhat more than
ſuſpicious of the Duke's Fidelity; and his declaring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
to the French King by his Miniſter. That he had no
deſign to abandon the Friendſhip of <hi>France,</hi> or to do any
thing contrary to the Treaties that were between that Crown
and him, were look'd upon as Terms ſo general, and of ſo
comprehenſive a Latitute, that they would not paſs for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Coin in the French Court: Wherefore Mounſieur <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:62930:198"/>
who was to Command the French Troops on that ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
did, before Summer was well begun, paſs the Mountains,
and arrived at <hi>Turin,</hi> leaving an Army of about 18000 Men
to rendezvous in the <hi>Dauphinate,</hi> and ſo to follow him into
the Duke's Territories; which they ſoon did, and for a time
demeaned themſelves without committing any Hoſtility.
For the Duke himſelf did not only offer to obſerve an exact
Neutrality, and for Security of Performance, to furniſh the
King with 2000 Foot, and a 1000 Horſe; But the Pope's
Nuncio at <hi>Turin</hi> alſo thruſt himſelf in to Patch up the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
tho' without being able to find any <hi>Medium:</hi> For
<hi>Catinat</hi> not ſatisfied with any Offers that were made, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
demanded <hi>Verceil</hi> for a place of Arms, proteſting that
he could not liſten to any Accord, but upon thoſe Conditions.
And the Duke had as little reaſon to be pleaſed with him or
his Maſter, upon this Head: But tho' it is manifeſt he had
by this time made Choice of his ſide, yet all the Artifice ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
was uſed to ſpin out a little more time, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he would very much endanger his Country, ſince the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> from the <hi>Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>neſe</hi> were not in a Condition to ſuccour
him; And this was attended with new Propoſitions, from
<hi>France,</hi> which in ſubſtance contained, That the King was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to refer his Concerns to the Pope and Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi>
upon Condition the Duke would put <hi>Verceil, Carmagnole,</hi> and
<hi>Suza</hi> into the Pope's Hands, till the End of the War. But the
Duke being no longer willing to mince a Matter that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
but too much ſuſpected, and muſt neceſſarily be known,
declared, That he had now made Choice of his Party; and
that he was engaged with the Emperor, and could not go
from his Word. However, in regard the Alliance which he
had made with his Imperial Majeſty, tended no further than
to oppoſe the unjuſt Deſigns of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,
to defend himſelf from Oppreſſion, and ſecure the Repoſe of
all <hi>Italy;</hi> If his Majeſty would put <hi>Cazal</hi> and <hi>Pignerol</hi> into the
Hands of the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> till the End of the War,
and that all Differences between them were decided, he
would lay down his Arms, and for ſome time put into the
Pope's Hands one of his Towns, as a Pledge for the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Word. But <hi>France,</hi> neither abſolutely, nor for
any time had a mind to hearken to ſuch Conditions, and ſo
came to an open Rupture; the Conſequence whereof, was the
immediate Liberty of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and Incouragement to arm
themſelves againſt <hi>France,</hi> the publick avowing of the Duke's
Treaties firſt with the Emperor, and afterward with <hi>Spain;</hi>
each of which we ſhall give you the Particulars of, partly as

               <p>2. That the Emperor ſhall take ſuch Order, that the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> ſhall employ all the Forces of that State, for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Royal Highneſs's Territories, and that the Spaniſh
Fleet ſhall take care to ſecure the City and Country of <hi>Nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That his Imperial Majeſty ſhall forthwith ſend 6000 of his choiceſt Men to join his Highneſs's Forces; which his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty engages to pay without their pretending to any Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That his Imperial Majeſty ſhall endeavour to the utmoſt of his Power, that the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> the French Exiles, and the 8000
Men, which the Marqueſs of <hi>Rorgomainero,</hi> Ambaſſadour of
<hi>Spain,</hi> has promiſed ſhall be ſent into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> ſhall altogether
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:62930:199"/>
join the Troops of his Royal Highneſs; the Emperor leaving to him
the Care of Employing all thoſe Forces jointly with the Governour
of <hi>Milan,</hi> as they ſhall find moſt convenient.</p>
               <p>5. That the Emperor and the Confederates ſhall endeavour the Reſtauration of <hi>Pignerol</hi> into the Hands of his Royal Highneſs, either by Force of Arms, or by a Treaty, without laying any
claim to <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which his Imperial Majeſty renounces, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Ancient Treaties.</p>
               <p>6. Laſtly, His Imperial Majeſty ſhall lay no claim to any thing that may happen to be won from <hi>France,</hi> on that ſide, but leaves his Royal Highneſs, and the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> to agree that
Point together.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Imperial Troops, in purſuance to this Treaty, were ordered forthwith to march into <hi>Italy,</hi> but they met with many Difficulties in their Paſſages; however, we ſhall hear
more of them hereafter, and think it more proper in this
Place to give you the other Articles with <hi>Spain,</hi> for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
above-mentioned, and they were theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>IN regard there is a French Army come into <hi>Italy,</hi> with a Deſign to act openly againſt the State of <hi>Milan;</hi> and for that the ſaid Army is quartered in the Territories of his
Royal Highneſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> in revenge of the Affection which
he bears to his Imperial Majeſty, and to conſtrain the ſaid
Duke to ſurrender into the Hands of the King of <hi>France</hi> two
of his ſtrongeſt Garriſons, and a part of his Forces, that the
ſaid King may be the better in a Condition to invade <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>

the Count of <hi>Fuenſalida,</hi> in the Name of the King

Majeſty King <hi>William,</hi> the <hi>States-General,</hi> and all his other

                        <p>2. That there ſhall neither Peace, nor Truce be made, unleſs what may have been Conquer'd or Vſurp'd by the Enemy, within the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> or the Territories of <hi>Savoy,</hi> either by open

                        <p>3. Both Parties mutually oblige themſelves to aſſiſt each other with the Forces they already have, or may have, for the Defence of the Territories of his Royal Highneſs, as if it were the Defence
of each one's proper Right.</p>
                        <p>4. For the Execution of what is above concluded, the Count of <hi>Fuenſalida</hi> ſhall cauſe his Army to march forthwith, conſiſting of 8000 Horſe, and between 8 and 9000 Foot, during this preſent
War; which Army ſhall enter <hi>Piemont,</hi> by the way of <hi>Verceil,</hi>
under the Count of <hi>Lovignie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>5. That the ſaid Army ſhall have 12 Pieces of Cannon, with all neceſſary Ammunition, at the Expence of his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                        <p>6. That ſo ſoon as the Army ſhall be encamp'd under the Cannon of <hi>Verceil,</hi> his Royal Highneſs ſhall join it with 4 Regiments of Infantry, and 2 of Dragoons.</p>
                        <p>7. When the Forces are joined, they ſhall march towards <hi>Turin,</hi>

Alſo two more Regiments of Foot, and 400 Horſe

Friends, they ſhall be ſtill ready where Action calls them, and his
Royal Highneſs ſhall think fit to command them.</p>
                        <p>8. In caſe <hi>Turin,</hi> or any other Garriſon of his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall happen to be beſieged, taken, or blocked up, the Army of his Majeſty ſhall be obliged to relieve it, in conjunction with his
Royal Highneſs.</p>
                        <p>9. In caſe the Enemy ſhall march to meet our Army, his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highneſs ſhall cauſe his Troops to march either to join the ſaid Army, if it be poſſible, or elſe to Attack the Enemy's
Rear.</p>
                        <p>10. If the Enemy's Army ſhall march towards the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> his Royal Highneſs ſhall forthwith ſend away his Troops to join the Army of the Allies, and jointly to Attack the Enemy,
for the Defence of the State of <hi>Milan;</hi> the ſaid Troops being

than <hi>Verceil,</hi> and that there ſhall be need of more Waggons
for Munitions and Proviſions, his Royal Highneſs ſhall furniſh
the Army with ready Money at a reaſonable Price, and the

12. And for the better furniſhing his Catholick Majeſty's Army
in <hi>Piemont</hi> with Bread, his Excellency ſhall cauſe Meal and Wheat
to be carried to <hi>Verceil;</hi> and if by reaſon of the Enemy, or any
other Accident, the Corn cannot be carried to the Place where his
Catholick Majeſty's Army lies; his Royal Highneſs ſhall furniſh
him, and ſhall be re-imburſed his Charges; and that Mony ſhall be
allowed to the Troops of his Royal Highneſs, coming into the State
of <hi>Milan,</hi> if they cannot be furniſhed with Corn, as has been
ſaid.</p>
                        <p>13. The ſame thing ſhall be obſerved in reference to the Warlike Ammunition, for the Service of the Troops, while the Artillery ſhall be at the Charges of his Catholick Majeſty.</p>
                        <p>14. Forage, or the uſe of Hay and Graſs in the Field, ſhall be taken indifferently on both ſides, in the place where the Forces of his Catholick Majeſty, and his Royal Highneſs ſhall be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
both ſubmitting to Military Diſcipline, without committing
any Diſorders; And both Allies ſhall give Orders to their Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allers
to repair to the Army, and ſell their Proviſions at a moderate
Price.</p>
                        <p>15. And becauſe the preſent Alliance is only defenſive, 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That when the Army of <hi>France</hi> ſhall begin to commit Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility, either in the Territories of <hi>Milan,</hi> or thoſe of his Royal
Highneſs, it ſhall be then changed into an Offenſive Alliance. And
in caſe that <hi>Pignerol</hi> and <hi>Caſal</hi> ſhall be taken from the <hi>French,</hi>
the firſt ſhall be remitted into the Hands of his Royal Highneſs, the
other ſhall belong to his Catholick Majeſty by Right of Conqueſt, yet
ſo as no way to prejudice the Right and Poſſeſſion which his Royal
Highneſs has taken of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> by Vertue of the Treaty of <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſco.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in caſe there ſhall be any thing won from the Enemy in any Place, where his Royal Highneſs has any particular Right, it ſhall be parted in Halves, by reaſon of the great Damages which his
Royal Highneſs ſuffers from the Enemies Army that lies in his
Countrey, having put off the March which they had deſigned, to
make an Invaſion into <hi>Milan,</hi> to which the Territories of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſerves as a Bulwark, being nevertheleſs burthen'd by an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible
Charge of the <hi>French</hi> Army. And in regard the Count of
<hi>Fuenſalida</hi> takes Charge of his Catholick Majeſties Army, which is
kept in Pay for the Delivery and Defence of <hi>Milan,</hi> he is alſo oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to aſſign Winter-Quarters in the Territories of <hi>Milan,</hi> to the
Troops of his Royal Highneſs, and to put them into ſuch a Condition,
that they may be fit for Service the next Campaign. The Manner and
Form being concerted between his Royal Highneſs and his Eminence
in Perſon, or between their Miniſters, as alſo the Number of well-diſciplined
Men; his Excellency having all the while Power to
agree for Money for the Winter-Quarters, except Forage.</p>

            <p>I ſhall not now enter upon the particular Conſequences of theſe Alliances, as having ſome things nearer home firſt to obſerve: And here I cannot but note, That as the Enemies
of <hi>France</hi> increaſed, ſo ſhe ſeemed equally, or rather more to
increaſe in Power, being very formidable this Year by Sea,
of which we have already inſtanced the Particulars, and no
whitinferior by Land, as will manifeſtly appear in the Courſe
of this Diſcourſe, and of which the Confederates eſpecially
on <hi>Flanders</hi> and the Lower <hi>Rhine</hi>-ſide ſeemed to be ſenſible:
And therefore they concerted their matters thus, That the
Army of the States ſhould oppoſe in <hi>Flanders</hi> that of <hi>France</hi>
commanded by the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </note> while the Elector of
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> ſhould upon the Banks of the <hi>Moſelle</hi> withſtand the
Forces commanded by the Marqueſs <hi>de Boufflers.</hi> But the
<hi>French,</hi> according to their uſual forwardneſs, having taken the
Field betimes, the States Troops were conſtrain'd to draw
out of their Garriſons to attend the Enemy, before thoſe of
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> were come to the Poſts aſſigned them, which gave
<hi>Boufflers</hi> an opportunity to encamp between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> from whence he could joyn the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>
whenever there was occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Generals; under theſe Circumſtances, were obliged to encamp at the <hi>Pieton,</hi> the moſt advantageous Poſt of all <hi>Flanders,</hi> and there to ſtay till the <hi>Brandenburg</hi>-Army
took the Field, and thereby cauſe the Enemy to divide their
Forces. But while they lay at <hi>Pieton,</hi> they underſtood that
the Duke of <hi>Luxemberg</hi> drew near the <hi>Sambre,</hi> with a Deſign
to croſs that River between <hi>Namur</hi> and <hi>Charleroy,</hi> in order to
waſte the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Countries, and put them under Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Which News ſo allarm'd the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that tho' they
could do little of themſelves, yet they preſſed the <hi>Dutch</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
to oppoſe the <hi>French</hi> Intentions; wherein they the
more eaſily prevailed, ſince Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> was of himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to it, out of the Conſideration he had of what Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it was to keep the <hi>French</hi> beyond the <hi>Sambre;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he decamped from the <hi>Pieton June</hi> 3d, N. S. and detatch'd
the Count of <hi>Berlo</hi> the ſame day with a Detachment of 1500
Horſe, to obſerve whether the Enemy endeavour'd to paſs the
<hi>Sambre,</hi> or no, who was followed by the Count of <hi>Flodorp</hi> with
4 or 5 Regiments of Cavalry, to aſſiſt him, or make good his
Retreat; the Count of <hi>Webennum</hi> being alſo poſted on this
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:62930:201"/>
ſide a narrow Lane which was to be paſſed thro' before they
could come at the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Berlo</hi> being advanced as far as the Village of <hi>Fleuri,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Flerus.</hi>
               </note> found that a good part of the <hi>French</hi> Army had already paſſed the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and poſted themſelves againſt the Village which they
kept to their Backs; of all which Prince <hi>Waldeck,</hi> who was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
between <hi>Mellin</hi> and <hi>Fleuri,</hi> was inſtantly informed. Now
the Enemy having notice of <hi>Berlo</hi>'s Approach, marched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
towards him, while the Duke of <hi>Luxemberg</hi> preſently
diſpatch'd away ſeveral Troops privately thro' By-ways, to fall
upon him in the Rear, which made <hi>Berlo</hi> ſend for more Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,
and chiefly of Foot; but inſtead of ſending him more
Force, they gave him Orders to retreat; Yet he receiving not
thoſe Orders till he was almoſt environed on every ſide; he
was obliged to put himſelf in a Condition to defend a narrow
Lane, which he had poſſeſs'd before by his Dragoons. The
Enemy charged him very vigorouſly, and there he loſt his
life, as did alſo Major <hi>Caſtleman</hi> and ſome other Officers. The
Count of <hi>Flodorp</hi> was alſo advanced too far to retreat without
fighting; and the Cavalry indeed ſtood ſtoutly to it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oppreſs'd with Numbers, they were forced to retreat to
Monſieur <hi>Webbenum,</hi> who commanded the 3d Detachment,
and was poſted on the other ſide of an Hedge. Some Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of the Enemy that purſued <hi>Flodorp,</hi> ventured thro' the
Hedge after him; but they were ſo vigorouſly repulſed, that
they were conſtrained to make more haſte back again. When
this was done, all this Body of Horſe joyned the Army which
was drawn up in Battel-aray not far off: And thus ended the
Work of that Day. The whole Army ſtood in order of Battle
all that Night, and the next Morning they underſtood by a
Deſerter, that the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> was reſolved to fight:
But 2 Spies that made it their Trade to be double ones, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
preſently after, that <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> was repaſſing the
<hi>Sambre;</hi> And in this uncertainty Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> continued till
8 in the Morning, when the <hi>French</hi> were drawn up in Battle-aray,
that there was a neceſſity of engaging. The States Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
conſiſted of about 25000 Men, in regard the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces
and others who ſhould have reinforced them, were not yet
come up; ſo that the Prince could not make above 2 Lines
that extended from <hi>Fleuri</hi> to St. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Army
was above 40000 ſtrong, <hi>Luxemberg</hi> having drawn a great
Number out of the Frontier Garriſons, and having been rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
3 days before, by a Detachment of the Marqueſs <hi>de
Boufflers,</hi> conſiſting of 18 Batallions, 45 Squadrons, and the
flying Camp commanded by the Count <hi>de Gournay.</hi> The Prince
indeed had ſome Notice of this Conjunction, but it was very
uncertain; and ſome ſay, the Governour of <hi>Namur</hi> gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it by a Letter, but that it was not to be believed upon
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:62930:201"/>
any good Grounds. However it were, the Fight being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
upon, the Command of the Right Wing was aſſigned to
the Prince of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> General of the Horſe, accompanied by
Lieutenant-General <hi>d' Huby,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the Prince of
<hi>Birkenfield,</hi> with his Brigadiers, the Prince of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Friezland,</hi> and Mareſchal de Camp, and the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Generals
<hi>d' Alva,</hi> and <hi>Webbenum</hi> had the Charge of the
Left Wing, and the main Battle. Some Horſe alſo before the
Fight-began, were ſent to line the Right Wing of the Army,
which lay in a good Poſt; but whether none were ſent to line
the Left, or that they who were commanded thither, did not
do their Duty, they did not perceive that the Enemy ſlipped
ſeveral Troops behind a riſing-Ground and a ſmall Wood next
the <hi>Sambre,</hi> who poſted themſelves behind the 2d Line of the
Left Wing, which conſtrained them to face about, and turn
their Backs to the Line; whereby being much weakened,
ſome Batallions of the Right Wing were ſent to ſecure their
Flank, and aſſiſt to keep their Ground; Which was no ſooner
obſerved by the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> but he ſaid to the Duke
of <hi>Main,</hi> who was then next him, <hi>Do you ſee what the Enemies
are doing? I foretel they will be beaten.</hi> In ſhort, the Left
Wing was attack'd at the ſame time in Front, Rear, and
Flank; the 1ſt Line, from which, as has been ſaid, one Batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
was taken to reinforce the 2d, after they had fought
ſome time, were forced to give Ground. Whereupon the
Enemy, who knew how to make uſe of that Opportunity, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the 2d, to fall upon their Rear: Now that Line
was already advanced to make head againſt the Cavalry which
they had before them, and which they had routed, and drove
back in diſorder upon the <hi>French</hi> Infantry; But the <hi>French</hi>
had 3 Lines, ſo that no ſooner was one over-turned, but freſh
Batallions renewed the Fight, and with more eaſe repelled
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> quite tired with the Brunts they had already
ſuſtained. Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> perceiving the Left Wing in that
Condition, and that the Horſe, weary of ſuch hot Service,
had for the moſt part given Ground, ſent to their Relief the
Horſe of the 2d Line of the Right Wing, from whence the
Foot had been already drawn for the ſame Reaſon. While
this was doing on that ſide, the 1ſt Line of the Right Wing
was alſo engaged with the Enemy, and had bravely routed
them ſeveral times; and General <hi>du Puy</hi> who charged them
in Flank, had gained 10 of their Cannon; But the Enemy
having 3 Lines on that ſide alſo, and being continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by freſh Numbers, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Cavalry were diſperſed
and broke to that Degree, that the whole Body could never
be rallied again. However, the Count of <hi>Flodorp</hi> got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about a 1000 or 1200 about an hours riding from the
Camp, and brought them on again, but then it was too late,
for that the Infantry were retreated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:62930:202"/>
But however Matters went with the Dutch Cavalry in this
Action, they have had the Misfortune to be eſteemed ever
ſince, the worſe Horſe among the Confederates; And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if they had behaved themſelves as well as the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
did upon this Occaſion, I think, there had been no room
left to doubt of their attaining a compleat Victory; For it
may be truly ſaid, without any Exaggeration, That never
Foot performed greater Wonders; for after they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
by the Horſe, they alone ſuſtained the Charges of the
French Cavalry and Infantry both, being charged in Front,
Flank and Rear at the ſame time, and yet could not be
broken: They let the Enemies Squadrons approach within
Piſtol-ſhot of them, and then let fly with ſuch an unconcern'd
and ſteddy Aim, that the whole Squadron together ſeemed
to ſink into the Ground at once, hardly 30 of the whole
Number getting off; and this Courſe they ſo accuſtomed
themſelves to obſerve, that at length they laughed at their
Enemies, crying out, <hi>Let them come on, we will give them
their Belly full.</hi> The French on the other ſide were ſo daſht
with the Execution done upon them, that they fled as ſoon
as they ſaw them but once preſent their Muſquets, nor durſt
they any more come near them, but ſuffered them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
in good Order, without ever offering to purſue them;
Which made the Duke of <hi>Luxemberg</hi> ſay, <hi>That they had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
the Spaniſh Infantry at the Battle of</hi> Rocroy; Where,
notwithſtanding, the Spaniards performed Wonders; Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
withal, <hi>That it was for Prince</hi> Waldeck <hi>to remember the
French Horſe, and for himſelf never to forget the Dutch Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:</hi>
But what-ever ſome have ſaid in Juſtification of the
Dutch Horſe, the Deputies of the States General, when they
took a View of the Army at <hi>Hawn,</hi> to ſee the Damage they
had ſuſtained, ſeemed to be of another Opinion; for as they
went from Company to Company in every Regiment, they
gave every Foot Soldier a Piece to the Value of 3 Franks,
as a Reward of their Bravery; but gave the Horſe nothing
at all, as being accuſed of fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ling in their Duty.</p>
            <p>This Battle was very bloody on both ſides, the Dutch themſelves owning they loſt 4600 Men upon the Place, a great many wounded, and near 3000 taken Priſoners, beſides
part of their Cannon, which they needed not to have done,
had not the Waggoners cut their Harneſs to facilitate their
Flight; And yet of them the Garriſon of <hi>Charleroy</hi> brought
off 25 Pieces, and 3 of the Enemies two days after. The
moſt remarkable Perſons among the ſlain, were the Prince
of <hi>Saxon Maſquerg,</hi> the Count of <hi>Stirum,</hi> one of the young
Counts of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> the Baron <hi>de Heide,</hi> and ſeveral Colonels,
Captains, and inferiour Officers: And however Prince <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck</hi>
might have been miſtaken as to his Intelligence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:62930:202"/>
the Conſtitution of the French Forces before the
Fight, yet 'tis certain he did all that could be expected from
a General of his Age, and ſo unweildy as he was, during
the Battel, and retreated that Evening with the reſt of the
Army in very good Order to <hi>Nivell,</hi> and next day to <hi>Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,</hi>
as the Duke of <hi>Luxemberg</hi> did to <hi>Villain,</hi> and from thence
to the Place, where the Prince encamped before at <hi>Pieton,</hi>
having put all the Country round about under Contribution;
which beſides the Honour of a Victory, was ſome amends for
the many Men he loſt in the Battel, ſome computing them
to 12000 ſlain, wounded, and made Priſoners; though
themſelves would never own nothing near the Number.</p>
            <p>But what Inequality ſoever there was in the ſtrength of the Armies when they engaged, or their Loſſes thereupon, the States recruited theirs with admirable Celerity, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Detachments drawn out of their Garriſons, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
and Count <hi>Tilly</hi> General of the Troops of <hi>Liege</hi> joined
them on the 22d of <hi>July,</hi> with near 10000 Men of that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick,
and <hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> and ſome <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Prince
<hi>Waldeck</hi> therefore finding himſelf ſo numerouſly re-inforced,
decamped from <hi>Diephen,</hi> where he had been ever ſince the
Battel; And having advanced as far as <hi>Walſwavre,</hi> he was
there joined by the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> with all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
by which Conjunction the Army being deemed to be
near 55000 ſtrong, they moved on to <hi>Genappe,</hi> and ſo to
<hi>Bois Seignior Iſaac;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Luxemberg</hi> re-inforced his
Army alſo on his ſide, and yet not truſting to his Numbers
took care to fortifie his Camp, ſo as not to be forced to fight:
So that there was no farther Action on <hi>Flanders</hi>-ſide this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
and therefore we will ſee how things have gone in
<hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the Emperor towards the latter end of the laſt Year,<note place="margin">Arch-duke <hi>Joſeph</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen King of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> was very urgent with the Proteſtant Electors to meet at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and not only ſent Envoys to importune them,
but writ to them with his own Hand, yet he could not bring
them to: However, the Electoral Colledge met together
with the Envoys of thoſe that were abſent, to whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
delivered himſelf in a moſt excellent Speech upon the
Occaſion, for which they were Aſſembled, which conſiſted
of 3 Principal Heads: The firſt was the Security of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
againſt the Deſigns of <hi>France;</hi> Then the Neceſſity there
was of chooſing a King of the <hi>Romans;</hi> And laſtly, he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
recommended unto them to caſt their Eyes upon Arch-Duke
<hi>Joſeph</hi> his Son, and King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> for advancing
him to that Dignity: In ſhort, what care ſoever was taken
to provide for the Security of the firſt, they proved pretty
unanimous in the Choice of the laſt, as ſuppoſing, and no
doubt it was ſo, there could be no one better method to be
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:62930:203"/>
taken for obviating the Deſigns of <hi>France</hi> upon the Empire,
than to inveſt a Prince of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family with that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which was always given out the <hi>Dauphin</hi> gaped after,
or his Father for him. And therefore Arch-Duke <hi>Joſeph</hi>
was choſen King of the <hi>Romans, Jan.</hi> 24th, and crowned the
25th following, to the no ſmall Satisfaction of the Emperor,
and moſt of the Empire, as it was a Diſappointment to
<hi>France,</hi> who has ſtill more Enemies coming upon her: For
the Memoir which the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> preſented to the
Diet at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> towards the cloſe of the preceding Year,
about his being reſtored to his Dutchy, was now attended
by a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> from the ſame Prince, where he declared War
againſt <hi>France,</hi> and ſet down his Reaſons for it; Declaring
how unjuſt it was in <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. to detain his Territories from
him, under vain Pretences; Promiſed to himſelf to enter
<hi>Lorrain</hi> the following Summer, at the Head of 40000 Men;
and exhorted all his Subjects to ſhake off the Yoke of <hi>France,</hi>
and all the Gentry to come and join with him, and aſſiſt him
to regain his ancient Patrimony, under the Penalty of being
degraded of their Nobility, and deprived of all their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges:
But alas! brave Man, he never lived to attempt,
what he might propoſe to himſelf to effect the following
Campaign: For as he was upon the Road to <hi>Vienna,</hi> he was
ſeized with a Quinzy in a ſmall Village named <hi>Wells,</hi> about
4 Miles from <hi>Lintz,</hi> which took from him the Uſe of his
Lungs, and his ſpeech in a ſhort time, ſo that he was forced
to write down part of his Confeſſion: And perceiving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
near his End, he wrote a Letter to the Emperor;
wherein,<note place="margin">The death of the D. of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
               </note> after he had teſtified his Sorrow for not being longer
able to ſerve him, he recommended his Wife, and all his
Family to his Imperial Care. Then wrote another to the
Queen his Lady, to comfort her for her Loſs; Which two
Letters he gave to his Confeſſor, with Orders to deliver
them immediately after his Death. After this, the Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume
that was in his Throat burſting within-ſide ſtifled him,
ſo that he expired in the Arms of his Confeſſor, the 18th of
<hi>April,</hi> in the Evening.</p>
            <p>The Death of this great Man could not but allay two different Paſſions in the Courts of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Verſailles,</hi> ſince the one had alike Reaſon to be ſorrowful as the other had
to rejoyce before the News came; for there were mighty
Jollities in the Imperial Court at this time for the Marriage
of the Princeſs <hi>Dorothea Sophia</hi> of <hi>Neuburg,</hi> with the Prince
of <hi>Parma;</hi> Whereas in <hi>France</hi> they were putting on their
mournful Weeds for the Death of the <hi>Dauphineſs,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
this Life within a Day or two of the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain;</hi>
but that did not retard the <hi>Dauphine</hi> her Husband's
Journey into <hi>Germany,</hi> for he ſet out the 17th of the next
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:62930:203"/>
Month from <hi>Verſailles,</hi> after he had been ſhut up with the
King for ſeveral Hours in his Cloſet, and received his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
on the 28th arrived at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and from thence
went to <hi>Landau</hi> where the French Army lay, that was to
act on that ſide.</p>
            <p>The Command of the Imperial Army on the other hand,<note place="margin">The Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </note>
was given, now the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> is dead, to the Elector
of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with whom at laſt joined a good Body of <hi>Saxons,</hi>
headed by the Elector himſelf, with his two Sons, who held
a Conference at <hi>Eppinghen,</hi> together with the Field-Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>challs,
<hi>Caprara,</hi> and <hi>Serini;</hi> after which there were very
great Expectations, the principal Part of the Army would
have fallen upon <hi>Hunningen,</hi> which perhaps might take its
riſe from a Story, whether true or falſe I know not, of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Souches,</hi> who commanded part of the Army on <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningen</hi>-ſide,
his going to attend the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> at this
time, and from him <hi>Incognito</hi> to <hi>Baſil,</hi> where he would not
ſuffer the Magiſtrates to pay him the Honours due to his
Character, becauſe he would not have his Journey make a
noiſe in the World; And that in his Paſſage he had view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and examined the Fortreſs of <hi>Hunninghen,</hi> of which he
took a Draught, and from thence privately returned to the
Army. But however it was, there was nothing put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
on that ſide; nor indeed any where elſe of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
For the Imperial Army having encamped for ſome
time in the Marquiſate of <hi>Baden-Durlack,</hi> all Men were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
that inſtead of continuing their March towards the
upper <hi>Rhine,</hi> they fell down of a ſudden towards <hi>Mentz,</hi>
the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> at the ſame time, being poſted near
<hi>Phillipsburg,</hi> and General <hi>Dunwall</hi> Commanding the flying
Army toward the Garriſon of Fort <hi>Lovis,</hi> and General <hi>Zou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
at his former Poſt: Of which motions the <hi>Dauphine</hi>
was no ſooner informed, but he paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> at Fort
<hi>Lovis,</hi> to maintain his Army in the Enemy's Country, and
that in Battle-array, as expecting ſome Oppoſition in his
March, though he had none. <hi>Aug.</hi> 16th, he encamped in
the Plain of <hi>Strotbeffon,</hi> having the Mountains on one ſide,
the <hi>Rhine</hi> on the other, and a large Moraſs before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
40000 ſtrong, and in Expectation of conſiderable Re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements:
With this he deſigned to have taken ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orts
that opened a Paſſage into <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> a Province that had
not yet been ranſacked by the Army, and conſequently would
afford abundant Subſiſtance for his Men; But the Elector of
<hi>Bavaria</hi> would not give him leiſure to put that Project in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution;
and therefore without loſing of time he returned
back with long Marches; and joining the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the two
Electors marched directly towards the Enemy, but all that
ever they could do, could not engage the <hi>Dauphine</hi> to fight;
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:62930:204"/>
who as induſtriouſly, by hard Marches and Stratagems, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
a Battle, as they every way ſought it: And the rather in
that they were ſuperiour to him in Forces, upon his ſending
away a Detachment of 12000 Men towards the <hi>Moſſelle,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Deſigns of the <hi>Lunenburgers</hi> and <hi>Heſſians,</hi> who were
got near <hi>Coblentz,</hi> with a purpoſe to paſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and ſo
fall into the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Treves,</hi> and expell the French
out of that Country: Thus unactively, or at leaſt without
any memorable Action, ended the Campaign on the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>-ſide,
and now we ſhall take a ſtep into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and
ſee whether they have ſhewed any more Vigour there.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the Year was attended with an Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in that Country,<note place="margin">The Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the <hi>Catalins.</hi>
               </note> that wrought no ſmall trouble both to the Vice-Roy, and the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Pretence
was, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> kept too great a Number of Troops
in that Province, and gave them Reaſon to fear they might
be invaded more and more in their Priviledges, of which
they were very Jealous, ſince the uſual Impoſitions were
hardly tollerable; and the manner of the Revolt was thus:
Two wealthy Country-men had Credit enough to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
about a 1000 more, and with that Body they ſtopped
up all the Avenues to <hi>Barcelona</hi> (where the Duke <hi>d? Villa

a Party of the Garriſon of <hi>Barcelona</hi> againſt them, than they
fled to the Mountains, and from thence in a ſhort time after
ſent to beg Pardon of the Vice-Roy, which was granted them;
and all things thereupon were concluded to have been intirely
appeaſed: But they were greatly miſtaken in the matter; for
the Sedition was only raked up in the Aſhes; the Rebels
had ſhewed themſelves too ſoon, in regard the French who
were to have ſeconded them, were not within reach to do
it;<note place="margin">The Fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> So that the <hi>Catalins</hi> kept fair for a time till they had Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of Aſſiſtance and Protection from <hi>France,</hi> when they
threw of their Masks, acted more daringly than before, and
increaſed in Numbers every day: So that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were
obliged, beſides the Forces that Province had, which were
not ſufficient, to ſend for more out of <hi>Navarre,</hi> to ſuppreſs
them, by which they were reduced to great Neceſſity, that
tho' the Duke <hi>de Noailles</hi> poſted with all Expedition to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan,</hi>
and uſed all the Induſtry imaginable to draw his
Army together, yet they had before in a manner dwindled
into nothing; and he found little other benefit of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
than the Advantage of being before-hand with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
in the Field (as he was the Year before, when he took
<hi>Campredon</hi> from them, which ſpent them that whole Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
in the retaking of it, though they could not prevent
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:62930:204"/>
the Demoliſhing thereof) by which means he had the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to take <hi>San Juan Ahaſſus,</hi> a ſmall Fort 2 Leagues
beyond <hi>Campredon,</hi> and 6 from <hi>Gironne,</hi> which incouraged
him to go on, and ſo making himſelf Maſter of divers ſmall
Caſtles that gave him Annoyance, he advanced as far as
<hi>Foulen,</hi> about 4 ſmall Leagues from <hi>Girone,</hi> which he alſo
took in, and then turned his thoughts upon <hi>Gironne;</hi> But
finding himſelf not ſtrong enough to attack the City; yet
being deſirous to take advantage of the ſlowneſs of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
he left <hi>Gironne</hi> npon the left hand, and advanced
near the City of <hi>Vich,</hi> maintaining his Soldiers at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the <hi>Catalins,</hi> and deſtroying all he could not make
uſe of. But I'll warrant you, you are in an amazement
what was become of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> muſt we ſay they were
idle all this while? By no means: For you muſt know, that
by the Month of <hi>Aug.</hi> they had got between 10 and 12000
Men together, with which the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> march'd
towards the Enemy, to call them to an account for all the
Ravage they had committed, but they did not think fit at
this time to abide the trial of a Battle, and therefore haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to retire by the way of <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> which they did effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
and with which ended that mighty Campaign: The
Court of <hi>Spain</hi> being more taken up with the Jollities, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by the King's Marriage with the Princeſs of <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
than with the Cares and Fatigues of a Campaign,
for which of late Years they have ſhewed no great Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
            <p>And now it will be time to ſay ſomething of the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſince the Flames of War began to kindle here this Year: You have heard before how the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> threw
off the Neutrality, and cloſed in at length with the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates;
and that thereupon the Emperor had ordered divers
Troops to ſuccour him, but there was no depending for the
preſent upon them, who were ſo remote, and the Enemy ſo
near; And therefore the Duke making up what Force he
could, and joyning himſelf with the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> Troops, made
up an Army very near as ſtrong as the French; yet they
thought it not proper, after ſeveral Councils of War, to go
in queſt of the Enemy: The Duke indeed was impatient
of Battle, being not able to endure the Enemy in the midſt
of his Territories, and therefore continually teſtified his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
thereof; But the Count <hi>de Lovignier,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Spaniſh Troops, was continually laying before
him, That Mounſieur <hi>Catinat</hi> could not receive Supplies, but
with great difficulty; and that his Army-waſted every Day,
by Deſertion, or Diſeaſes; Whereas the Duke's Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
with new Re-inforcements every Month, and wanted
for nothing, and therefore a little Patience would produce
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:62930:205"/>
aſſured Victory. Thus Matters ſtood when Monſieur <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi>
being ſenſible of the Fault he had committed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
from that place which afforded him means to repaſs
the River <hi>Po,</hi> and Forage on the other ſide of it, uſed his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Endeavours to make himſelf Maſter of it a ſecond time,
but he muſt have ſome Blows for it; For when the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> underſtood his Deſign, and that the Forces which he
he had poſted upon the Banks of the <hi>Po</hi> were not able to ſtop
the Enemy, he reſolved to decamp with his Army to obſerve
the Motions and Attempts of the French: And therefore
quitting the Neighbourhood of <hi>Turin, June</hi> 17th, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
at <hi>Calalarga,</hi> which is over-againſt <hi>Montcallier,,</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
half a League from the Enemy, the <hi>Po</hi> being between
both Armies.</p>
            <p>Here the Duke lay for ſome days; and after ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of War, it was at laſt reſolved to attack the Enemies Rear, thereby to hinder their Communication with <hi>Pignerol,</hi>
from whence they had their Proviſion, in caſe they ſtaid at
<hi>Mons,</hi> where they then lay encamp'd: Wherefore the Duke
<hi>July</hi> 17th, decam'd from <hi>Catalarga,</hi> and encamped about 3
quarters of a League from the Enemy; And the next day
the French decamped alſo by break of day, and by 9 ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
a Body of 400 Horſe about a quarter of a League
from the Army, which obliged the Duke to draw up his
Army in Battel-aray. But Monſieur <hi>Catinat</hi> had no other
Deſign, in making his Horſe advance, than to ſecure the
March of the reſt of his Forces, which moved on to encamp
on the River <hi>Pitana;</hi> yet he ſent in the mean time a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Party to make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Carignan,</hi> but
by accident there was a Party of the <hi>Piedmont</hi>-Army poſted
there, which being ſeconded by the <hi>Vaudois</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
People, prevented the Enemy from coming into the
Town.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> alſo on his part, conſidering the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſneſs of the Poſt, and being fearful leſt the French ſhould make a ſecond Attempt next Morning, he ſent 3 Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Foot, and 5 Squadrons of Horſe to re-inforce the
Town, commanded by the Marquiſs of <hi>Pianezze,</hi> who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
there the next Morning an hour before day; and he
had hardly poſſeſs'd all the Poſts with his Men, before a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
which he ordered to poſt themſelves upon a Bridge
cloſe by <hi>Carignan,</hi> over which the Enemy was to paſs, met
the Van-guard of the French, conſiſting of 3000 Foot, and
2000 Horſe, who were advancing in order to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Maſters of <hi>Carignan,</hi> and who charged the <hi>Piedmontois</hi>
with ſuch a vigorous Reſolution, that the Marqueſs <hi>de Pian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezze</hi>
was forced to ſuſtain the Party with freſh Supplies. In
the mean time the Duke, who foreſaw what would come to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:62930:205"/>
paſs, had ordered 2 Batallians of Foot of the Left Wing of
his Army, and neareſt to <hi>Carignan,</hi> to go to the Relief of
the Marqueſs of <hi>Pianezze,</hi> with the Count <hi>de Louvigniez,</hi>
and the Marqueſs of <hi>Parelle</hi> at the Head of them, who, by
the time that they were come within a Mile of <hi>Carignan,</hi>
found the Fight was begun. Whereupon the Marquiſs <hi>de la
Parelle</hi> entred the Town with one of the Batallions, while
the Count <hi>de Louvigniez</hi> poſted the other in an advantageous
Place.<note place="margin">The French repulſed at <hi>Carignan.</hi>
               </note> The Duke in the mean time, had drawn up his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in Battalia, and was advancing towards <hi>Carignan,</hi> with an
Intention to give the Enemy Battel, in caſe they continued
their Reſolutions to make themſelves Maſters of the Poſt.
The Marqueſs of <hi>Parelle</hi> had arrived juſt in the nick of time,
as the <hi>Piedmontois</hi> had quitted the Bridge; but finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
re-inforced, they reſumed Courage again; which
(when the French perceived the whole Army coming down
upon them) made them retire in ſome Confuſion, after they
had loſt Monſieur <hi>de Savon,</hi> a very good Officer, with a
conſiderable number of Soldiers. The Fight being thus end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there were all the neceſſary Orders given for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and Fortifying of that Poſt; and then the Duke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
very near the Enemy.</p>

appeared almoſt at the ſame time under a riſing-Ground,

being re-inforced with 200 Men more, they ſet upon
the Enemy altogether, and after half an hours Diſpute, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Fort, after they had been once beaten out
of it; and not contenting themſelves with that Advantage,
they purſued the Enemy within Carbine-ſhot of <hi>Lucern,</hi> and
then retreated into the Wood, which put the Enemy into a
Non-plus, that they durſt not attack that handful of Men,
for fear of an Ambuſcade. In the mean time a Meſſenger
was diſpatch'd to the Marqueſs of <hi>Parelle,</hi> who coming next
Morning to <hi>Babian</hi> with 800 of the Milita, he advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Lucern,</hi> which the Enemy had quitted after they had
burnt ſome Houſes; But the Marqueſs met their main Body
at the joining of the two ways that came from <hi>Lucern,</hi> and
put the Militia at firſt to Skirmiſh with them, but they
were ſoon ſcared with ſeeing ſome of their number fall, and
fled as far as the Bridge; yet the <hi>Vaudois</hi> coming up, fell
briskly upon the Enemy, and forced them to retire in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
having killed ſeveral, both Officers and Soldiers, and
purſued them with a great deal of Fury, tho' they made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Halts, till they came to <hi>Briqueras,</hi> where putting
their Horſe and Dragoons to cover the Town, and lodging
their Infantry in the Caſtle, they made a ſtand: But the

in 5, they killed a great number of French Officers that
obſtinately defended the Place, and at laſt carried both Town
and Caſtle, and purſued the Enemy as far as <hi>Miſſion,</hi> and all
this with the Loſs only of 48 Soldiers, and about 9 Officers;
but that of the French amounted to at leaſt 1200, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

               </note> the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> or his <hi>Vaudois</hi> might be elated with this Succeſs, Monſieur <hi>Catinat</hi> gave them quickly Occaſion to change their Note; For after he had taken <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi>
a ſmall Town upon the left of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> he advanced
<hi>Aug.</hi> 17th towards the City of <hi>Saluſſes;</hi> of whoſe march when
when the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was informed, he paſſed the <hi>Po</hi> with
his Army, as well to ſecure the Place, as to offer the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Battel, which the other did not decline: For upon the
18th <hi>Catinat</hi> gave the Signal, and by 11 in the Morning or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the <hi>Italians</hi> to be attack'd by the way of the Moraſs,
which he had cauſed to be ſounded before, and found firm
enough to bear his Men; So that the Duke's Left Wing not
expecting to be attack'd in Flank, the Moraſs being to the
Left of them, made not ſuch a ſtout Reſiſtance, as they
might have done, had they been forewarned. However,
they killed ſeveral of the Enemy, but at length the Cavalry
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:62930:206"/>
began to give way, being maul'd both with the firings of a
Body of Reſerve, and with the great Cannon that plaid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
upon them. But the Right Wing ſtood firm till 3 in
the Afternoon, when being not able to bear the whole brunt
of the Enemies fire, they were conſtrained to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to flight; and ſeveral of them thinking to facilitate it
by taking the <hi>Po</hi> in their way, were drowned. The Duke
himſelf retired with part of his Troops to <hi>Carignan,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
his Loſs, which the Enemy affirmed to be 4000 ſlain
out-right, 11 great Guns, good ſtore of Baggage, ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and a conſiderable quantity of Ammunition taken;
and that themſelves had not above an 150 killed, and about
100 wounded. This Account, tho' it be not altogether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
yet the Advantage every way was the <hi>French</hi>'s, paſt
all doubt; and what was intended to have been ſaved by the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in hazarding this Battle, was the Conſequence
of <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Victory, who the very next day poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of <hi>Saluſſes,</hi> as he did ſoon after of <hi>Savillana,</hi> a large Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
15 Miles from the former, <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and divers other

to <hi>Carignan,</hi> after their Defeat, or at leaſt to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Maſter of <hi>Carmagnoli:</hi> But the Duke not finding himſelf
in a ſtate to abide his coming, retreated to <hi>Monclair</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
his Army, and to wait for the <hi>German</hi> Troops that were
coming to his Aſſiſtance, after he had put 4000 Men into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignan,</hi>
and ſecured <hi>Carmagnola.</hi> The <hi>Germans,</hi> or at leaſt
part of them, ſome time after joyned the Duke; with which
Reinforcement, beſides ſome <hi>Milaneſe</hi> Troops, being near
20000 ſtrong, he decamp'd on the 16th of <hi>Sept.</hi> from <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair,</hi>
and advanced towards <hi>Catinat,</hi> who alſo having been
ſtrengthened with ſome Regiments from <hi>France,</hi> was not at
all ſtartled at his Approach, but ſtood his Ground, while
Monſieur <hi>St. Ruth</hi> was reducing <hi>Tartantaſia</hi> and <hi>Morienna,</hi> with
all <hi>Savoy,</hi> excepting <hi>Montmelian,</hi> under the Obedience of the
<hi>French</hi> King, whoſe Cities ſwore Allegiance to him, and
whereof Monſieur <hi>St. Ruth,</hi> for his good Services, was made
Governour, with an annual Penſion (as 'twas ſaid) of 40000
Livres.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>French</hi> Forces had in a manner, made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Conqueſt of the Dutchy of <hi>Savoy</hi> this Seaſon, you have already an account how far a Progreſs they have made in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> the moſt valuable part of the Duke's Dominions;
and now you will hear of what was more afflicting to his Royal
Highneſs, than any one thing that perhaps befel him ſince
the Rupture. <hi>Suza</hi> is a City very conſiderable for its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as being that which opens a Paſſage out of the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinate</hi>
into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> whenever the <hi>French</hi> ſhould think it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite;
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:62930:207"/>
For every time the Kings of <hi>France</hi> deſign'd a War
in <hi>Italy,</hi> they always coveted to be Maſters of that Poſt. Now
<hi>Catinat</hi> had had an Eye upon it for ſome time, and made
ſome ſecret Paces towards accompliſhing his Deſign, which
yet he could not carry ſo covertly, but that the Duke had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it; ſo that he did all he could to prevent the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
To this purpoſe he ſent away the Count of <hi>Lovigniez</hi>
with 6 Batallions of Foot and ſome Horſe, to ſecure the Place:
Of which Monſieur <hi>Catinat</hi> being advertiſed, he did not take
the ordinary Road, but haſted towards the Mountains, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Men with wonderful Application and Celerity for 6
Days together without Intermiſſion. This Motion of his,
when the Duke heard of, he miſtakingly thought the Siege
of <hi>Suza</hi> had been a feign'd buſineſs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Suza</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged and taken by the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> but that the true Deſign
of the <hi>French</hi> was to give him Battle; and therefore ſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to <hi>Lovigniez</hi> to leave <hi>Suza,</hi> and forthwith to joyn him
with all his Forces. This was no ſooner done, but the <hi>French</hi>
immediately begirt the City, where there was only 6 or 700
Men in Garriſon under the Count <hi>de Lande,</hi> who ſeeing no
likelihood to defend himſelf in ſuch a weak Poſt with ſuch an
inconſiderable Force againſt a numerous Army, or rather
being of a baſe and daſtardly Nature, made ſhew of putting
himſelf firſt in a Poſture of Reſiſtance, but preſently after ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
the City upon Terms of marching out with Arms,
Baggage, and 3 Cannon, and to be convey'd to the Gates of
<hi>Turin.</hi> With this Action the Campaign ended in <hi>Italy,</hi> for
<hi>Catinat</hi> divided his Army thereupon, ſending one part of them
into Winter-Quarters in <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the other into <hi>Provence.</hi>
But while the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was ſtruggling in this manner
with his adverſe Fortune at home, without its having been
in the Power of his new Allies, the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

Joy, tho' he were conſtrain'd to keep it undiſcloſed for a time in

            <p>Here we ſhall leave the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and his Affairs, both Military and Civil, for the preſent, and inſpect a little into thoſe of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and that part of the World, where you
will ſee quite another face of things than laſt Year; For the
Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> had then no more glorious Succeſſes againſt
the Infidels, through the whole Courſe of the Campaign, than
the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> had now over the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and of which
we ſhall immediately enter upon the Particulars. This Year
had not long been begun, when the <hi>Tartars</hi> who had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be afraid of <hi>Poland,</hi> with a Body of about 10000 Men,
fell into <hi>Albania,</hi> ravaging and deſtroying all before them
with Fire and Sword; And tho' the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> who
commanded there, was aware of his Unability to cope with
ſuch a numerous Army of freſh Men, and therefore kept upon
the defenſive part; yet he could not guard himſelf ſo well,
but that the <hi>Tartars,</hi> ſeconded by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſome of the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:62930:208"/>
Country <hi>Militia,</hi> who perfectly well underſtood all the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
ſurprized him at laſt; So that notwithſtanding all the
vigorous Reſiſtance the Chriſtians made, yet being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
by numbers, they were almoſt every Man of them
cut off, and hardly any left to carry the News of that fatal
Deſtruction, it being computed that no leſs than 5000 <hi>Germans</hi>
periſhed that Day: And if ſuch fatal Beginnings have many
times the like or worſe Conſequences; it was ſo in this Caſe
alſo: For the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> fluſh'd with this Succeſs, ſoon
after made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Caſaneck,</hi> a Place of
great Importance. All this made the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> who
lay ſick at the ſame time, order ſeveral other Places to be
quitted. But the <hi>Tartars</hi> not content to have defeated the
Chriſtians in <hi>Servia,</hi> entred into <hi>Wallachia,</hi> to the number
of 16000 Men, purpoſing to drive the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> quite out
of the Province: Of whoſe march when General <hi>Heuſler</hi> was
informed, and finding himſelf not ſtrong enough to reſiſt ſo
conſiderable a Body, he retreated into <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> quitting
the City of <hi>Buchoreſt</hi> to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> where he lay in Garriſon
with ſome Regiments; and no ſooner had he left it, but the
Infidels, purſuant to their uſual Celerity, arrived, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
overrun the Country with their accuſtomed Ravage.
Theſe Advantages ſeemed to be an Obſtacle to the Peace, of
which (tho' the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Embaſſadors, had been ſent away from
<hi>Vienna,</hi> yet they were ſtill at <hi>Comorra</hi>) there were ſome Hopes
hitherto it ſhould have ſucceeded; but now it began to grow
deſperate. Yet to comfort the Imperialiſts ſomewhat for
thoſe forementioned unexpected Loſſes, the Garriſon of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa,</hi>
a Town in <hi>Lower-Hungary,</hi> which had been blockaded
with a Body of 6000 <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and 2000 <hi>Heydukes, June</hi>
30. 1688. and continued ſo till the 13th of <hi>Apr.</hi> this year,

and deſpair of being relieved by the <hi>Turks,</hi> that it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated;
and when the Articles were ratified by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
the Keys of the Gates hanging upon a Chain of Gold,
were delivered to the Count <hi>de Budiani,</hi> by a <hi>Turk,</hi> ſaying,
<hi>I herewith conſign into your Hands the ſtrongeſt Fortreſs in the</hi> Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman
<hi>Empire.</hi> So he took poſſeſſion of it, and found therein
great ſtore of large Artillery, and ſome with old <hi>German</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
on. But whether this might elate the Minds of the
Imperial Court, ſo as to take it for a good <hi>Omen</hi> of a ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Campaign, I know not; Yet this is certain, that the Prince
of <hi>Baden</hi> had other Sentiments of things than many others
were aware of; and never any Prince ſhewed more Dilatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Reluctancy to head an Army than he did this Year:
Much a-do they had to get him out of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and he was
a whole Month at <hi>Vienna</hi> before he went away for the Army,
which was on the 1ſt of <hi>Aug.</hi> He had no ſooner got to the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:62930:208"/>
Camp, but he found things in ſuch a Poſture that he long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was apprehenſive of; For he underſtood that the Grand-Viſier
with 30000 Foot,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Niſſa</hi> and <hi>Widin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </note> and 10000 Horſe had laid Siege to
<hi>Niſſa,</hi> that the Seraſquier with about 10000 Men had beſieged
<hi>Widin,</hi> and that Count <hi>Teckeley,</hi> with an Army of between 15
and 16000 <hi>Turks, Tartars</hi> and <hi>Hungarian</hi> Malecontents had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
to take poſſeſſion of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> which was given him
by the Grand Seignior, now Prince <hi>Abaffi</hi> was dead. The
Prince, not knowing how to remedy theſe complicated Evils,
had no other way than to adviſe with them about him, which
of them it was moſt proper for him to attempt to ſet to rights;
And therefore in a Council of War held with his Officers,
after a long Debate, it was at laſt concluded, That it were
better to hazard the Loſs of <hi>Widin</hi> and <hi>Niſſa,</hi> than of all <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi>
and conſequently, that without endeavouring to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
either of thoſe Places, it behoved them to flie to the
Relief of that Province; and therefore the Army march'd
back again by the way of <hi>Semendria,</hi> in order to move that
way.</p>
            <p>But long before the Prince could reach thither,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Teckely</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi> and routs <hi>Heu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
               </note> or indeed before he ſet forward, <hi>Teckely</hi> had in a manner poſſeſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all the Country; For while General <hi>Henſler</hi> poſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Paſſes from <hi>Wallachia</hi> into <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> with a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of about 4000 Men, to ſecure the Principality on that
ſide, thoſe Troops of <hi>Wallachia,</hi> who were with <hi>Teckely,</hi> and
perfectly knew the Ways, being about a 1000 in number,
paſſed thro' the Woods and Mountains, where they could
not ride, but were forced to lead their Horſes by the Bridles,
and fell briskly upon the Imperialiſts in the Rear, when at the
ſame time <hi>Teckely</hi> with his <hi>Turks, Tartars</hi> and Malecontents at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
them in the Front. Upon this the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi>
who were with <hi>Heuſler;</hi> whether out of Cowardiſe
or Treachery, made no Reſiſtance, but fled immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Woods; ſo that the Imperialiſts alone were forced
to ſuſtain the whole Fury of the Enemy. The Fight was
both long and bloody, but at laſt the Multitude prevailed,
one part of the Imperialiſts being ſlain, and the other taken
Priſoners, there not being above 300 as were ſo happy to
eſcape their Death or Servitude. Moſt of the Officers were
ſlain, the Marqueſs of <hi>Doria</hi> was taken Priſoner by the
<hi>Tartars;</hi> and while the brave General <hi>Heuſler</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
to <hi>Cronſtradt,</hi> his Horſe was killed under him, and
himſelf taken Priſoner by Count <hi>Teckely,</hi> who ſent him
ſome time after ſome Bread and Wine, and ordered the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
to tell him withal, <hi>That if the Emperor had not diſpoiled
him of his Eſtate, he might have been able to have ſent him a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Preſent.</hi> And not long after he ſent him another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment;
<hi>That he would endeavour to render his Impriſonment the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:62930:209"/>
more eaſie, by the Care he ſhould take of his good Vſage;</hi> and
then gave him leave to inform his Wife of his Condition, by
an Expreſs which he ſent her. In the mean time, <hi>Teckely,</hi> as
a Mark of his ſignal Victory, ſent a great Number of Colours,
Kettle-Drums, and 2 lovely Horſes to the Grand Seignior
then at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and ſummoned together the Petty Eſtates
of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> who formally elected him to be their Prince,
and then joyned ſome of their Forces to his, for his Aſſiſtance
and the maintenance of his Right; which the Prince of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
on the Emperour's part is haſtening to diſpute with him,
and ſo we at preſent ſhall leave him on his March, and ſee
what is become of <hi>Niſſa, Widin,</hi> and ſomething of far more
conſequence than either of them.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Staremberg,</hi>

                  <hi>Niſſa</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> who was Governour of <hi>Niſſa,</hi>
after he had valiantly defended the Place, for a long time by
making frequent Sallies upon the <hi>Turks;</hi> wherein he killed
them a great many Men, ſeeing at length the Enemy lodged
upon the Counterſcarp, aſſembled the principal Officers of
the Garriſon to know their Opinion, what was beſt for him
to do under ſuch a difficult Conjuncture, eſpecially ſince they
found there were no hopes of relief now left; for the Grand-Viſier
to incline them to ſurrender, ſent the Count word of
the Defeat of the Imperialiſts by <hi>Teckely,</hi> and of the Prince
of <hi>Baden</hi>'s being forced to paſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> to go and ſecure
the Province of <hi>Tranſilvania;</hi> whereupon it was unanimouſly
concluded that it was time to capitulate, leaſt the Town
ſhould be taken by ſtorm, to the ruine of 2500 Soldiers, that
might be ſerviceable elſewhere. But that which altogether
prevailed upon the Governour was his ſcarcity of Proviſions,
which would laſt but for a very few days: Whereupon a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
was beat, and the Articles concluded and ſigned the 8th
of <hi>Sept.</hi> which were as honourable as could be deſired, and
by which they were to be convoy'd ſafe to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> but they
were not ſo punctually performed as they ought to have been.
For the <hi>Arnauts</hi> fell upon the laſt Battalion of the Garriſon,
and diſarmed them. But upon complaint made hereof to the
Grand-Viſier, he cauſed 10 of the Officers to be put to death,
and offered to pay for the Arms which they had taken, but
ſaid nothing of reſtoring them, and perhaps it was becauſe he
ſtood in need of them: But this was not all; for the Convoy
that were to have conducted them as far as <hi>Belgrade,</hi> baſely
left them between <hi>Perachin</hi> and <hi>Jagodna,</hi> ſo that they were
ſoon after ſet upon by a Body of <hi>Tartars,</hi> who yet were ſo
warmly received, that above 40 of them were left dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Place, and the reſt ſcoured off as ſoon as they could,
and at length <hi>Sept.</hi> 22d after having run many hazards, and
ſuffered all kinds of hardſhips, arrived ſafely at <hi>Belgrade;</hi>
where we leave ſome of them to meet with a worſe Fate, and
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:62930:209"/>
return to the Garriſon of <hi>Widin;</hi> who no ſooner underſtood
that <hi>Niſſa</hi> had capitulated, but they reſolved to do the like,
and obtained almoſt the ſame Conditions but with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Widin</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note>
that theſe laſt were punctually obſerved, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
being carefully convoy'd to <hi>Orſowa:</hi> Though it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
talked then, that they deſerved a leſs favourable Uſage,
ſeeing they held out but from the 25th to the 29th of <hi>Sept.</hi>
which was but 4 days,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Belgrade</hi> beſieged by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </note> although they were but 800 Men.
But this was but playing at ſmall Game in compariſon to what
was to follow, but the Grand-Viſier after he had taken in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendria</hi>
(whoſe Garriſon being no more than 500 <hi>Germans,</hi>
and 400 of the Country <hi>Militia,</hi> defended it for 4 days with
extraordinary reſolution againſt the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, and
were at laſt every Man of them put to the Sword, ſave the
Lieutenant that commanded, and ſome few other Officers)
on the 1ſt of <hi>Oct.</hi> ſate down before <hi>Belgrade:</hi> The Place
had a good Garriſon of above 6000 old <hi>German</hi> Soldiers,
commanded by Count <hi>Aſpremont,</hi> and was well provided with
all ſorts of Ammunition and Proviſions; But the Breaches that
had been made when it was taken 3 Years before by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> were not fully repaired, ſo that they were
forced to defend them with a double Rank of Palliſadoes. On
the other hand the Grand-Viſier, after he had ordered the
foremoſt Regiments of his Van-guard to take their reſpective
Poſts, began his Approaches within Musket-ſhot, under the
Covert of ſome ruined Houſes, which the beſieged had not
taken care to level with the Ground: However, the Count
fired ſo hotly upon them with his Cannon, and made ſuch
furious Sallies, that they were forced to draw a little further
off.</p>
            <p>The Viſier no whit diſcouraged herewith, ordered 3 At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks to be made in the very ſame Place, where the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had done, when they beſieged the Town before, and
aſſaulted ſome advanced redoubts, where though they were
repulſed 3 ſeveral times, yet they returned ſo vigorouſly, and
in ſuch great Numbers to the Charge, that they poſſeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of them at length, but with the loſs of ſeveral thouſands
of Men. The following days they ſpent in carrying on their
Approaches, and raiſing new Batteries, and on the 5th ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the very Palliſadoes, but the beſieged fired ſo thick
upon them with their Cannon, laden with Chain-ſhot and
Cartouches, and at the ſame time made ſuch a reſolute Sally,
that they conſtrained the Enemy to retreat with the loſs of
abundance of Men. The Imperialiſts hitherto had a free
Communication on that ſide the <hi>Drave,</hi> and the <hi>Dunube;</hi> But
the <hi>Turks</hi> making themſelves Maſters of the Iſland next to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoway,</hi>
brought up their Gallies and Galleaſſes to the very
Banks of the Iſland; and ſo ſtopt them up that way. While
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:62930:210"/>
things continued in this Poſture, and that the Garriſon were
full of hopes to tire out the Enemy by a long ſiege, eſpecially
having beaten them out of ſome Redoubts, and a Covert-way
which the <hi>Turks</hi> had maſtered before, an unforeſeen Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
daſhed all their Hopes, and at the ſame time deſtroyed
a great Number of the braveſt Soldiers in Chriſtendom; For
a Bomb from the <hi>Turks</hi> unhappily lighting upon a great Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
where the Magazine of Powder lay, blew it up into the
Air, killed about 1200 of the Garriſon, and wounded a great
many of the reſt, made the whole City ſhake again, threw
down the Walls in ſeveral Places, and ruined almoſt all the
Houſes: But this was not all, for the Fire took in other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines
of Powder, whether treacherouſly or no, or whether,
as it was rather believed, by the means of ſome Sparks, or
Brands, that flew from the great Tower, ſo that the whole
City was all on a blaze at once, which cauſed ſuch a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and Deſolation in the Place, as cannot well be imagined;
there being nothing to be ſeen but the ſad Spectacle of dead
or dying Men, and every body minding more the ſaving of
his own Life, than the Defence of the Town.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving the Effects which their Bombs had produced,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> take <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade</hi> by ſtorm.</note> and encouraged by the Accident, were ſo wiſe as not to let ſlip the opportunity, ſo that upon the 8th of <hi>Oct.</hi>
they made a new Aſſault, though they had opened never a
Breach in the City-wall, but made uſe of thoſe that had been
made in the former Siege, and ſome other Breaches which
the fatal Accident had newly wrought; And in this Aſſault
they fought ſo furiouſly, that though they were repulſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times, yet at length they over-powered the Beſieged with
their Numbers, and cut them to pieces, not ſparing any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
6000 gallant Men periſhed by this diſaſtrous Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune;
And only the Duke of <hi>Croy,</hi> who had a little before
got into the Town, the Count of <hi>Aſpremont,</hi> the Count <hi>de
Archinto,</hi> and ſome other Officers with about 600 more ſaved
themſelves through the <hi>Fiſhers</hi>-gate, and got over the <hi>Danube</hi>
in Saicks, but yet not without the Addition of one Diſaſter
more, which is inevitable at ſuch times: For one of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks
being over-laden with the Crowd of thoſe who ſhifted
for their Lives, ſunk to the Bottom, and the Multitude met
with that death in the Water, which they thought to avoid by
Land. Thus was the famous City of <hi>Belgrade</hi> retaken by the
<hi>Turks</hi> in 8 Days ſpace, <hi>Oct.</hi> 18th this Year, which the Elector
of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had taken by ſtorm, on the 16th of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1688, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Months ſiege, and of which we have given you account
before in its proper Place.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army reſted ſome days after this important Conqueſt to refreſh them;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſſeck</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by the <hi>Turks</hi> in vain.</note> and then though the Seaſon was far advanced, being willing to ſtrike while the Iron was hot,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:62930:210"/>
they advanced from thence, and croſſing all over the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
from <hi>Belgrade</hi> to <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> appeared before that Place the
30th of the ſame Month. The Duke of <hi>Croy,</hi> and the Count
of <hi>Staremburgh</hi> had got thither a little before, after they had
withdrawn the Garriſons out of <hi>Walcovar,</hi> and other Poſts
through which the Enemy was to march, and did their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to put <hi>Eſſeck</hi> into a Poſture of Defence; though they
had little hopes, conſidering the ill State of the Place, to
hold it any long time. This the Grand-Viſier knew well
enough, and therefore he only ſent 6000 Men, under the
Command of <hi>Muſtapha, Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Boſnia</hi> to take it in, who
was ſo confident of Succeſs in the Enterprize, that he attackt
the Place without any Care of Military Diſcipline, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
taking any Pains to make Lines of Circumvallation, or
Contravallation. The Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> who commanded in the
Place, upon the 3d of <hi>Nov.</hi> at Night rode out to view the
Enemy's Works, and went ſo near that a Musket-bullet paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
through his Hat without doing him any other Miſchief,
and there finding the <hi>Turks</hi> remiſs upon their Guard, and
wrought in great ſecurity, he reſolved to hazard a Sally,
and made choice of the day following for it, which was his
Birth-day; Wherefore he ſallied out with 200 Foot, and a
1000 Horſe, and ſucceeded ſo well, that he killed above 300
of the Enemy, filled up a good part of their Trenches, and
took 5 Colours, which he ſent to the Emperor: But neither
this, nor the Scarcity of Proviſions, nor yet the Report of
Relief coming to the Beſieged, could totally diſcourage the
<hi>Turks;</hi> and therefore on the 5th of <hi>Nov.</hi> they fired all day
long with an extraordinary fury, reſolving upon a Storm,
as ſoon as they had made a Breach wide enough to enter
by: The Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> on the other ſide, ſeeing the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
ſo active; and being informed by ſome Priſoners,
that the Enemy made the more haſt to carry the Place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Intelligence they had that General <hi>Battiani</hi>
was coming forwards with Relief, he be-thought himſelf,
in order to confirm them in that Belief, of this Stratagem.</p>
            <p>He ordered in the Night-time 400 Horſe to ſally out with all their Trumpets and Kettle-drums, giving them Orders to divide themſelves into 2 Bodies, and ſo to ſound louder
and louder gradually, to make the Enemy believe it was the
Relief that was expected; which Device, tho' none of the
cunningeſt, ſucceeded ſo well, and ſtruck ſuch a Terror up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they drew off and retreated ſo precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly,
that they left behind all their Cannon and heavy
Baggage. As ſoon as the Duke was aſſured they were quite
gone off, for they fled in the Night, he diſtributed 4000
Florins among the Garriſon, ordered every Soldier a Pound
of Meat a day, and a Meaſure of Wine, cauſed the Enemy's
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:62930:211"/>
Cannon to be ſecured, and their Works demoliſhed; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having given all the neceſſary Orders for the Security of
the Place, he poſted himſelf to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to give the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
an account of the good News, who failed not to ſhew
him all the Teſtimonies of his Favour, that ſo important a
Piece of Service did deſerve: Thus <hi>Eſſeck</hi> was delivered out
of the Hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> by an Event as contrary to moſt
Mens Expectations, as <hi>Belgrade</hi> fell under their Power. But
as if the <hi>Turks</hi> had not made a ſufficient Progreſs this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
already, and for a Compenſation to their Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Eſſeck;</hi> they made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Lippa</hi> in
upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> and found means to re-inforce the Garriſons
of Great <hi>Waradin,</hi> and <hi>Themeſwaer,</hi> with freſh Men, and all
ſorts of Proviſions, which was ſo much the more unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to the Imperialiſts, ſince thoſe two conſiderable Towns
had been block'd up ſo long by them, that they muſt infallibly
have been ſurrendred unto them before another Campaign.
And now give me leave to ſay, That hardly any Story can
parallel ſuch two different Campaigns as this and the laſt
have proved to the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> who the preceding Year were
in a fair way of loſing all they had in <hi>Europe;</hi> for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts
carried before them as far as <hi>Niſſa,</hi> and
<hi>Widin;</hi> and by any thing that appear'd to the contrary,
might have gone even to the Gates of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> had the
Seaſon laſted, for the Country is all open that way; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Turks</hi> this Year, beſides the re-taking of what they
had loſt then beyond <hi>Belgrade,</hi> even recovered that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Place alſo, and advanced afterwards, as it were, into
the very Heart of <hi>Hungary,</hi> beſides what <hi>Tekeley</hi> their Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
did in <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> whoſe Dominion however was not long-lived
there, as we are juſt now going to relate unto you.</p>
            <p>We left the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> upon his march towards that Principality,<note place="margin">P. of <hi>Baden</hi> reduced <hi>Tranſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſtaid two days till the Baggage came up, which could not
follow ſo faſt by reaſon of the Mountains, and narrow Lanes
through which they were to paſs, the 24th he ſet forward
for <hi>Hatzech,</hi> and encamped the 25th at <hi>Nelans</hi> and <hi>Beras</hi>
near the River <hi>Stretta:</hi> The day following he marched
through the Plain of <hi>Hunniad</hi> to that of <hi>Maros,</hi> not far from
<hi>Szalvaras,</hi> where they met with a ſmall Party of <hi>Tekeley</hi>'s Men,
who were ſcouting abroad to inform themſelves of the March
of the Imperial Army, of which, ſome they killed, and took
others Priſoners; and having reſted the 2 next days, they
continued their March towards <hi>Alba Julia,</hi> or <hi>Weiſſemburgh.</hi>
But what-ever methods <hi>Tekeley</hi> might take to get Intelligence,
the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> managed his Buſineſs with ſo much Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Celerity and Secrecy, that <hi>Tekeley</hi> found himſelf invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:62930:211"/>
by the Imperial Army, before he was well aware of
it; So that he could go neither forward, nor to the left, nor
right, without venturing a Battle; which, becauſe he did
not find it convenient to do, he laid hold on the only Courſe
that remained for him to take, and ſo ſafely retreated to
<hi>Moldavia:</hi> But he was in ſo much haſte, that he left part of
his Baggage behind him, and had between 2 and 300 of his
Rear-guard cut off; So that the Prince cleared all <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi>
in a trice. Then having taken all the Care imaginable
to ſecure the Paſſes from <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Wallachia,</hi> and thoſe
which were next the <hi>Danube,</hi> to the end they might be free
from the Fears of any new Invaſion; He ſeparted the Army
on the 1ſt of <hi>Nov.</hi> leaving a good Body in the Province it

where we ſhall now leave him, and take a ſtep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Poland,</hi> tho' we had in a manner as good ſtay at home;
For there paſſed there in the whole Courſe of this year, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little of any Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> both made home-Attempts to draw the King to diſunite from the Confederacy,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Poland</hi> tempted to make Peace with the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </note> and to that end both of them ſent their reſpective Envoys to him; who, tho'
they made a meen of being deſirous of a general Peace, yet
all their Solicitation tended to induce the King to make up
a particular one for himſelf, which yet at laſt did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
contrary to their own, and moſt Mens Expectations.
But while the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Envoy was carrying on his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> harraſs <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

they cut 17 Companies in pieces; and this gave them
another opportunity of making a ſecond Inroad into the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:62930:212"/>
Country, and that farther than they had done before, and
you may be ſure with no leſs Ravage. This rouzed up the
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Courage once more;<note place="margin">The <hi>Poles</hi> unactive in the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the War.</note> wherefore there was a Muſter

When they had ſo done, they march'd homewards without
any further Attempt this Campaign, where we will leave

Relief into <hi>Napoli di Malvaſia,</hi> which we told you they had
block'd up laſt year, as fearing now the Blockade would
prove as unſucceſsful as the Siege then had done. But the
Republick not being diſcouraged herewith, not only order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Blockade to be reinforced, but prepared all things in
a readineſs to begin the Campaign betimes; and ſo much the
rather, becauſe of the Aſſiſtance of 300000 Livres the Pope
their Country-man gave them at this time for the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                  <hi>Neapli di Malvaſia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> where he met
with very ſtout Reſiſtance, tho' the Garriſon were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to about 300 Men, who killed at leaſt 200 of the
Chriſtians upon this Occaſion, before they could carry the
Place, which yet raiſed their Hopes mightily that it would
contribute to the ſpeedy ſurrendring of the Body of the
Town, eſpecially when they found by an intercepted Letter
of the Commander, that he had not Proviſion for above 15
days; and in effect ſo it came to paſs: For notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:62930:212"/>
all the Efforts the <hi>Turks</hi> made to relieve it, it was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
delivered to General <hi>Cornaro</hi> on the 12th of <hi>Aug.</hi> and
with it the entire Conqueſt of the <hi>Morea,</hi> compleated by the
Republick, for whoſe uſe were found in it 73 Pieces of
Cannon, and above 130 Chriſtian-Slaves hereby recovered
their Liberty.</p>
            <p>This matter, tho' ſlowly, yet being thus happily termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, the General thought fit to imploy the remainder of the fair Seaſon in undertaking ſome further conſiderable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize;
and underſtanding that the <hi>Turks</hi> were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
the Republick might now turn her Arms upon <hi>Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi>
upon the Fortifications of which he found they had for
that reaſon beſtowed great Labour and Diligence, and ſtored
the ſame with all manner of Proviſions, he reſolved to bend
his Courſe another way. To that purpoſe, leaving 1200
Horſe, and a conſiderable Body of Foot near the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of
<hi>Corinth,</hi> to prevent the <hi>Turks</hi> that were in <hi>Achaia,</hi> from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
again by Land into the <hi>Morea,</hi> and 12 Men of War
to obſtruct their Deſcents by Sea, he march'd directly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
<hi>Vallona,</hi> a well-fortify'd City, almoſt over againſt <hi>Otranto,</hi>
anciently <hi>Tarentum</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and at one of the ends of the Gulph
of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſeated in the Kingdom of <hi>Macedon,</hi> directly oppoſite
to that City, and was now the Seat of the Baſha of <hi>Epirus:</hi>
It had a ſtrong Fortreſs belonging to it, and a very ſpacious
Harbour, at the Mouth whereof ſtood two Caſtles, that
commanded it. For the putting of this Enterprize in Execution,
the General had with him 19 Men of War, 3 Fire-ſhips, 22
Gallies, 24 Galeots, and a great number of Ships of Burden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and his Army conſiſted of 9000 Foot, 800 Horſe, 3000 Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers,
1200 of the Pope's Foot, and 1600 of the Infantry
of <hi>Maltha;</hi> beſides which, the General of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to ſend a Body of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces into that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
to join him. But the General met with ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Interruptions, and with ſuch contrary Winds in this
Expedition, that he could not come before the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the 12th of <hi>Sept.</hi> which Delays gave the <hi>Turks</hi> ſo much
leiſure to provide for their Defence, that they had got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
7000 Foot, and 1500 Horſe to diſpute their landing,
one part of their Infantry being poſted upon the adjacent
Hills, and the reſt entrenched upon the Shoar; to which
they had alſo added ſeveral new Works and Entrenchments
within the Suburbs of the Town. But all theſe Difficulties
hindred not the <hi>Venetians</hi> from attempting to land the day
following, which was the 13th; to which end General <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi>
having fixed every one to his Poſt, and now preparing
to land, 1500 of the Inhabitants of that Country, with
whom they had held Intelligence, and who had in the mean
time taken care to provide themſelves with Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:62930:213"/>
appeared in good order near to a Place called
<hi>Ayna Fredda,</hi> and began a brisk Skirmiſh with the <hi>Turks,</hi>
which made the General make the more haſte to get on
Shoar, tho' the Sea ran very high (which was no ſmall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to their Deſcent) and tho' the <hi>Turks,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the continual firing made from the Ships and Gallies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, diſputed the Ground with them for 2 Hours: But
then the Sieur <hi>Gennelines,</hi> General of the <hi>Malteſe</hi> Battallion,
was the firſt with his Men that ſet foot on Shoar, being
ſoon followed by Signior <hi>Mohkeenchi,</hi> and Seignior <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura</hi>
with the Pope's Forces. The <hi>Turks</hi> finding they could
no longer well reſiſt, betook themſelves to ſlight, and the
Chriſtians landed altogether without any Impediment, with
the loſs only of 6 Men killed, and 16 wounded; but it was
more conſiderable on the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſide.</p>
            <p>This being done, the Command of the Army was thus aſſign'd; General <hi>Gaudagni</hi> was to lead the main Battel with the Auxilaries; the Sergeant of Battalia, <hi>Spaar,</hi> had the
Command of the Right Wing, and Lieutenant General <hi>Barri</hi>
commanded the Left, while <hi>Reperta;</hi> Sergeant of Battalia, with
his Detachment, was appointed to command the ſecond Line;
the Proveditor-General <hi>Gremani</hi> being in the mean time left
at his Liberty to be up and down where 'twas moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
They ſet forward in this Order, and General <hi>Spaar</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
himſelf on the riſing Grounds, after he had repulſed
the <hi>Turks,</hi> and advanced on the 14th, while the Cavalry,
who was yet on board, landed, <hi>Raperta</hi> being at the ſame
time poſted near the Sea for the Security of the Convoys.
The <hi>Turks</hi> alſo appear'd then,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vallona</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
               </note> but were ſo bravely attack'd by
General <hi>Spaar,</hi> that he drove them back to a great Town
about a League from <hi>Vallona,</hi> ſeated upon an Hill, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by a Caſtle which they took by Storm, and entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves about the Caſtle; when General <hi>Cornaro</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up in the Evening, ordered a Battery to be raiſed, on
which were planted 2 great Guns, and 6 of a leſſer Size,
from which the ſame Night they began to play upon the
Caſtle; Upon this a Reſolution was alſo taken to fall upon
the <hi>Turks</hi> that were encamp'd before <hi>Vallona,</hi> to the number
of 6000 Fot, and 1500 Horſe; General <hi>Spaar,</hi> with 4000
Foot, and 400 Horſe, being ordered for that Service. But
the <hi>Turks</hi> had no ſooner ſeen the <hi>Venetians</hi> advance, than that
they fled, and were purſued ſo among the Woods, that they
were utterly ſcattered.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Chriſtians fell upon another Town, where the <hi>Turks</hi> had entrench'd themſelves, and quickly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd it (notwithſtanding the vigorous Reſiſtance of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
who fired upon the <hi>Venetians</hi> from the Houſes and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
without ceaſing) whereby they depriv'd the Town of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:62930:213"/>
all Communication between the <hi>Turks</hi> and them. General
<hi>Cornaro</hi> was preſent in this Action, and performed all that
could have been expected from a Perſon of Courage, and
an experienced Captain, who had his Hat ſhot off with a
Flight of a Cannon-bullet; But Sergeant <hi>Barri</hi> was ſlain with
a Musket-ball as he was going to view a Poſt; as were ſome
others of note killed and wounded. The next Night they
began to mine the Caſtle, tho' the Enemy fired very deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
upon them till Morning; But upon the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of day, they hung out a white Flag, and deſired to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate:
To which end they let down from their Walls two
of their Officers, who were brought to the General, and
demanded at firſt very ridiculous Terms; but they were
brought to, and at length it was agreed they ſhould march out
with their Arms and Baggage; which they did accordingly,
being about 550 Soldiers, and near 5000 others, who were
all conducted to their Army. But tho' this was happily ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
the main Work was ſtill to do. Wherefore from
hence they returned before <hi>Vallona,</hi> which appear'd to be a
Figure with 8 Angles, environed with a Moat and Couter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp,
and having a Tower in the middle, furniſhed with 20
Pieces of Cannon, beſides 60 more that were planted round
the Town. Not far from hence ſtood a ſmall Wood of Olive-Trees,
with a ſmall Burrough, wherein were 6 Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>Turks, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> which they ſoon made
themſelves Maſters of, carrying their Approaches on at the
ſame time before <hi>Vallona,</hi> which they battered with their
Cannon from the Ships, and Bombs from the Polanders. They
ſummoned the Commander of the Town to ſurrender, who
demanded time till the next day, which was the 18th of <hi>Sept.</hi>
when a <hi>Feleuca</hi> being ſent to ſummon the Baſha a ſecond
time, ſhe found the Gates open,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vallona</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Turks</hi> having quitted the
place in the Night, and of which General <hi>Cornaro</hi> took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
that day. Here, after he had given the neceſſary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for the Security of his new Conqueſts, he re-imbark'd
the Army, with a deſign to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Durazzo,</hi>
but falling ſick by the way, and the Winds proving contrary,
he returned again on the 29th of <hi>Sept.</hi> to <hi>Vallona,</hi> where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
9 days Sickneſs, that brave Man died on the firſt of <hi>Oct.</hi>
which the Council of <hi>Venice</hi> was no ſooner informed of, but
they appointed Seignior <hi>Mocenigo</hi> to ſucceed him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> did not only prove Victorious by Land this Campaign,<note place="margin">The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> beat the <hi>Turks</hi> at Sea.</note> but they had conſiderable Succeſs alſo by Sea; For General <hi>Delphino</hi> having Orders to Convoy the Garriſon
of <hi>Napoli di Malvaſia</hi> to <hi>Cande,</hi> with the Squadron which was
under his Command, did upon the 18th of <hi>Aug.</hi> join with
Captain <hi>Contarini,</hi> who had 12 Men of War, and 2 Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
with him; and on the 29th of the ſame Month being
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:62930:214"/>
arrived not far from <hi>Andros,</hi> he underſtood that the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Baſha who had with him 27 Gallies, 32 Ships, and 6
Galleons, was reſolved to attack him; wherefore he put out
to Sea, and being on the 7th of <hi>Sept.</hi> got near to <hi>Cape St. Mary,</hi>
he had ſight of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet, which was about 20 Miles
from thence. In the Night he got the Weather-gage of
the Enemy, and the next day being the 8th, bore directly
upon the Enemy, who, on their part, alſo endeavoured to
gain the Wind, and to come cloſe up to him. <hi>Delphino</hi> took
the Van-guard himſelf, and gave the Rear-guard to <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini;</hi>
and he was hardly come up in his ſingle Ship with 12
<hi>Turks</hi> Men of War, but they were becalm'd; Whereupon
the Turkiſh Gallies fell into the Rear, and the Captains of
<hi>Conſtantinople, Algier, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Tripoli</hi> bore up the Van,
and ſeemed as if they intended to board the Chriſtians;
But the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies fired ſo thick upon them, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Enemies Veſſels were ſhot through and through.
General <hi>Delphino</hi> had his Hand ſhot off in the Action, which
yet did not hinder him to keep in his Station till the Fight
was over, two other Veſſels bearing up at the ſame time to
relieve him. The <hi>Turks</hi> hereupon would needs fall upon the
Rear-guard, but were ſo warmly received by <hi>Contarini</hi> there
alſo, that they were forced to fly much damnified, to <hi>Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
from whence they made all the ſail they could to <hi>Focis;</hi>
which General <hi>Delphino</hi> ſeeing, and being not able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them, he ſteered away for the <hi>Morea,</hi> now entirely
conquered by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Arms; and which they took all
the Care imaginable the remainder of this Seaſon to ſecure,
by fortifying the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the only way there was
left to attack them.</p>
            <p>Having run through the ſeveral Actions of this Seaſon,<note place="margin">Attempts made by <hi>France</hi> for a Peace with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> and in the cloſe of the preceding one told you of the Death of one Pope, and the Election of another, we are now briefly
to acquaint you, That the differences about the Franchiſes
and other things done by the French Clergy, as was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in Prejudice of the Holy See, were this Year amicably
compoſed between the two Courts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> The
French King, making in a manner, all the Conceſſions, on
his Part, to effect it; and the old Dad, to make him ſome
Recompence for it, laid a Deſign to reconcile the Emperor
and <hi>France.</hi> The Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> as well for their own
Intereſt, as to pleaſe his Holineſs, joyfully (as was ſaid)
concurring with is Holineſs in his pious Project. But all
his Endeavours could never bring the Emperor to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
the Alliances he had ſo ſolemnly entred into, as well
for his own, as the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi>'s Security; And ſo his
Project fell to the Ground: And therefore I have no more
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:62930:214"/>
to do now, than to recapitulate with a learned Pen, and in
his own Words and Order, the ſeveral Remarkables, or at
leaſt,<note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markables of this Year.</note> the moſt notable of them that have happened within
this annual Revolution. <hi>The preceding Year,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for five Conſiderable Battels fought, as it were, in a
huddle; in every one of which there was ſomething worth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Obſervation. The firſt in</hi> Tranſilvania, <hi>where Treachery
contributed as much to the Victory, as Valour: One in</hi> Flanders,
<hi>wherein Surprize had a great Share: One upon the</hi> Sea, <hi>where
only Number got the Advantage: One in</hi> Ireland, <hi>where For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
declared in Favour of true Merit and Proweſs: And one
in</hi> Savoy, <hi>where want of good Intelligence, and the ſmall Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the Vanquiſhed, gave the Fortune of the day to the Victors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not here to forget the Death of the Elector Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine in a good old Age, nor of the Princeſs of <hi>Portugal</hi> of a lingring Sickneſs, which in all probability terminated ſome
Diſputes that in time might have ariſen concerning the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Crown of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The beginning of this Year is remarkable for the famous Congreſs of the Confederates that was held at the</hi> Hague; <hi>where, beſides a greater Number of illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that appear'd there more than upon any other Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>they were adorned with the Preſence not only of two
Electors, and other Foreign Princes of</hi> Germany, <hi>but that
of</hi> William <hi>III. King of</hi> England, <hi>whom the Rigour of the
Seaſon, and the great Dangers of a tempeſtuous Sea, but a
more dangerous Icy Shoar, could not hinder from going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to further the great Deliverance of</hi> Europe, <hi>that he had
ſo gloriouſly begun, and already ſo far carried on (as we
have in ſome meaſure traced in our foregoing Diſcourſe)
and where he repreſented to the Congreſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King's Speech to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</note> That the Imminent
Dangers they found themſelves in, ſufficiently diſcovered the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
that had been committed, ſo as there was no other Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than that, neceſſary for their taking more juſt and better Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
That it was not a time to deliberate, but to act in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
they were in; That the Enemy was Maſter of all
the chief Fortneſſes that were the Barrier of the common Liberty;
And that he would very quickly poſſeſs himſelf of the reſt, if a
Spirit of Diviſion, Slowneſs, and particular Intereſt continued
among them; That every one ought to remain perſwaded, that
their reſpective particular Intereſts were comprized in the general
One; That the Enemies Forces were very ſtrong, and that they
would carry things like a Torrent before them; And that it was
in vain to oppoſe Complaints and fruitleſs Clamours, or unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Proteſtations againſt Vnjuſtice; That it was neither the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
of a Barren Dyet, nor the Hopes of ſome Men of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
ariſing from frivolous Foundations, but Soldiers, ſtrong
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:62930:215"/>
Armies, and a prompt and ſincere Vnion between all the Forces
of the Allies that muſt do; and theſe too muſt be brought to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them without any delay, if they would put a ſtop to the
Enemies Conqueſts, and ſnatch out of his Hands the Liberty of
<hi>Europe,</hi> which was already held by him under a heavy Yoke.
<hi>That as for himſelf, he proteſted to them,</hi> That he would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpare his Credit, Forces, nor Perſon, to concur with them in
ſo juſt and neceſſary a Deſign; And that he would come in the
Spring at the Head of his Troops faithfully to make good his Royal
Word, which he had ſo ſolemnly paſſed unto them.</p>
            <p>But tho' this heartening Speech,<note place="margin">The Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Congreſs.</note> and generous Reſolution in the King, brought every one of the Aſſembly to promiſe for his own part to furniſh as many Troops as he could, to
oppoſe the Enemy, and to concur unanimouſly in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of ſo noble a Deſign, this did not diſcourage <hi>France:</hi>
For the French King thinking the only way he could take, to
divert the Counſels that had been taken againſt him, was,
if it were poſſible, to ſtrike a Damp into the Confederates,
and by ſome ſignal Action, thro' the Terror of his Name and
his Arms, to keep back the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> that was not yet
engaged againſt him; he divided his Armies into two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Bodies; and early, even in <hi>March,</hi> the firſt of them
advanced both by Sea and Land, and came to the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with a Reſolution to beſiege <hi>Nice,</hi> of which we
ſhall give you a ſhort Account, before we come to the other
Body in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Army under Monſieur <hi>Catinat</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
the Place on the 13th of the ſaid Month, from whence
he ſent 3 Batallions to <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> who baſely ſurrendred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the firing of only one Cannon, which killed a Captain;
but the Caſtle which is ſeated upon a Rock, and environed
with good Baſtions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nice</hi> beſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> and a large Moat, ſtood it out yet; and
ſo the French inveſted it on the ſide of the Sea, but could
carry on no more than a ſimple Battery raiſed of great Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
Faggots, and Sacks of Earth, upon which they planted
their Mortars and great Guns: This the Garriſon obſerving,
after two days, march'd out with all Enſigns of Honour,
and the diſciplined Soldiers were ſent by Sea to <hi>Final.</hi> On
the 24th the Fort of St. <hi>Auſpice</hi> was alſo given up without
making any Reſiſtance, and upon the ſame Condition as <hi>Villa
Franca.</hi> Another Fort called the <hi>Montalban</hi> did the ſame
thing, after they had ſtood a Battery of one day, which now
gave the French an Opportuny to attack <hi>Nice</hi> in earneſt;
wherein they met with a greater facility than they expected.
For on the 26th the Conſuls of the City ſent their Deputies
to <hi>Catinat,</hi> who agreed with him at a certain Hour, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
certain Signals to receive the French King's Men into
the City, without the Governour's Privity; of which the
other having notice, attempted to make himſelf Maſter of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:62930:215"/>
one of the Gates, to prevent the Deſign. But the Citizens
being reſolved to ſecure their Houſes from the Ravage of
the Bombs, had taken their Meaſures, and being got to their
Arms, fired upon the Governour's Detatchments; and then
having given their ſignal, the French entred, and took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the City about Mid-night, having promiſed the
Deputies before, that the City ſhould enjoy all their Privileges
and Immunities as formerly. The Governour of the Caſtle
finding how things went, endeavoured to fire the City-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine,
but failed; and being threatned that if he ſhot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the City, the Garriſon ſhould have no Quarter; that
did not deter him, but that he plaid all the 27th day up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the chief Governour's Houſe, and one of the Convents;
But the French made 3 Attacks upon the Caſtle, which were
carried on with great Vigour, notwithſtanding the badneſs
of the Way; and on the 30th, one of their Magazines ſet
fire to a Magazine of Powder therein, which ſpread it ſelf
in a Moment through all the Caſtle, and blew up not only
a good part of it, but killed above 600 of the Garriſon,
and about 50 of the Beſiegers in their Trenches by the Pieces
of Stone and Timber which the Powder carried thither;
So that the Governour, what with this ſad Diſaſter, and that
the French had made themſelves now Maſters of the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Way and ſecond Incloſure, thought it high time to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate,
which he did on the 2d of <hi>April;</hi> and after all, got
honourable Terms.</p>
            <p>But the French did not conceive what was doing in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
to be enough; and therefore to give the Confederates a
convincing Proof of their readineſs, not only to anſwer, but
to attack them in a moſt ſenſible Part; They inveſted the
ſtrong City of <hi>Mons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſiege of <hi>Mons.</hi>
               </note> on the 15th of <hi>March,</hi> before which
Place, the French King (notwithſtanding all the diſſwaſions,
as was ſaid of Madam <hi>de Maintenon,</hi> to the contrary) arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the 21ſt in Perſon, and took a round about the Town,
being accompanied by the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and
the Duke <hi>de Chartres.</hi> Whereupon next day the Trenches
were begun for draining the <hi>Moraſs,</hi> and other Trenches
were begun to divert the Courſe of the <hi>Troville,</hi> and to
force it to run on the other ſide: By the 26th the Trenches
were advanced within an 150 Paces on each ſide, and the ſame
day the Mill of <hi>Hion</hi> was attack'd with the redoubt that cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, and after a double Repulſe was carried by the French
by main Force, with conſiderable Loſs on each ſide: But
things did not end here, for the French having raiſed large
Batteries, with at leaſt 25 Mortars, they play'd both from
the one and the other inceſſantly, and made terrible havock
in the Town, and notwithſtanding the ſtout Reſiſtance of
the Beſieged, the French were advanced ſo far, by the 1ſt

and attack it, which began about 3 in the Afternoon (and
after the Loſs of a great many Men) began their lodgement
thereupon; But when it was almoſt half done, the beſieged
headed by ſome of their ſtouteſt Officers, attempted to beat
them off, and in effect conſtrained the Granadeers, and the
Guards to give way; yet at laſt the Beſiegers, with the loſs
of about 200 Men, regained their Poſt, and puſh'd on the
Siege with great Vigour, and the rather, becauſe they heard
the King of <hi>England</hi> was come to <hi>Vilvord</hi> with the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Army, with an intention when the Forces came up
to attempt to relieve <hi>Mons,</hi> though indeed there was little

and not ſo much as the neceſſary Carriages ready for the
Expedition; which neglect was laid to the Charge of the

Truth of the whole Matter was, That they could not do
well otherwiſe; For firſt the Monks and Eccleſiaſticks, who
were known to be Friends to <hi>France,</hi> and by their inſtigation
the Burghers of the Town, were importunate with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour

each Party againſt the other; there hapned nothing of any

done to the Engliſh was by the wicked Rapperies of
the Country, and the Native Iriſh not in Arms, both which
the other were firſt or laſt ſufficiently quit with; yet
there was not ſuch forwardneſs in either to take the Field,
but that the Month of <hi>June</hi> came firſt,<note place="margin">

Work of the Engliſh proved to be the Siege of <hi>Baltymore,</hi>
which was ſurrendred on the 9th of the ſaid Month; and
from whence after ſome days ſtay there, the Army march'd
towards <hi>Athlone;</hi> and on the 19th very early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Van-guard marched from <hi>Ballyburn,</hi> and beat the
Enemy from ſeveral out-Ditches, within the Walls of the
Engliſh Town of <hi>Athlone,</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Shannon,</hi> and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

was raiſed, and a Council of War held, wherein it was
reſolved to ſtorm the Engliſh Town, that the Iriſh pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to defend, which was done accordingly; for tho' the
Iriſh made conſiderable Reſiſtance,<note place="margin">The Engliſh Town of <hi>Athlone</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> yet the Engliſh went on,
and kept firing till they got to the Breach that was made,
which a French Lieutenant firſt mounted, throwing in his
Granado, and firing his Piece, and ordering his Men to do
the ſame, and with great Bravery incouraged his Party, tho'
he loſt his Life in the Action, and ſo the Town was taken,
and abundance of the Enemy both killed and drowned in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to Eſcape. Then Batteries were planted againſt
the Iriſh Town, which by the 22d in the Morning were
finiſhed, and the Cannon and Mortars began to play very
briskly on the N. E. ſide of the Caſtle, where it was weakeſt,
and continued to do ſo next day when the Tin-boats came up,
and that a Priſoner who was taken gave an account, that 64
Men were in a Mill upon the Bridge, which being fired by
the Engliſh Granadoes, and thoſe within not being able to
quench it, nor get thence, they were all burnt to death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Priſoner and one more who leaped into the Water;
the 24th, was ſpent in raiſing more Batteries, one below
and another above the Bridge, while a 3d was erected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Town-wall by the River-ſide, oppoſite to a Baſtion
the Iriſh had made on the other ſide of the River: And at
the ſame time they were contriving Methods to paſs the
River, but all this while the Iriſh were not idle in raiſing
Batteries, and making other neceſſary Preparations for their
Defence, which did but heighten the Courage of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
who by the 26th fired from 7 Batteries upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Works, and did great Execution; and the Deſign they
once had of paſſing the <hi>Shannon</hi> at a Ford towards <hi>Laneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
being fruſtrate, the General reſolved to try what he
could in forcing a way through <hi>Athlone,</hi> and therefore labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:62930:217"/>
hard to gain the Bridge, but found this to be very difficult
Work. However, on the 27th in the Evening the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
burnt the Breaſt-work the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had made on the other ſide
of the broken Arch, with throwing in their Granadoes, which,
being made of Wood, preſently ſet them on fire; and the next
Morning, which was the 28th, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had laid their Beams
over, and partly planked them, which a Party of the Enemy
attempting to ruine, were every Man ſlain. But all this did
not diſcourage another Party of 10 Men to ſet about the ſame
Work, which they bravely effected by throwing down the
Planks and Beams, maugre all the firing and Skill of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
but they all alſo periſhed, except 2; which made the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
reſolve to carry on the Work by a cloſe Gallery on the
Bridge, and deſigned to paſs the <hi>Shannon</hi> next day, but they
met with ſuch Oppoſition, and eſpecially by having their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
burnt by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that the further Proſecution of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
was deferred for that day, which was the 29th. But on
the 30th a Council of War being held, it was ſtifly debated,
whether it were more adviſeable to make another Attempt,
or to draw off; And though there appeared very great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for the latter, yet the Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> the Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
<hi>Mackay, Talmaſh, Ruvigny,</hi> and <hi>Teautau</hi> urged, That no
brave Action could be attempted without Hazzard; That the
Attempt was probable, and profered themſelves to be the firſt
that ſhould attempt to force the Enemies Works in their
own Perſons, particularly <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> which they happily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
accordingly: For the Detatchment drawn out the
day before, was ordered ſtill to be in a readineſs; And the
General gave command they ſhould be all brought down by
6, the uſual time of relieving the Guards, that the Enemy
might not ſuſpect the Deſign; which indeed they did not,
by the Information given the General by 2 Officers that
Morning that deſerted from the Enemy: So that all things
being now ready, the Conjuncture favourable, and the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
given,<note place="margin">The Engliſh paſs the <hi>Shannon.</hi>
               </note> Captain <hi>Sandys</hi> and two Lieutenants lead the firſt
Party of 60 Granadiers all in Armour, and 20 a-breſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by another good Body, with an amazing Reſolution,
and took the Ford that was a little to the left of the Bridge,
againſt a Baſtion of the Enemies, the Stream thereof being
very rapid and deep; At which time alſo the Engliſh, great
and ſmall Shot, began to play from their Batteries and Works
upon thoſe of the Iriſh on the other ſide, who fired as thick
as poſſibly they could upon our Men paſſing the River, that
yet gallantly forced their-way through the Fire and Smoak,
and having gained the other Bank, the reſt laid Planks over
the broken part of the Bridge, while others were laying the
Bridge of Boats, whereby the Engliſh paſſed over ſo faſt that
in leſs than half an Hour they were Maſters of the Town, and
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:62930:217"/>
of all the Trenches, beſides one beyond the Town. For the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> being amazed at the ſuddenneſs of the thing, and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> quickly gave Ground, and retired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Camp; Tho' a great many of them were killed
in their Works,<note place="margin">The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Town of <hi>Athlone</hi> taken.</note> yet it was obſervable that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when
they ſaw themſelves really Maſters of the Place, were not at
all forward to kill thoſe at their Mercy, tho' it was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the heat of Action. But the Rubbiſh and Stuff beaten
down by their Cannon, was more difficult to climb over; than
a great part of the Enemies Works; which made the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
curſe and ſwear, even among the Bullets, and gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to that brave Man, and right Chriſtian Soldier, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General
<hi>Mackay,</hi> to tell them, <hi>That they had more Reaſon
to fall upon their Knees and thank God for the Victory; and that
they were brave Men, and the beſt of Men, if they would ſwear
leſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were no ſooner entred the River, but an Expreſs was ſent from the Town to Monſieur <hi>St. Ruth</hi> that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army and <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries, who, upon the
News, ſaid, <hi>It was impoſſible for the</hi> Engliſh <hi>to pretend to take a
Town, and he ſo near with an Army to ſuccour it.</hi> But being
very ſoon aſſured that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were in actual Poſſeſſion of
the Place, he greatly lamented his Misfortune, and ordered
ſeveral Detachments to beat them out again; but then he
was ſenſible of a former Over-ſight, in not demoliſhing thoſe
Fortifications of <hi>Athlone</hi> that were next his Camp; for now
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſs'd their own Works entirely againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
So that the more adviſeable way he had now, was to
decamp with his Army, which he did that very Night, and
of whoſe Motion and Reſolution General <hi>Ginkle</hi> had various
Reports. However, he continued at <hi>Athlone</hi> till the 10th of
<hi>July,</hi> when finding the Town now pretty well cleared, and
Works raiſed for its neceſſary Defence, he march'd on with
the Army, and the next day being the 11th, reach'd <hi>Balſhanoe,</hi>
encamping along the River <hi>Suck</hi> upon <hi>Roſcommon</hi>-ſide,
which is a very good Paſs, and where the <hi>Iriſh</hi> might have
given him a great deal of Trouble in gaining it: But they
had found out a better Place, as will appear by this Poſture,
for they lay on the other ſide of <hi>Aghrim</hi>-Caſtle, three Miles
beyond <hi>Balſhanoe,</hi> and were extended from the Church of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodon,</hi>
on their Right, to a Place called <hi>Gourtnapori,</hi> about
2 Miles in length; on their Left ran a ſmall Brook having
ſteep Hills and little Boggs on each ſide; next to which was
a large Red Bogg almoſt a Mile over, in the end whereof
ſtood the Caſtle of <hi>Aghrim,</hi> commanding the way that lead
to their Camp, paſſable for Horſe no where, but juſt at the
Caſtle, by reaſon of a ſmall River, which running through a
moiſt Ground, made the whole a Moraſs, which extended it
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:62930:218"/>
ſelf along to the Enemies Right, where there was another
Paſs at <hi>Vrachree,</hi> having a riſing-Ground on either ſide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Camp lying along the Ridge of an Hill, on the
ſide of which ſtood 2 <hi>Daniſh</hi> Forts, about half a Mile's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the Bogg below, and this cut into a great many
ſmall incloſures, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had managed ſo as that they
made a Communication from one to another, and lined all
thoſe very thick with ſmall Shot. And in a word, the Enemy
were ſo poſted that they could not poſſibly have a better;
which General <hi>Ginkle,</hi> upon viewing their Poſture, and the
Map given him of the Ground, was very ſenſible of. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he ordered the Army to march towards them the next
day, which Monſieur <hi>St. Ruth</hi> obſerving, and ſuppoſing by
their Countenance they were reſolved to attack him, he gave
his Men all the Incouragement imaginable, ordering Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Maſſes to be ſaid in all Parts of the Army; and the
Report went, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were obliged by their Prieſts,
to give no Quarter to any Soul living, but to purſue every
Man to Deſtruction, they being aſſured of a moſt glorious
Victory; and <hi>St. Ruth</hi> himſelf was ſaid to have made a Speech
to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> the day before the Battle, it being found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
among his Secretary's Papers, who was killed in the
Field, and containing in Subſtance,</p>
            <p>How ſucceſsful and fortunate he had been in ſuppreſſing Hereſie in <hi>France,</hi> and bringing over a vaſt Number of deluded Souls into the Boſom of the Mother-Church, that
for that reaſon his Maſter had made choice of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others to eſtabliſh the Church in <hi>Ireland,</hi> on ſuch a
Foundation, that it ſhould not thence-after be in the power
of Hell or Hereticks to diſturb it, and that the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of all good Catholicks was on their Courage to effect
it. He confeſſed, things did not entirely anſwer his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſince he came among them, but that ſtill they were
retrievable; That he was informed, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s
Heretical Army was reſolved to give them Battle; That
now or never was the time then for them to recover the
loſt Honours, Priviledges and Eſtates of their Anceſtors;
urging to them, they were no Mercenary Soldiers, their All
lying at ſtake, and their work beſides, to reſtore a pious King
to his Throne, and more eſpecially, to propagate the Holy
Faith, and extirpate Hereſie; and laſtly to hearten them to
ſtand firmly to it, he aſſured them of King <hi>James</hi> his loving
and rewarding them, of <hi>Louis</hi> the Great, his protecting them,
of himſelf to lead them on, of the Church to pray for them,
of Saints and Angels to careſs them; and in ſhort, of their
being made all Saints, and Holy <hi>Mary</hi> to lay them in her
Boſom.</p>

               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:62930:218"/>
And now give me leave to be a little more particular in the
Relation of this Battle of <hi>Aghrim,</hi> whereof we are juſt now
going to ſpeak,<note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Aghrim.</hi>
               </note> and the rather, becauſe it was beyond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
one of the ſharpeſt Fights that hapned during the
whole Courſe of this War, and wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour
was exerted to the greateſt degree of Glory imaginable. <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
the 12th of <hi>July</hi> being come, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to advance upon the Enemy; But the Morning prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
foggy, they moved not, till it was about 12 a Clock,
which was then done in as good Order as the Ground would
admit; The General at the ſame time going out with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to view the Enemy, who perceiving ſome of their Scouts
upon the Hills, he ordered a Party to beat them off, which
they did, the Enemy retiring within half a Mile of their own
Camp, and this gave the General an opportunity from an
high Hill to the Right of the Enemy, to view their whole
Army, poſted as before deſcribed, and from thence he ſaw a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of gaining the Paſs of <hi>Vrachree</hi> to the Right of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
and where they had ſome Men poſted. To this end, he ſent
a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Captain, with 16 Troopers to force it, but they did
not ſucceed, ſo that the General ordered 200 of <hi>Cunningham</hi>'s
Dragoons to march to certain Ditches nigh the Ford to keep
the Enemy from coming over, and in the mean time, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Army march'd forward. By this time it was two of
the Clock, and the General finding it neceſſary to have that
Ford, and the other ways that lead to the Right of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Army, as the moſt proper means to attack them, ordered
<hi>Cunningham</hi>'s Dragoons at the Ditch to advance toward a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Enemy poſted on the other ſide, who, thereupon,
with another Body that ſuſtained them, all retired behind a
Hill nearer their Camp, where was poſted a greater Body,
who being aſſiſted with other freſh Parties, obliged the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Dragoons to retreat; So that the General ordered <hi>Eppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>'s
Dragoons to get between thoſe Bodies and their Camp,
but this was diſcovered by the Enemy, who had the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in pouring in ſo many Men upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they
would ſtill have been too hard for the Dragoons, had they not
been ſeconded by the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi>'s Horſe, who behaved
themſelves here with great Bravery, tho' not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Loſs. But what was at firſt only a Skirmiſh, had by
this time engaged a conſiderable Body on both ſides; yet the
Enemy in a while retired, and this brought the Generals to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to deliberate whether it were not beſt to defer the
Battle till next Morning, which was agreed on ſo far, that
their Tents were ordered to be ſent for; but when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Enemy to be in ſome Diſorder by what had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
hapned, they reſolved not to delay the Attack, leaſt
the Enemy ſhould march off in the Night, and ſo afford no
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:62930:219"/>
more Opportunities: Wherefore by the Advice of Major-General
<hi>Mackay,</hi> a Perſon of great Judgment, and long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in the Art of War, it was agreed to proſecute the
Battle on the Enemy's Right, thereby propoſing to draw
part of their Strength from <hi>Aghrim</hi> Caſtle, near unto which
their main Body was poſted; that ſo the Right Wing of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> might have the eaſier Paſſage over to attack their
Left, and then the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army might have the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to engage, which was otherwiſe impoſſible, and this
Advice had its deſired end. About half an Hour after 4 in
the Afternoon, a Party of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Left Wing moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Enemy, and by 5 the Battle began afreſh. The
Ditches were ſtrongly guarded by <hi>Iriſh</hi> Muſketeers, and their
Horſe advantageouſly poſted to ſuſtain them: And here the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> behaved themſelves like Men of another Nation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
their Poſts with great Obſtinacy, for they would not
ſtir from one ſide, till the <hi>Engliſh</hi> put their Pieces over at
the other, and then having Lines of Communication from
one Ditch to another, they would preſently poſt themſelves
and flank the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which occaſion'd a great firing on both
ſides, and continued on the Left almoſt an Hour and an half,
before the Right Wing of the Army, and the Center bega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to engage, except with their Cannon, which play'd all this
while on both ſides. In the mean time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in as good Order as they could; And now Major-General
<hi>Mackay</hi> and the reſt obſerving the Enemy draw of
ſeveral Bodies of Horſe and Foot from the Left and move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Right, where our Men preſſed them very hard;
They laid hold of that Advantage, and ordered the Foot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<hi>Earl</hi> and <hi>Herbert,</hi> the former after twice taking and retaking
got free at laſt, tho' not without being wounded; but the
latter, as was ſaid, was barbarouſly murthered, after Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
given by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> when they ſaw he was alſo like to be
reſcued.</p>
            <p>While this was doing here, Colonel St. <hi>Johns,</hi> Colonel <hi>Tiffin,</hi> the Lord <hi>George Hambleton,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſeveral other Regiments were marching over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon the Bog, while the <hi>Iriſh</hi> lay ſo cloſe in their Ditches,
that ſeveral were doubtful whether they had any Men at that
Place or no: But no ſooner were the <hi>French</hi> and the reſt got
within about 20 Yards of the Ditches, but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fired
moſt furiouſly upon them, which the other ſuſtained with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidy,
and ſtill preſſed forwards, tho' they could ſcarce ſee
one another for Smoak. And now the Battle ſeemed ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for ſome time, that a By-ſtander would rather have given
it on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſide, for they had driven the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot in the
Center ſo far back, that they were almoſt got into a Line
with the great Guns, planted near the Bog, which the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
had no benefit of in that Conjuncture, becauſe of the
Mixture of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> with their own Men.</p>
            <p>You hear little all this while of Horſe, but now we are to tell you, that Major-General <hi>Ruvigni</hi>'s Regiment of <hi>French,</hi>
and Sir <hi>John Lanier</hi>'s being both poſted on the Right, were
afterwards part of them drawn to the Left, where they did
very good Service, and the Right Wing of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe
were in the mean time making the beſt of their way to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
the Foot; For they ſaw their Danger, and that indeed
all was at hazard, becauſe of the difficulty of the Paſs, in
preſſing and tumbling over a very dangerous Place, and that
among Showers of Bullets from a Body of the Enemy's Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
and Foot that were poſted conveniently under a Covert-place
by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to obſtruct the others Paſſage. However
the Horſe bravely ſurmounting all theſe Difficulties, lodged
themſelves at laſt in a dry Ditch in the Throng of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Shot from <hi>Aghrim</hi> Caſtle, and ſome old Walls and
Hedges adjoyning; and it is reported, that St. <hi>Ruth</hi> ſeeing the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe draw that way, and beginning to ſcramble
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:62930:220"/>
over a place, where two could only go a Breaſt, and that not
without great Difficulty, aſked what they meant by it, and
being anſwered, That they would certainly endeavour to paſs
there, and attack them on the Left, he was ſaid to reply
with an Oath, <hi>They are brave Fellows, it is pity they ſhould be
ſo expoſed.</hi> However the Horſe made good the Paſs, and my
Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s, <hi>Ruvigni's, Langſton</hi>'s and <hi>Bierly</hi>'s Regiments,
together with <hi>Leviſon</hi>'s Dragoons, repulſed and beat the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſeveral times, making their Party good on that ſide, tho'
not without Loſs.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot all this while laboured under very great Diſadvantage in the Center, which being obſerved by the brave Major-General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> he haſted to their Relief with
ſome freſh Men, and gave Orders to the broken Regiments
to halt, and face about, which they did immediately, and
bravely charged the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who had advanced upon them to
the Center of the Bog, killed above 300 of them, before
they could retreat out of it, and then marched boldly up to
their old Ground again, from whence they had been lately
beaten. Major-General <hi>Mackay</hi> had at the ſame time fallen
upon the Enemy with a good Body of Horſe on their Left,
while Major-General <hi>Ruvigni</hi> went along the ſide of the Bog,
with another Party of Horſe, who did very great Service,
and bore all down before them; but then the Horſe and
Foot of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Right and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Left being mixed,
there was nothing but a continued Fire, and a very hot Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
all along the Line, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> doing all they could to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Ditches, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to beat them out from
thence. But the thing was not doubtful much longer, for
tho' Monſieur <hi>St. Ruth,</hi> when he ſaw the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot in the
Center repulſed, in a great Extacy told them about him, That
he would now beat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army to the Gates of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
yet ſeeing the Horſe preſs over towards the Caſtle, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Brigade of his own Horſe to march up, then riding to one
of his Batteries, and giving Orders to the Gunners where to
fire, as he was marching toward the place where he ſaw the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> endeavour to go over, he was killed with a great Shot
from one of their Batteries as he rid down the Hill of <hi>Kilco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modon,</hi>
the place where the main ſtreſs of the Battle was fought,
being juſt under the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Camp. When the General fell, one
of his Retinue threw a Cloak over his Corps, and ſoon after
removed him behind the Hill, his Guard going off at the
ſame time, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe perceiving, a great many of
them drew off alſo, and in a ſhort time their Army was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Top of <hi>Killcomodon</hi> Hill, where their Camp had
laid, which being levelled, and expoſed to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shot
more openly, they began now to run down-right, the Foot
towards a great Bog behind them on their Left, and the Horſe
on the high way towards <hi>Loughreah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:62930:220"/>
But during all this Action in the Right Wing and Center of
the Army, thoſe towards the Left, that firſt engaged, kept
their Ground, and little hapned on that ſide for near 2 Hours,
and neither did the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Horſe and Foot that were on the
Left of all, diſturb the Enemy as yet, but ſtood oppoſite to
ſeveral Bodies of Horſe and Foot that faced them, on the other
ſide of the ſmall Brook. But then perceiving <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
to drive the Enemy before them, leaſt theſe Bodies that
faced them ſhould fall back to the relief of the flying Party,
they engaged them, and for about half an Hour it was hot
work; But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being then upon the decline, they all
fled out of the Field, their Foot being miſerably ſlaugter'd
by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe and Dragoons, and their Horſe purſued
nigh 3 Miles, yet the Night coming on, with a thick Miſty
Rain, prevented the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from getting between them and
a very advantageous Paſs near <hi>Loughreagh,</hi> which gave many
of them an opportunity to eſcape: However it was computed,
there were no leſs than 7000 of them ſlain upon the Spot, and
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> 600 Soldiers killed, beſides 73 Officers, and
960 wounded; to which number, if we add Officers, they
will amount to near 1100 in all, which ſtill makes this Battle
to be the more conſiderable, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army did not
make up above 17000 Horſe and Foot, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> about
20000 Foot and 5000 Horſe and Dragoons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army lay upon their Arms all that Night, but then taking ſome days of Refreſhment, the General having received divers Informations concerning the State of <hi>Galloway,</hi>
the moſt conſiderable place now left in the Hands of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
next to <hi>Limerick,</hi> reſolved to direct his March thither; when
he had poſted his Troops, he ſent in a Trumpet to ſummon
the Garriſon, who was anſwered by the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
that Monſieur <hi>d' Vſſone,</hi> who commanded in chief,
was of the ſame opinion with himſelf, and the reſt of the
Officers, that they were reſolved to defend the place to the
laſt: But for all this Reſolution, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had paſſed
part of the Army over the River, and taken the Fort the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
were building, they beat a Parley, and Hoſtages were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed;
But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> demurring upon the manner of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendry,
made the General impatient, who ſent once or twice
to haſten their Reſolutions; and at laſt Lieutenant Colonel
<hi>Burk,</hi> one of the Hoſtages was permitted to go in, whom
Major-General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> being, as was believed, inclined to
lay the Treaty aſide, deſired, <hi>When they were ready to begin
again, to give the</hi> Engliſh <hi>a ſign, by firing a Gun into the Air;</hi>
but the other replied, <hi>That they would not fire from within, till
the other provoked them to it from without.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galloway</hi> ſurrendered</note> And ſo after ſome

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:62930:221"/>
whereof was the Submiſſion of <hi>Baldarick O Donnel,</hi> who
had a conſiderable number of Men under his Command, and
in ſome time after, the marching of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army towards
<hi>Limerick,</hi> with a full intention, by the Conqueſt of that place,
to compleat that of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

<hi>Naſſau</hi>'s, becauſe gained under thoſe Commanders. Two
days after, <hi>Caſtle-Connell</hi> and another called <hi>Carruk a Gunnel,</hi>
ſtanding upon the River 3 Miles below the Town, were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
by Detachments from the Army and the Garriſons of
both made Priſoners of War; and at the ſame time the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Ships came up the River, and fired ſome Shots into the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe Camp that was then near the River, which put
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> out of Countenance, who till then were made to
believe, that either the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had to Ships there, or elſe
that thoſe they had would quickly be ſwallowed up by the
<hi>French</hi> Fleet, which they hourly expected. But tho' the Siege
was carried on with great Vigour, and that in the interi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> quitted ſeveral ſmall places daily in the Country,
and Brigadier <hi>Leviſon</hi> routed ſeveral of their Parties in the
County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> and that the Cannon and Bombs did very
great Execution upon their Camp, and within the Town, yet
on the 17th of <hi>Sept.</hi> it was hotly diſputed in a Council of
War, whether they ſhould go on with the Siege, or march
over the River to deſtroy all the Enemies Forage in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Clare,</hi> and then make a Blockade, and it was ſo far car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
for the latter, that an Engineer was ordered to go with
a Guard towards <hi>Kilmalock,</hi> and fortifie that Place: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he got out of the Camp, he was countermanded, and a
great many Paliſado's brought to <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort, as if the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
intended to Winter there. On the 19th it was reſolved
to paſs the River with a Party, either to proſecute the Siege,
or at leaſt to burn the Forage. And that ſame day a Battery
was raiſed between <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Fort and the old Church, to flank
the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in caſe of a Sally from St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gate; and Four
Mortars were brought from the great Battery to <hi>Mackay</hi>'s
Fort, that place being judged the fitteſt for bombarding, ſince
the whole Town lay in a Line from thence; and Orders
were given, in caſe of an Allarm from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
that every Regiment ſhould ſtand to the Poſts aſſign'd
them for that end: But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> declined to hazzard any
thing. On the 20th moſt of the heavy Cannon that were not
drawn off, were now ſent on Ship-board; and I remember
very well, upon the News of this in <hi>England,</hi> moſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Perſons were of Opinion the Town would not be taken
this Year, tho' the News of <hi>Sligo</hi>'s being ſurrendred to the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:62930:221"/>
Earl of <hi>Granard,</hi> came confirmed at the ſame time. But the
General was indefatigable in his buſineſs; For on the 22d
he march'd with moſt of the Horſe and Dragoous over the
Bridge of Boats they had laid, into the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Mackay</hi> and <hi>Talmaſh</hi> to command on this ſide. And all
that Morning the Enemy continually fired upon them from
ſeveral Batteries, but without any great Harm. In the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
a Party of Colonel <hi>Matthews</hi> Dragoons was attack'd
by a ſtronger Party of the Enemy, till being ſuſtained by a
greater Force, between whom continued ſome ſmall firings
till about 4 a Clock, when the Foot came up, which made
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> retire till they were got under their Cannon. Then
all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Granadiers, ſuſtained by 4 Regiments of Foot,
were commanded to advance and attack the Works that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<hi>Thumond-Bridge,</hi> being one Fort to the Right, above a
Musket-ſhot from the Bridge, and another to the Left, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
nearer, beſides ſeveral other natural Fortifications
wherein the Enemy had poſted a Detachment of about 200
Men, between whom and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there was a hot Diſpute
at firſt, and their Cannon playing from the King's Caſtle,
and 2 or 3 more Batteries, as alſo their ſmall Shot from the
Walls, made the Attack ſeem very hazardous, and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
were ordered not to approach ſo nigh the Town as they
did. However, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being now preſſed upon by the
Granadiers, they quitted their firſt Poſts, and then were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced
by another Detachment from the Town; But all
this could not do their buſineſs: For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Granadiers
were ſo forward, and deſpiſed all Danger to that degree,
that they put the whole Body to flight, and purſued them
ſo cloſe, that a <hi>French</hi> Major, who commanded at <hi>Thumond-Gate,</hi>
fearing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would enter the Town with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ordered the Draw-bridge to be plucked up, and left
the whole Party to the Mercy of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſhewed
them little; for all of them were either killed or taken, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
about 120, who got into the Town before the Bridge was
drawn up: There were alſo many of them drowned.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lodged themſelves within 10 yards of the Bridge, notwithſtanding an high Tower that ſtood near the end of the Bridge next to them; and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now all Communication cut off between them and their
Horſe, and deſpairing of the <hi>French</hi> Succours, began to think
of giving up the Town, whereof the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in general had no
great Hopes; who however, puſh'd on the Siege next day,
being the 23d of <hi>Sept.</hi> with much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ury, and notwithſtanding
it proved very rainy, yet the Guns and Mortars ceaſed not
to play upon the Town, nor the Enemy to fire more furiouſly
than they had done for ſome time before. But towards
Night the Rain began to ceaſe, and both Storms ended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:62930:222"/>
For about 6 the Enemy beat a Parley on both ſides
the Town, and next day in the Morning Lieutenant-General
<hi>Sarsfield</hi> and Major-General <hi>Waughup</hi> came out to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and deſired a Ceſſation of Arms might be continued for
3 Days, till they could ſend to their Horſe, who then were
encamped towards <hi>Clare,</hi> in order to their being included in
the general Capitulation which they then propoſed; which
was agreed to, and thereupon the Priſoners in the Town were
releaſed. On the 29th <hi>Sarsfield</hi> and <hi>Waughup</hi> dined with the
General, and then it was agreed Hoſtages ſhould be exchanged
in order to a further Treaty, which was done accordingly.
And next day the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſent out their Propoſals, but in ſuch
extravagant Terms, that the General was ſo far from grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, that he returned Anſwer, <hi>That tho' he was a Stranger
to the Laws of</hi> England, <hi>yet he underſtood that thoſe things they
inſiſted upon, were ſo far contradictory to them, and ſo diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to himſelf, that he could not grant any ſuch thing:</hi> And
thereupon ordered a new Battery immediately to be raiſed;
but upon the Requeſt of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> he ſent them in 12 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
which proved to be the Sum of the Capitulation; for
<hi>Sarsfield</hi> and others came on the 29th to the General and after
long Debate agreed upon Articles, not only for the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Limerick,</hi> but all other Forts and Caſtles in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
then in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> So that they were ſigned
<hi>Oct.</hi> 3d by both Parties. They conſiſted of two parts, Civil
and Military, the firſt being ſigned by the Lords Juſtices and
General, but the latter on our Part only by the General, and
both here follow.</p>

think, the French, elated with their laſt Years Succeſs, might
have adventured a ſecond Fight now: But they knew what
they did well enough, for they had another-gueſs Force and
Admiral too to deal with now, and they had another Game
to Play, which was to intercept our <hi>Turkey</hi> Fleet, which was
exceeding Rich; and to that end, cruiſed a long time upon the

gone but about 10 days from hovering about <hi>Kingsale,</hi> before
the other came, having all that time been held back by
contrary Winds in their Paſſage from <hi>Cales.</hi> The Engliſh
Grand Fleet all this time kept another Courſe, but it was
not for want of Zeal or Fidelity in the brave Admiral, but
of Intelligence. Yet as ſoon as the brave Admiral <hi>Ruſſel,</hi>

<hi>Foſſano, Savillana,</hi> and <hi>Saluces,</hi> was retreated towards <hi>Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol,</hi>

themſelves of this Place; but I did not mention, that
the Articles upon which it was given up to them were not
performed with the Fidelity they ought to have been; for
the French took from the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> that were in Garriſon,
their Cannon, Arms, and Baggage, and threatned to detain
them Priſoners, if they did not give up what was demanded
of them without Reſiſtance: But for this the other reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be now revenged upon them, and therefore they
way-laid the <hi>French</hi> upon the Road, and aſſailed them with
extraordinary Courage, taking away their Arms and a good
part of their Baggage, which the <hi>Germans</hi> obſerving, they
thought it much better to be doing alſo than looking on,
and ſo they compleatly gleaned the poor French of what the
<hi>Vaudois</hi> had left them. Of this, tho' Monſieur <hi>Catinat</hi> made
heavy Complaint, yet all the Anſwer given him, was, <hi>That
they were truly ſorry it ſhould ſo happen, but that he himſelf had

would take care to prevent any ſuch Diſorders.</hi> All this, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> the very next day after the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Carmagnala,</hi> beating 3000 of the French, that were
detached to do Miſchief, into the Vallies, and killing about
500 of his Men, made the French General very uneaſie.
However, this did not hinder the Council of <hi>France</hi> from
reſolving upon the Reduction of the Fortr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they might be in, becauſe of the ſucceſs of his Arms,
might move them to cloſe in with the Confederates, and
thereby encreaſe the number of his Enemies, who, as they
ſtood, might prove too many for him.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis time for us to leave <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſee what has been doing in <hi>Hungary:</hi> The 2 laſt Years were as different in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <pb n="452" facs="tcp:62930:230"/>
to the two contending Parties, as perhaps ever was
known; and the Turks, no doubt, were now big with Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations,
and poſſibly had hopes to regain all their Loſſes by
another Campaign, for which they had made very great
Preparations; neither was the Emperor, on his part, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
therein, but engaging the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> to Command
the Army, he pretty late in the Summer joined the ſame
near <hi>Peter-Waradin,</hi> from whence he decamped with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to march towards the Enemy, who lay about <hi>Semlin</hi>
on this ſide the <hi>Save,</hi> and whoſe Cavalry on the 10th of
<hi>Aug.</hi> ſhewed themſelves in the Morning drawn up in a Line
a little from the Imperial Army; But this was only an
Amuſement, they having no intention to fight: For tho' the
Prince came very near the Turkiſh Camp on the 12th, and
did all he could to provoke them, they would not ſtir out
of it; but he did not at all think it adviſeable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
them there, ſince they were invironed with a broad
deep Moat, defended with good Redoubts, and a 150 Pieces
of Cannon mounted upon Batteries, and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
a little to tempt them to come forth, and ſo much
the rather, becauſe they were forced to go as far as <hi>Salanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
for the Proviſions that were ſent to the Army, which
could not come any further by Water, becauſe the Turks
were more numerous in Saicks upon the River from that
place than the Chriſtians were: And in effect, the Prince
was not miſtaken in his Conceptions, for the Turks think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Chriſtians were fled, ſent ſome Troops to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rear, which they did all the while the Army march'd,
who ſtill continued in motion on the 17th, tho' it was ſo
miſty that they could hardly diſcern one another: But as
ſoon as it cleared up, they heard the Turkiſh Drums, and
found their whole Army was marching towards them; yet
becauſe the winding of the <hi>Danube</hi> hindered the ſight of the
Enemy in that part, only in the flank; the Chriſtians made
a motion to ſecure the Saicks that lay at <hi>Salankemen,</hi> and to
have them to that purpoſe in Front, and tho' the Army was
poſted well, yet upon the 18th, Orders were given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into a more advantageous Poſt, and to poſſeſs all the
riſing Ground about <hi>Salankemen.</hi> But while this was doing,
and by that time that it was day, they diſcovered upon the
right hand a conſiderable Body of Turks, marching in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Battle upon the right Road to <hi>Peter-Waradin,</hi> with
a deſign to prevent the Chriſtians from making themſelves
Maſters of the firſt Hillocks near <hi>Salankemen;</hi> and their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
and Saicks at the ſame time near unto thoſe of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
with a deſign to ſeize them, and 3 or 4000 Horſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with the Left Wing along the <hi>Danube,</hi> skirmiſhing
all day, but ſtill retiring when the Chriſtians made any
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:62930:230"/>
ſhew of reſiſtance; while <hi>Buquo</hi>'s Regiment of Dragoons, (that
in the mean time was detach'd to convoy 200 Wagons that
came from <hi>Peter-Waradin</hi>) was ſurrounded by a conſiderable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Enemy, and after long reſiſtance, were almoſt all cut
in Pieces and made Priſoners, notwithſtanding ſome ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments
ſent to their Relief, who could do no good againſt
ſuch an unequal Number, and the Loſs of this Regiment was
not only confirmed the ſame Day by an Adjutant of <hi>Caprara</hi>'s
Regiment, who made his Eſcape, but that the Recruits of
the Regiments of <hi>Hoffkirken</hi> and <hi>Caprara</hi> had fallen under the
ſame Misfortune, and that all the Baggage, Women, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
and led Horſes were loſt, with 200 Wagon Load of
Proviſion, and 1200 Oxen that drew them. In the mean
time, they perceived that the Enemies Army lay poſted along
the <hi>Danube</hi> upon riſing Grounds, much more advantageous
than thoſe poſſeſt by the Chriſtians, and that they were at
work to fortifie them and to cut off the Chriſtians Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
with <hi>Peter-Waradin.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> ſaw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he had a deſperate Game to play, and that he muſt either
force the <hi>Turks</hi> in their Entrenchments, or periſh in a Station
where there were no Proviſions to be had from any other place;
whereupon the former was reſolved on, and to be the next
Day, which was the 19th of <hi>Aug.</hi> at what time all things
were ordered in the following manner. Duke <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of
<hi>Holſtein,</hi> who was on that part of the Right Wing next the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube</hi>
with his own Regiment and that of <hi>Neuburg,</hi> was to make
himſelf Maſter of the riſing Ground, that ſeparated the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Army from the Enemy, and by that means to open a
way for the Body of the Army; and theſe were to be ſeconded
by 20 Battalions, under the Command of General <hi>Souches</hi> and
Camp-Mareſchal <hi>Staremburg,</hi> and the Army which followed
in order of Battle, had orders to extend it ſelf as much as
poſſible from the <hi>Danube</hi> to the Plain, while the Left Wing
had orders to march through the Plain, and attack the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in Flank and Rear, and this was to be the principal At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack,<note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </note>
becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> had poſted almoſt all their <hi>Janizaries,</hi>
and planted all their Cannon upon the riſing Ground againſt
the Right Wing of the Chriſtians, having nothing to ſecure
their Flanks but only ſome Wagons bound together, and lying
almoſt open in the Rear.</p>
            <p>It was very difficult for the <hi>Germans</hi> to approach them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Hills, Vallies and Miry Ways, which they were to croſs; and tho' they had decamped very early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Attack was not begun by the Right Wing till 3 in the
Afternoon, and they labour'd hard to carry the Trenches; But
in regard, the Left Wing which was to fetch a great Compaſs,
through very bad ways, required a conſiderable time to get
near the Enemy, thoſe of the Infidels who perceived it, had
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:62930:231"/>
leaſure to advance with their Horſe; and with the ſame deſign
to fall upon the Imperialiſts in the Rear. In the mean time,
the 2 Battalions of the Right Wing attack'd the Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and advanced where the greateſt number of <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
were drawn up in very good order of Battle, and very
ſtrongly entrenched, having a wide Moat before them defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with good Redoubts, 100 Paces one from another, with
which the Imperialiſts were ſtrangely ſurprized, who knew
how little time the <hi>Turks</hi> had to do it: But however all this
could not hinder them from bravely advancing to the Trenches,
at what time ſome of the Granadiers went down into the Moat,
croſſed it, and got up to the very Trenches: But all this was
attended with much Loſs, for beſides the playing of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
great and ſmall Shot continually upon them, the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi>
came alſo 3 times out of their Trenches with their Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters
in their Hands, and fell with extraordinary Fury up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Imperial Foot that were almoſt tired and ſuffocated
with the Fire and Smoak. <hi>Holſtein</hi> and <hi>Newburg</hi>'s Regiments
of Horſe, and 2 or 3 others ſuffered very much thro' the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Firing of the Cannon of the <hi>Janizaries.</hi> And at the
ſame time all the Left Wing of the Enemies Cavalry fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Right Wing of the Chriſtians, and very rudely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Regiments of <hi>Caprara, Serau</hi> and <hi>Beck,</hi> that were the
firſt expoſed to their Fury. At that time the Prince of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
ſeeing them in ſome diſorder, and perceiving his Left
Wing was got at ſome diſtance from the Enemy, advanced
with ſome Troops that had not yet fought, and flew with that
Vigor upon the Infidels, that he forced them to give Ground,
whereby a ſtop was put to the Fury of the Enemies Left Wing
for a while: But they reſuming freſh Courage, fell again
upon the Regiments of <hi>Caprara</hi> and <hi>Serau,</hi> whom they drave
upon the Battalions of <hi>Beck</hi> and <hi>Kauniſch,</hi> who were by that
means utterly ruined, before they had time to make their
firſt Diſcharge upon their Adverſaries; yet the Troops of the
ſecond Line, that began already to totter, being ſupported by
two Regiments more, took freſh Courage, and all things
were well again in that Wing.</p>
            <p>Now the Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> whoſe deſign was only to amuſe the Enemy on that ſide, and whoſe principal drift was to charge them in Flank and Rear, ſeeing all things well reſtored
in the Right Wing, haſtned, with other Generals to the Left,
and being arrived at the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp, ordered the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
and <hi>Raſcians,</hi> to the number of 5000 to break in, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
overthrew all before them, making a moſt dreadful
Slaughter of the Infidels, and this was the beginning of the
<hi>Turks</hi> ruin. For the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Raſcians</hi> being ſeconded by
the Regiment of <hi>Hoffkirk,</hi> and 4 or 5 more that compoſed the
Left Wing, the <hi>Spahi</hi>'s and <hi>Janizaries</hi> defended themſelves well
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:62930:231"/>
for a time, but at laſt were utterly defeated; the <hi>Spahi</hi>'s brake
thro' the Battle of the Imperialiſts, and the 2 Lines of their
Horſe received the bloody effects of all their Shot. But the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries,</hi>
who ſtood a little longer, fled ſome one way, ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Night only putting an end to the Slaughter. However
they continued the purſuit next Day, and the Days following,
and killed a great number that hid themſelves in the Bogs among
the Ruſhes, and in other by-places: And the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this Defeat was the Imperialiſts poſſeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the Field of Battle, of all the Tents, Cannon, and all
the Baggage, and of all the Enemies Ammunition and Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
The Mony alſo for the Payment of the Soldiers fell into the
<hi>Germans</hi> Hands, but that proved to be no great Purchaſe, for
they found the greateſt part of the Coin they made uſe of was
Copper: But for all that, the Booty muſt certainly be very great,
though at the ſame time it coſt the Chriſtians dear. For beſides
the advantage of their Camp; it is paſt all doubt, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
never fought with ſo much Obſtinacy and Courage, as at
this time, there being not a Battalion or Squadron that was not
oblig'd to Fight, nor an Officer that was not in the thickeſt
of the Action, and forced to diſcharge his Piſtols ſeveral times,
like the meaneſt private Soldier. The Loſs on both ſides
is almoſt incredible, the Conquerors themſelves owning they
had about 7000 killed and wounded in all, and among them,
a great number of good Officers; but of the Infidels, they
reckoned no leſs than 18000 Men to have periſhed in this
Battle, and almoſt all their Officers were killed, wounded,
or taken Priſoners; and to compleat this terrible Loſs, there
were found not only the <hi>Seraſquier,</hi> and principal Aga of the
<hi>Janizaries</hi> among the ſlain, but even the Grand Viſier <hi>Cuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli,</hi>
who was the moſt accompliſh'd Perſon in all the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Empire; And this great Defeat of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Followers, was
ſo much the more remarkable, in that their overthrow has
been many Years ago calculated by the Learned <hi>Brightman</hi>
out of the <hi>Revelations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia.</hi>
               </note> for the preſent Year. However, the
Succeſſes that attended this great Victory, were not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
as might have been expected; 'tis true, General
<hi>Caprara</hi> retook <hi>Lippa,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> in <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> after
he had poſſeſt himſelf of the Caſtle of <hi>Broda,</hi> march'd to <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſca,</hi>

               </note>
as they had done before by <hi>Poſſega,</hi> and from thence he went
to <hi>Bagaros,</hi> whoſe Garriſon, after ſome ſmall Reſiſtance, were
made to ſurrender at Diſcretion, by which means all <hi>Sclavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
became entirely reduced under the Emperor's Obedience:
Yet there was but little Progreſs made in the Siege of Great
<hi>Waradin,</hi> tho' the Imperial Troops attack'd it with much Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
which after all, they were forced to turn into a Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade.
With this ended the Campaign in <hi>Hungary,</hi> during
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:62930:232"/>
which, Sir <hi>William Huſſey,</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Embaſſador
at the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port, was negotiating a Peace between the 2
Empires, tho' with but little appearance of Succeſs.</p>
            <p>There being nothing at all either conſiderable as to the War,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Campaign.</note> or otherwiſe memorable as to the <hi>Venetians</hi> this Year; I ſhall paſs on from them to the <hi>Poles,</hi> whoſe King at the
Head of his Army, that were about 20000 ſtrong, once more
fell into <hi>Moldavia,</hi> with a further deſign of marching that way
into <hi>Budziack;</hi> yet the <hi>Poles</hi> had not advanced far into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Country, but that they were informed a great Body of
<hi>Tartars</hi> had taken the Field, and roam'd about their Camp
to ſnap their Convoys, which made the King ſend Prince <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomirski,</hi>
Mareſchal of the Crown with 1500 Horſe to obſerve
their Motions. Of this the <hi>Tartars</hi> having Intelligence, they
laid an Ambuſcaſe for him, which ſucceeded ſo well on their
part, that the Prince found himſelf quickly invironed on both
ſides, and no poſſibility of retreating without cutting his way
thro': Wherefore he ſent to give the King immediate Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his Condition, who judging well there was no time
to loſe, ſet forwards towards the <hi>Tartars</hi> with all ſpeed; But
they retreated ſo faſt, that he could but do very little Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
upon them. Hereupon the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army advanced to
<hi>Jaſſi,</hi> which the Hoſpodar had again quitted, and who ſtood
ſtill firm to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Intereſt, for all the King of <hi>Poland</hi>
could do to bring him off of it, and of which Place the <hi>Poles</hi>
not only took Poſſeſſion, but alſo of divers others, as <hi>Roman,
Nimick</hi> and <hi>Novacran;</hi> and after having provided for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of them, the King thought it convenient to retreat
with the whole Army, the Seaſon being too far ſpent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
any further, ſo that his principal deſign, which was to
fall into <hi>Budziack,</hi> came to juſt nothing: However the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellan
of <hi>Chelm,</hi> after having with a Body of <hi>Coſſacks</hi> routed
4000 <hi>Tartars,</hi> who came to relieve it, took the Fortreſs of
<hi>Sorock,</hi> ſeated upon the <hi>Neiſter;</hi> and this was all that was done
before the Army went into Quarters: So that now having run
through the Courſe of the Progreſs of the ſeveral Armies this
Seaſon, there is nothing more remaining, but to obſerve a
few Remarkables this Year.</p>

               <note place="margin">Parliament meets.</note> hoping it was an earneſt of future Succeſſes, which

forth his Right,<note place="margin">Conſpiracy in <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> inviting People to joyn him, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all that oppoſed him with ſevereſt puniſhment, and that
Party was thereupon as uppiſh, as they had been ever impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
The Queen did hereupon give immediate Orders for
haſtning out the Fleet, having the Militia in a readineſs, and
ſome Forcesd eſigned for <hi>Flanders</hi> were countermanded, which
together with other Troops remaining then in the Kingdom,
did in ſome time after form a Camp near <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> In ſhort,
'tis not to be doubted but the late King had real thoughts of
throwing off the Abdication at this time, having a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Army poſted on the Coaſts of <hi>Normandy,</hi> ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
as ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, which was hourly expected
up the Channel, did appear. It was thought alſo that there
had been ſome bold attempts made about this time to infeſt
the Fleet; however it were, the Admiral's addreſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy
kept them clear, and brought the Officers unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
to ſign an Addreſs to her Majeſty, with utmoſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their Loyalty, which indeed they failed not to ſhew
upon the occaſion that now quickly preſented it ſelf unto them.
Whether it was King <hi>James</hi> and his <hi>Iriſhmens</hi> Impatience to
poſſeſs the Eſtates of <hi>England,</hi> or ſome other Intelligence
the <hi>French</hi> King might have to jog him on, I know not, but
Monſieur <hi>Tourville,</hi> with the Fleet, had Orders to make up
to the Channel, and to fight the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> tho' he
was not yet joined by the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Squadron under <hi>d' Eſtree:</hi>
But when <hi>Tourville</hi> came there, he met with an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which perhaps he did not dream of; The firſt Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whereof we at <hi>London</hi> had in a Letter from Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi>
to the Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> Secretary of State, wherein he ſaid:</p>
            <p>THat upon the 19th of <hi>May,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Letter.</note> by Three of the Clock in the Morning, <hi>Cape Barfleur,</hi> bearing <hi>S. W.</hi> and by <hi>S.</hi> Seven Leagues off, his Scouts made the Signal for ſeeing the Enemy, the
Wind Weſterly; That by 11 the <hi>French</hi> bore down and engaged
him at ſome diſtance, and both Fleets continued ſighting till half
an hour paſt 5 in the Evening, at which time the Enemy towedt
away with all their Boats, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> after them; That abou
6 there was a freſh Engagement to the Weſtward of him, which he
ſuppoſed to be the Blue; That he could give no further Account at
preſent, but only that the <hi>French</hi> were beaten, and that they were
ſteering away for <hi>Conqueſt-Road,</hi> having a freſh Gale Eaſterly,
but extream foggy.</p>
            <p>But tho' it hapned to be a Calm all that Night,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Fleet beaten.</note> and Fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy the next Morning, yet about 11 it beginning to clear up <pb n="459" facs="tcp:62930:233"/>
a little, they ſaw the <hi>French</hi> Fleet about 2 Leagues from them,
very much leſſened in their Number, not ſeeming to be above
36 Sail, after whom they made all the Sail they could; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
10 it grew calm again, and about 3 the two Fleets came
to an Anchor, but weighed about 11 at Night, anchored
next Morning, ſailed on the 31ſt again againſt the Enemy,
the Admiral ſteering towards <hi>Barfleur,</hi> and the <hi>Durck</hi> and
Blue Squadron towards the Race of <hi>Alderney,</hi> thro' which,
part of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet eſcaped, the other thinking it not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable
to hazard the Men of War in the purſuit of them
through that dangerous Road, tho' Sir <hi>John Aſhby</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
queſtioned in Parliament about it: But Sir <hi>Ralph Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>
Vice-Admiral of the Red, had better Succeſs; for he on
the 21ſt of <hi>May,</hi> burnt under Cape <hi>de Wick,</hi> near the Shoar,
the <hi>Royal Sun,</hi> wherein was Count <hi>Tourville,</hi> Admiral of the
<hi>French</hi> Fleet, carrying 104 Guns, the <hi>Admirable,</hi> 102; the
<hi>Conquerant,</hi> 80, with 3 more of a leſſer Rate, while Admiral
<hi>Ruſſel</hi> himſelf was no leſs ſucceſsful in purſuit of another part
of the <hi>French,</hi> who hawled in for <hi>la Hogue,</hi> in which Bay he
anchored the 21ſt, and next Day ſtood in ſo far as that he
ſaw 13 Ships hawled in cloſe with the Shoar. Whereupon on
the 22d he ſent in Vice-Admiral <hi>Rook</hi> with ſeveral Men of
War and Fire-ſhips, with the Boats of the Fleet, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to deſtroy them: But the <hi>French</hi> had got their Ships ſo
very near Land, that not any of the Men of War, except
the ſmall Frigats, could do any Service. However, that
Night 6 of the Men of War were burnt, and the next Day
the other 7, beſides ſeveral Tranſport-ſhips, whereof 6 were
Three-deck'd Ships, and the other carrying from 60 to 76
Guns, only one had but 56, and that Ship was overſet and
utterly loſt. The Attempt was very difficult and dangerous,
but it was made with that Conduct and Reſolution, and the
Seamen in the Boats behaved themſelves ſo bravely, that
they took poſſeſſion of ſeveral of the Enemies Ships, and
drave the <hi>French</hi> with their own Guns from their Platforms
on the Shoar. This Action was ſo much the more glorious
as well as advantageous to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſince it was done in
the ſight of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Camp ready to invade us;
and the late King was ſo mortified with the preſent Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
that he ſeem'd, by his Letter to the <hi>French</hi>
King, for ever out of hopes to compaſs his Deſigns that way;
and becauſe ſome may be curious to read it, take it as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

            <p>While we are now, thro' the Bleſſing of God, ſecure from any Foreign Invaſion, by the good Succeſs of our Fleet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the French, there was a Conſpiracy as dangerous, and
of a much baſer Nature contrived abroad by one <hi>Granvale,</hi>
a French Officer, to aſſaſſinate his Majeſty's Perſon, who,
when he came to the Camp at <hi>Bethlehem-Abby,</hi> about the
28th of <hi>May,</hi> was inform'd of the Deſign, and the foreſaid
Perſon ſecured for the preſent; but of this you will hear
more by and by, when we come to his Tryal. In the mean
time how unſucceſsful ſoever the French Fleet had been at
Sea, that King was bent upon keeping up the Reputation
of his Arms by Land, by making ſome further Progreſs this
Campaign in the Spaniſh <hi>Netherlands,</hi> tho' now in a much
better ſtate than formerly, ſince the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Governour, as he did the beginning of this Year;
And therefore on the 22d of <hi>May</hi> he inveſted <hi>Namur,</hi> a
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:62930:234"/>
ſtrong Frontier-Garriſon, in Perſon, before which the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were opened on the 1ſt of <hi>June;</hi> and tho' upon the
News of our Sea-Victory, King <hi>William</hi> cauſed all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Artillery to be drawn in his Camp at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to the
top of an Hill, upon the Right of the Army that looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Namur,</hi> and placed the Dutch Artillery upon the ſame
Hill to the Left, and that the whole Army was drawn out
to expreſs their Joy for the ſame, by a triple Diſcharge of
all the Cannon and ſmall Shot; yet it was ſaid, the French
King took ſo little notice of it, that he ſhould ſay, <hi>Here is a
mighty pudder indeed about burning</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>Ships.</hi> But how
light ſoever he might ſeem to take it, the Conſequence ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it was the unhappieſt Blow that befel that Nation in
the whole Courſe of the War, who never after durſt look
our Fleet in the Face, and hereby left all their Sea-Coaſt to
be inſulted by us, as we pleaſed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enter into the Particulars of the Siege of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi>
which was carried on with great Vigour, and which
King <hi>William</hi> was no leſs ſollicitous to relieve, reſolving, if
poſſible, to fight the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who covered the
Siege, and who, upon Information that the King moved
towards the River <hi>Mehaign,</hi> marched that way likewiſe;
and upon the 8th of <hi>June</hi> the two Armies, which were very
ſtrong, and pretty equal as to number, the Confederates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reckon'd at 80000 Men, came in ſight of one another,
the River remaining between them. The Confederates poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
themſelves of all the Poſts upon the River on their
ſide, as the French did of two Villages ſurrounded with
ſtrong Hedges and Thickets on theirs; but the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
by Planting of Batteries at all their Poſts, were ſo far
Maſters of that River, that the French Soldiers could not
come for a drop of Water to it: And that ſame Evening
the King gave Orders to build Bridges over the <hi>Mehaign,</hi>
in order to paſs it the next day to attack the Enemy, which
was ſo ordered, that the whole Army might paſs in a Front
at the ſame time; but the great Rains that begun that
Evening, and held on for ſeveral days, that it broke the
Bridges, made it unpaſſable for the Cannon, and rendred
this glorious Undertaking abortive; the Conſequence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was the Surrender of the Caſtle of <hi>Namur</hi> on the 30th of
<hi>June,</hi> (for the Town had been given up before) which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the Strength and Importance of the Place, with
the ſhortneſs of the Siege, made moſt People believe there
was ſome fellow-feeling in the Caſe. However it were, ſome
did then report, who pretended to underſtand the Affairs
of the Court of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> That the King had deſired the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to withdraw the Prince of <hi>Braba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſon</hi> from
his Government of <hi>Namur,</hi> and gave him his Reaſons for it;
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:62930:235"/>
and that it was thereupon agreed the Prince ſhould make
the Campaign with the Elector: And this went on ſo far,
that the Prince was at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in order to it. But the French
threatning to ſit down before <hi>Namur,</hi> before the opening of
the Campaign, on the Elector's ſide, he could not refuſe his
going to his Government, when the Prince deſired it, leſt
he ſhould diſcover the Miſtruſt he had of him. However,
the Elector at the ſame time ordered the Count <hi>de Thian</hi>
to accompany him in this Siege, and gave him ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Inſtructions therein.</p>
            <p>The King's Camp was at <hi>Melle</hi> when <hi>Namur</hi> was given up, where he formed a Deſign to ſurprize <hi>Mons,</hi> and was very near being executed; when the Enemy having Information
of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Namur</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> took care of their own Preſervation. From <hi>Melle</hi> the
Army march'd to <hi>Genap,</hi> thence to <hi>Notredame de Hall,</hi> and
on the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> paſſed the River <hi>Senne</hi> in ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,
when they were joined by the <hi>Hanover</hi> Troops, to
the number of 8000, all fine Men. The French encamped
at the ſame time at <hi>Engheim,</hi> with their Right extended
to <hi>Steenkirk,</hi> and where the King reſolved to attack them.</p>
            <p>In the Evening Orders were given out for 6 Battalions to be ready to march an hour before day,<note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Steenkirk.</hi>
               </note> and to parade at the Head of Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi>'s Regiment. The Battalions were,
the 2d of the 1ſt Regiment of Guards, the 1ſt of Sir <hi>Robert
Douglaſs</hi>'s, Col. <hi>Fitz-Patrick,</hi> Col. <hi>O Farrel</hi>'s, a Battalion of
the Daniſh Guards, and the Queens. Orders were likewiſe
given for 17 Men in each Battalion in <hi>Churchil</hi>'s Brigrade to
be ready at the Time and Place, and to be commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Manwayring,</hi> their buſineſs being to make
the Ways through the <hi>Deſiles;</hi> they were all to receive a
Ducat a Head for their Labour; and as they were to join
with the Van-guard in time of buſineſs, they carried their
Arms with them as well as Hatchets and Spades. All this
Detachment was to be commanded by the Duke of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi>
as the Van-guard of our Army. Orders were likewiſe
given for the whole Army to march very early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the General to beat at break of Day, and the Army
to be ready at Sun-riſing. All theſe Preparations were in
order to attack the French the next day in their own Camp
at <hi>Enghein,</hi> who the ſame Day as we march'd from <hi>Gennap</hi>
to <hi>Hall,</hi> decamp'd from <hi>Soignes,</hi> and made all haſte to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hein,</hi>
leſt we ſhould get that Ground from them, and thus
oblige them to get farther to their own Conqueſts; <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>'s
Right being at <hi>Steenkirk,</hi> and his Left at <hi>Enghein,</hi> he
took his Quarters at <hi>Hove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to Orders, the 6 Battalions paraded at the Head of Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi>'s Regiment, and the Detachment of 17 Men <hi>per</hi> Battalion of <hi>Churchil</hi>'s Brigade, and received the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:62930:235"/>
Command of Prince <hi>Wirtemberg;</hi> and very early in the
Morning the whole Army followed them, makign their way
to the Enemies Camp thro' nothing but Defiles, being cloſe
Ground all the way, and no other way but ſuch as was made
by our Detachment for that purpoſe; the Baggage being
left behind, by order, at the Camp at <hi>Hall.</hi> About 9 or
10 in the Morning our Van-guard came to the advanced
Poſts of the Enemy, the Mareſchal of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> (as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
Account gives it) having been informed of our Deſign
by Monſieur <hi>Tracey</hi> (who commanded a Detachment of Horſe
that Night between the Enemies Camp and Ours) had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care to poſſeſs himſelf of the moſt conſiderable Poſts in
the Defiles; But notwithſtanding this, our Van-guard oblig'd
the Enemy to retreat from them all, till they came to a
little Wood, juſt upon the Right of the Enemies Camp, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a ſmall Guard in a Village upon the Left of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,
almoſt a League from the Enemies Camp, who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the march of our Army, were all made Priſoners of War,
their number being about 30 Men and an Officer.</p>
            <p>Between 10 and 11 in the Morning, our advanc'd Guards under the Command of the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> lodged themſelves in the Wood that fronted the Right of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Army; the Danes and the Battalion of Guards taking
their Poſt upon the Left in the Wood, and Sir <hi>Robert Douglas,
Fitz-patrick</hi>'s, and <hi>O Farrel</hi>'s upon the Right of them. On
the other ſide of the Wood was the Enemies Camp, a little
Valley remaining between, and a great many Hedges, which
the Enemy reſolved to maintain with all Vigour poſſible,
tho' they yielded ſo eaſily their advanced Poſts. Prince
<hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> planted upon a little Riſing on the Left of the
Wood, a Battery of Cannon, which began to play about 11,
and another upon the Right by Sir <hi>Robert Douglas</hi> his
Battalion, Captain <hi>Macrackan</hi> of the ſame Regiment, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
was killed, pointed a Cannon from his Battery ſo
ſucceſsfully, that it put a whole Battalion of the Enemies in
diſorder, ſweeping almoſt an entire Rank before it. Whilſt
Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> was playing upon the Enemy with theſe
Batteries of Cannon, the Army marched up to the Head of
the Defile (about half an Engliſh Mile from the Wood)
where it opened in a little Plain upon our Right, not above
half a League over, which terminated upon the Right of
the Wood, where our Van-guard was, and at the Right of
our Army, upon ſeveral Rows of high Trees, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
planted in great order, as if 'twas the Avenue of ſome
Perſon of Quality's Houſe, which being towards <hi>Enghein,</hi>
makes my Author ſuppoſe that they might belong to the
Duke of <hi>Arſchot</hi>'s Houſe, where thoſe famous Gardens be,
as are ſaid to be the Pattern of <hi>Verſailles.</hi> Thro' theſe, ſtrait
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:62930:236"/>
before us, on the other ſide of the Plain, they could ſee the
French Infantry drawn up in two Lines, and making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Right to defend the Poſt upon the Wood.
Upon the Right of this Plain, not far from theſe Groves
and Rows of Trees, there was a pretty conſiderable
Farm, which ſoon after the Engagement was ſet on fire by
the Enemy, to cover (as 'tis ſaid) ſeveral of their Battalions
by the Smoak, who were ordered this way, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
engag'd with <hi>Fag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi>'s Brigade, between this Houſe and
the Wood, where our advanc'd Guard was poſted. From
the Head of our Defile, upon the Left of the Plain, there
went for almoſt half a Mile in length, a deep hallow way
with high Trees and Hedges upon the Banks of it, which
reach'd as far as the Wood, where the Van-guard was poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and where it branched it ſelf in 2 other deep ways, one
going thro' the Wood upon the Left to the Danes Attack,
and to that of the Guards; one almoſt ſtreight forwards,
and the other upon the right going along the out-ſide of the
Wood; between theſe two laſt, was the Place where Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Douglas,</hi> Col. <hi>Fitz-patrick</hi>'s, and <hi>O Farrel</hi>'s Regiments
were poſted. On the other ſide of the deep Way as went
from the Head of our Defile to the Poſt, where was our
Van-guard, went ſeveral narrow Fields, which lay between
it all along, and a part of the Wood which reach'd as far as
our advanc'd Guards to our Defiles.</p>
            <p>When the Army was come up to the Head of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files, and juſt entring into the ſmall Plains, they were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to halt, except the Engliſh Life-guards, and Horſe and
Dragoons, which were commanded upon the Right Skirts
of the Wood, where was our Van-guard, and my Lord
<hi>Cutts</hi>'s, Lieutenant-General <hi>Mackay</hi>'s, Sir <hi>Charles Graham</hi>'s,
and Earl of <hi>Angus</hi>'s Regiments, which being interlin'd with
the Engliſh Horſe, were commanded at the ſame time to the
out-ſide of the Wood, on this ſide of that way as branch'd
upon the Right, which made the Figure of the Arch of a
Circle, as the Skirts of the Wood did here before us. Theſe
4 Regiments were poſted here, to be ready to ſecond the
Attack of our Van-guard. Prince of <hi>Heſſe</hi>'s, Col. <hi>Louder</hi>'s,
and Earl of <hi>Leven</hi>'s Regiments, who were alſo interlin'd with
the Left Wing of Horſe, were likewiſe poſted upon the ſide
of the Wood. Things being thus diſpos'd, and our Army
continuing in their Halt, Prince <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> after he had
connonaded for above 2 Hours, begun the Attack with the
Danes upon the Right, which was immediately follow'd by
the other 4 Engliſh Regiments as compos'd our Van-guard,
and ſeconded by <hi>Cutts, Mackay, Angus, Graham, Lauder,</hi> the
Prince of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and <hi>Leven</hi>'s Regiments. Certainly never
was a more dreadful, and at the ſame time bolder firing
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:62930:236"/>
heard, which for the ſpace of 2 Hours ſeem'd to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Thunder, and equalled the noiſe, even of the loudeſt
Claps; our Van-guard behaved themſelves in this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to ſuch wonder and admiration, that tho' they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Charge of ſeveral Battalions of the Enemies, one
after another, yet they made them retreat almoſt into their
very Camp, ſo far, that the ſecond Battalion of the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Guards poſſeſs'd themſelves of a Battery of the
Enemies Cannon, which the Enemy were oblig'd to quit by
the Vigour of our Charge; and Colonel <hi>Wacup,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Battalion, and who behav'd himſelf extreamly
well on this Occaſion, plac'd a Serjeant and Guard upon it;
but the French having cut off the Traces, and taken away
the Horſes, we could not bring them off, but were obliged
afterwards to leave them. Sir <hi>R. Douglas</hi> with his firſt Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion,
charg'd ſeveral of the Enemies, and beat them from
3 ſeveral Hedges, and had made himſelf Maſter of the 4th,
where going thro' a Gap to get on the other ſide, he was
unfortunately killed upon the Spot; all the other Regiments
performing equal Wonder, and behaved themſelves with the
ſame Bravery, and beating the Enemies from the Hedges ſo
far, that in this Hedge-fighting, their firing was generally
Muzzle to Muzzle, we on the one ſide, and the Enemy on
the other.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Army: As ſoon as they were come to the Head of the Defile, it was order'd to halt, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Left Wing of Horſe, that the Foot that were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin'd
with them, which were moſt Engliſh and Scotch, and
which I have before mentioned, might march up thro' the
Horſe; they were obliged to this Halt, tho' it was the loſs
of the day; becauſe the Ground was ſo ſtreight, and the
Enemy had ſuch Hedges, Copſes, and little Woods to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, that there was nothing to do for the Horſe; So
that when the Van-guard began to engage, they had none but
part of the Infantry interlined with the Left Wing of Horſe,
to ſecond them, the Body of the Infantry being almoſt a
Mile in the Rear. However, as ſoon as the Action began,
the King made all diligence poſſible to get the Infantry up,
ordering a Brigade to march up to the Wood, and forming
a Line of Battel in the Plain with that Infantry as could come
up. The Soldiers ſhewed ſuch eagerneſs to come to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that they ran to the Relief of thoſe that were engaged,
even ſo faſt, that they put themſelves into ſome diſorder,
which was the Reaſon that they took more time to form their
Battalions, than was at that time convenient: This was the
Caſe of thoſe Battalions that were ſent to the Wood to the
Relief of our Van-guard; ſo that when they came up, our
Van-guard and Infantry of the Left Wing being over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:62930:237"/>
by the vaſt many Battalions of the Enemy, as charged
them ſucceſſively one after another; and laſtly, by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
of <hi>Boufflers</hi>'s freſh Troops, they were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
in great Diſorder, and to leave the Wood, in which
they had lodged themſelves, entirely to the Enemies Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.
The Baron of <hi>Pibrack</hi>'s Regiment of <hi>Lunemburgers</hi>
being in great Diſorder in the Skirt of the Wood, and the
Baron their Colonel lying dangerouſly wounded upon the
Place, (which he got in rallying of his Regiment) the Earl
of <hi>Bath</hi>'s (one of the Regiments that was commanded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Wood, the other Engliſh being Brigadier <hi>Churchil</hi>'s)
was ordered by Prince <hi>Caſimir</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> to their Relief; two
Sergeants of this Regiment reſcued the Colonel who lay
wounded almoſt in the Enemies Hand, and brought him off
in ſpite of their Fire. Upon theſe Orders of Prince <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimir</hi>
of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Sir <hi>Bevil Granville,</hi> who commanded the
Earl of <hi>Bath</hi>'s Regiment, march'd up to the Relief of this
<hi>Lunemburg</hi> Regiment, bearing the Enemies Fire, before he
ſuffered any Plattoon of his Battalion to diſcharge once;
by which Method the Regiment lodg'd it ſelf in the Trench,
or deep Way that lay upon the Skirt of the Wood, which
it maintain'd, till it was commanded off again by the ſaid
Prince of <hi>Naſſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King having formed a Line of as many Battalions as could come up in this little Plain, the Enemy upon their Right, and our Left of the Wood, as we fac'd, planted a
Battery of about 10 Pieces of Cannon to put them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
by their Fire, we at the ſame time brought another
againſt it, and thus continued firing one upon another a
conſiderable time. What Miſchief our Men did to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
by our Cannon then, I cannot tell, but theirs killed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of our Soldiers, ſome in the Regiment of Fuzileers,
and ſome in the Battalion of the ſecond Regiment of Guards,
but the moſt conſiderable Loſs we ſuſtained by it, was Col.
<hi>Hodges,</hi> who was ſhot with a Cannon-ball at the Head of
his Regiment, of which he ſoon after died. There was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a Skirmiſh between ſome of the French, and ſome of
our Battalions, between the Wood and that Farm which was
fired by the Enemy, but it did not laſt long; what Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they were I cannot tell; but 'tis ſuppoſed they were
ſome of the Dutch interlined in the Left Wing of Horſe,
commanded by Brigadier <hi>Fagel.</hi> The Van-guard being thus
diſordered for want of a timely Relief, which was occaſioned
by the narrowneſs of the Ground, and conſequently beaten
out of their Poſt in the Wood, <hi>Luxemburg</hi> being likewiſe
join'd by the Marqueſs of <hi>Boufflers</hi>'s freſh Troops, who came
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ime enough to compleat the Defeat of our Van-guard with
his Dragoons; and beſides, the Night drawing on, the King
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:62930:237"/>
ordered his Army to retreat, which was done with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Order; for tho' the French did follow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us for ſome time,
yet they did not fire a Shot, ſuch was the Order of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
that they did not dare venture upon it. The Engliſh
Granadiers brought up the Rear, and when-ever the French
moved towards us, they fac'd to the Right about, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
themſelves to the Enemy, then the Enemy would
halt, and ſo our Rear-guard marched on: This halting and
facing, and then marching, continued for ſome time, till the
Night put an end to the Enemies farther Motion. And thus
the Army came back to <hi>Hall</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning about
Three.</p>
            <p>We loſt in this Action ſeveral Pieces of Cannon, ſome ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Enemy, and ſome we could not bring off, the Horſes being tired; we likewiſe blew up ſome of our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Waggons
in the Retreat, which we could not bring off,
ſome having their Carriages broken, and others their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
tired. The Engliſh loſt two Colours, and the Dutch
likewiſe ſome. We had about 2000 Men killed, and about
3000 wounded, in which number we comprehend the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
taken by the French, diſabled by their Wounds to come
off, being about 8 or 900.</p>
            <p>Here it was that brave General <hi>Mackay,</hi> Sir <hi>John Lanier,</hi>
and divers other gallant Officers loſt their Lives: and ſurely
the French, notwithſtanding their <hi>Te Deum,</hi> for this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Victory, had nothing to boaſt of, ſince their Loſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Confeſſion of divers of their Officers, rather
exceeded that of the Confederates; and they had not come
of ſo cheap neither, had it not been for the Chevalier <hi>de
Millevoix,</hi> one of the Elector's Domeſticks, his having given,
and endeavoured to give further Intelligence to the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de Luxemburg</hi> of the King's Motion and Deſigns; for
which he was fairly hanged upon a Tree on the Right Wing
of Horſe. And now this Buſineſs is over, it is time we
ſhould come to the Particulars of <hi>Granvalle</hi>'s forementioned
Conſpiracy, as publiſhed in that time by Authority, and it
was briefly thus.</p>
            <p>Upon the 11th of <hi>Aug.</hi> the Sieur <hi>de Granvale</hi> was brought to his Tryal before a Court Martial at <hi>Lembeck</hi> for the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Conſpiracy, by him entred into againſt the Life of his
Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Where it appeared by Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
intercepted Letters, and other Authentick Pieces, that
ſome of the greateſt Miniſters in the French Court had
laid a Deſign to aſſaſſinate his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and
made Choice of <hi>Bartholomew Liniere,</hi> Sieur <hi>de Granvale</hi> for
their Inſtrument to manage the Enterprize, and find out fit
Perſons to aſſiſt him. To this purpoſe, <hi>Granvale</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that one <hi>Anthony du Mont</hi> had been formerly engag'd in
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:62930:238"/>
the ſame deſign by the Marqueſs of <hi>Louvois,</hi> when he was
living, propos'd it to him again by the order of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Barbeſieux,</hi> the Son of <hi>Louvois;</hi> upon which ſeveral
Projects were drawn up, and ſeveral Conferences held to
have brought it to paſs the laſt Campaign, 1691. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then diſappointed, they ſtill went on with their Deſign.
<hi>Granvale</hi> being employed to write to <hi>du Mont,</hi> then retir'd
to <hi>Hanover,</hi> and encourage him to a ſecond Attempt this
preſent Campaign. Soon after <hi>Granvale</hi> diſcover'd his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
to one <hi>Leefdale</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> who ſeem'd willingly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with him, but gave notice of it to his Friends in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that they might inform his Majeſty, as <hi>du Mont</hi> had
done to the Duke of <hi>Zell,</hi> who acquainted the King with
it. But <hi>Granvale</hi> knowing nothing of all this, departs from
<hi>Paris</hi> with <hi>Leefdale,</hi> gives <hi>du Mont</hi> a Meeting at <hi>Vden</hi> in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtein,</hi>
having in his way at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> imparted his Deſign to
one <hi>John d' Amours,</hi> and coming to <hi>Einchoven,</hi> was there ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and carried to <hi>Bois le Duc</hi> with his Companions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leefdale</hi> being firſt examined, declared all the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Conſpiracy; <hi>Granvale</hi>'s ſending <hi>du Mont</hi> 200 Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols the laſt Winter to keep him ſteady; and 10 Duckets
from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> by Bill of Exchange.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John d' Amours</hi> depos'd, That <hi>Granvale</hi> told him at <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi>
he had a great Buſineſs to do, and being asked what
it was, and whether he had any thing to ſay to the King
of <hi>England,</hi> he replied, To break his Neck; and that being
warn'd of the Difficulties of the Attempt, he anſwer'd, That
he had given his Word to the Marqueſs of <hi>Barbeſieux,</hi> and
would do it; and that he went into the Jeſuits Church at
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to ſay a <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> that God would bleſs his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.
<hi>Du Mont</hi> upon his Examination, own'd the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact in every Circumſtance; adding withal, That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Maintenon</hi> was acquainted with the Deſign; and that
he acquainted Monſieur <hi>Bedal,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Miniſter
at <hi>Hanover</hi> with it, who told him it would be a good Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
if it could be done, and lent him 50 Crowns for his
Encouragement. <hi>Granvale</hi> was the laſt examined, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Buſineſs diſcovered, and his own Letters ready to be
produced againſt him, confeſſed all the Circumſtances of the
Deſign. Upon this, <hi>Granvale</hi> was carried to the Army and
put upon his Tryal; upon which the Evidence appeared ſo
clear, that <hi>Granvale</hi> himſelf confeſs'd ſo much without nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Rack, that after the Judges had met ſeveral times,
they at laſt gave Sentence:</p>
            <p>That whereas <hi>Bartholomew de Liniere,</hi> Sieur <hi>de Granvale, a</hi>
Native of <hi>Picardy,</hi> had confeſſed before the Court Martial
without any Conſtraint; And it farther appeareth, that the
Marqueſs of <hi>Louvois,</hi> late Secretary to the King of <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:62930:238"/>
had agreed with <hi>du Mont</hi> about the Murder of King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi>
upon which the ſaid <hi>du Mont</hi> preſented the Marqueſs
with a Draught of the manner how it might be done. That
upon the Death of <hi>Louvois,</hi> his Son, and Secretary alſo to
the French King, the Marqueſs of <hi>Barbeſieux,</hi> revived the
ſaid Conſpiracy with <hi>du Mont,</hi> and paid him 30 Piſtols,
which his Father had order'd in his Life-time. That the
Priſoner came acquainted with <hi>du Mont</hi> at Monſieur <hi>Rebenac</hi>'s
Houſe, where Monſieur <hi>Paparel</hi> ſaying, That <hi>du Mont</hi> would
be a fit Perſon to carry off the King, <hi>du Mont</hi> replied with
Execrations, That he would carry off the King alive or dead,
as he had promiſed <hi>Louvois.</hi> That <hi>du Mont</hi> having delivered
the ſame or another Project to <hi>Barbeſieux,</hi> the Priſoner, to
prompt the Deſign, had had ſeveral Conferences with <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux</hi>
and <hi>Paparel;</hi> and being told, That he ſhould inform
<hi>du Mont,</hi> that the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> wore a Coat of
Mail, with which he acquainted <hi>du Mont, du Mont</hi> reply'd;
'Twas no matter, he would kill him for all that. That the
Priſoner was engaged with one <hi>Parker,</hi> a Colonel to the late
King <hi>James,</hi> to execute the ſame Deſign; and that the ſaid
<hi>Parker</hi> told him, he had laid the ſame Deſign with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Louvois.</hi> That the Priſoner, with the ſaid <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux,
Paparel, Parker,</hi> and <hi>du Mont,</hi> did agree upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of executing the Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> That he and <hi>Parker</hi> ſhould
meet at the grand Guard of the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who
was to furniſh him with 1500 Horſe, that <hi>du Mont</hi> was to
watch when the King of <hi>England</hi> went to Viſit the main
Guard, and there ſhoot him, and that the Priſoner and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
was to bring him off with the 1500 Horſe; and that
<hi>Barbeſieux</hi> gave the Priſoner an Order to the Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg</hi>
to ſupply him with ſuch a Detachment as he ſhould
think requiſite for the deſign. That the Priſoner by Order
of <hi>Barbeſieux</hi> received 80 Louidores from <hi>Paparel,</hi> and by
<hi>Barbeſieux</hi>'s Directions gave <hi>du Mont</hi> 55 out of the Summ.
That <hi>Barbeſieux</hi> promiſed the Priſoner an Annual Revenue of
20000 Livres, and to make him a Knight of the Order of
St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in caſe the deſign took Effect. That the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
took ſome meaſures in order to the deſign with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Chamlays,</hi> Quarter-Maſter General to the French King.
That in the mean time, <hi>Leefdale</hi> came acquainted with the
Priſoner by the means of one <hi>Sterck,</hi> and diſcover'd his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to him toward the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> 1692; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
carried him to <hi>Barbeſieux</hi> and <hi>Chamlays,</hi> who told
<hi>Leefdale,</hi> in the Priſoners hearing, That he ſhould have a
great Reward if the Buſineſs ſucceeded; and that <hi>Barbeſieux</hi>
and <hi>Paparel</hi> both knew of the Reward which was promiſed.
That the Priſoner, together with <hi>Leefdale</hi> and <hi>Parker,</hi> went
to St. <hi>Germains, April</hi> 16. 1692. to ſpeak with the late King
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:62930:239"/>
               <hi>James</hi> about the deſign, who knew of it before; And that
the Priſoner ſpake with the late King, the late Queen being
preſent; at which time King <hi>James</hi> told him, That <hi>Parker</hi>
had acquainted him with the Buſineſs, adding this farther,
<hi>If you and the reſt do me this Service, you ſhall never want.</hi>
That <hi>du Mont</hi>'s Wife delivered ſeveral Letters to <hi>Barbeſieux,</hi>
which ſhe receiv'd from her Husband at <hi>Hanover;</hi> where the
Priſoner continuing his Correſpondence with him, engaged
him by Letters of <hi>April</hi> 20, 25. and 12 of <hi>May,</hi> to meet him
at <hi>Vden</hi> in order to take their final Reſolution. That the
Priſoner with <hi>Chamlays</hi> and <hi>Leefdale</hi> agreed upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of perpetrating the Aſſaſſination; That when the King
ſhould paſs along the Lines, or ride out to take a View, or
when the Army ſhould decamp, that <hi>du Mont</hi> ſhould lie in
Ambuſh, and when the King came within 100 Paces, he
ſhould fire upon him; And that <hi>Chamlays</hi> ſhould be ready
with 3000 Horſe to bring him off. That the Priſoner and
<hi>Leefdale</hi> left <hi>Paris</hi> the 17th of <hi>April</hi> laſt, and arrived at <hi>Mons</hi>
within a few days after, where they waited for <hi>Chamlays;</hi>
but he not coming, they reſolved to ſet forward to the place
of the general Meeting; after which, the Priſoner with <hi>Leef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
were apprehended at <hi>Einhoven.</hi> All which being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely
examin'd and conſider'd, the Court Martial adjudg'd
the Priſoner Guilty, and condemned him to be drawn, hang'd
and quarter'd, his Eſtate to be confiſcate, and to bear the
Coſts and Charges of the Tryal. Which Sentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
in the Head Quarters of the Army, by the Earl of

Judge Advocates aſſiſting. In purſuance of which Sentence,
the Criminal was executed in the Camp upon the 13th of
<hi>Aug.</hi> Where all that he ſaid for himſelf was only to deſire
the Prayers of thoſe that were preſent. During his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
he drew up two Petitions to the King with his
own Hand; wherein he declared, That he acted in the
Deſign, in obedience to the Orders of M. <hi>Barbeſieux</hi> and
<hi>Chamlays;</hi> and being told that <hi>Barbeſieux</hi> would be ſure to
diſown what he ſaid, he replied, That he had an Original
Paper under <hi>Barbeſieux</hi>'s own Hand, which he had lodged in
a Friend's Hand, which would make it appear very plain;
but that his Friend would part with it to no body but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
The Morning before his Execution, he wrote to one
Madam <hi>Jure,</hi> to go to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> with

for a time at their Pleaſure, and obliged the Landgrave,
now weakned by the Detachment he had ſent away to the
Margrave of <hi>Bareith,</hi> and afterwards by another to ſecure
<hi>Heidelburgh,</hi> to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Eberemburgh:</hi> But for this,

which would have been of great Importance to them if they

the French were conſtrained to raiſe the Siege with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,

            <p>Having now run through the Efforts made by <hi>France</hi> on the Flemiſh and German ſide, it's time we ſhould ſee what was doing in reſpect to <hi>Savoy</hi> all this while. It's certain, there
were freſh Propoſals made to the Duke early in the Year
by M. <hi>Chanley</hi> in favour of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the <hi>Daupbinate,</hi> and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</note> but whether in the form

there was a Memoir printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein they ſet to
View all the Proffers that had been made to the Duke, tho'
the Aim of the Writing ſeem'd chiefly to inſinuate into the
Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Emperor had no other deſign, than
to make himſelf Maſter of their Territories, under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>retence
of aſſiſting a Prince, that had thrown himſelf into that Abyſs,
wherein he found him precipitated, with a great deal more
to the ſame purpoſe: But the German Troops now in <hi>Italy</hi>
were too numerous to give any of the Princes an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:62930:240"/>
to diſturb them, had they been ſo minded; and the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was yet too ſtanch to go back from his Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to his Allies, and therefore he appeared to carry on
this Campaign with more Vigour and Succeſs than at any
time before; but the truth on't was, the <hi>French</hi> were ſo ſtrong
in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> that all they deſired to do now in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi>
was to defend their Poſts, which they could not do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
For the Duke having got his Army into the Field, and
diſpoſed of ſeveral Detachments into the Vallies and other
places for the better ſecurity of the Country; he march'd in
the Month of <hi>July</hi> at the Head of 20000 Men into the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinate,</hi>
where, after they had pillaged <hi>la Roche, Chantelouve,</hi>
and ſome other Villages, they made themſelves Maſters of
the Caſtle and Highlands of <hi>Guilleſtre,</hi> and ſome other Paſſes;
and from thence moved towards the City of <hi>Ambrun,</hi> which
being ſurrendred upon Articles, the Day after having been
inveſted, on the 5th of <hi>Aug.;</hi> All the Army croſſed the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
at <hi>Guileſtre,</hi> and after a pretty brisk Siege of about 9
Days, was ſurrendred upon Articles. There the Duke found
20 Pieces of Cannon, and a Quantity of Proviſions; and the
City preſently granted to his Highneſs 40000 Livres Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
which they borrowed at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> for that purpoſe,
beſides which, his Highneſs ſeiz'd upon 60000 Livres in Gold,
which was the King's Mony in the Hands of the Treaſurer
of the Troops; all the <hi>Ambrunois,</hi> with the Neighbouring
Towns and Villages were at the ſame time put under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution.
From <hi>Ambrun</hi> the Army marched directly to <hi>Gap,</hi>
a City upon the Frontiers of <hi>Provence;</hi> before which Prince
<hi>Eugine</hi> no ſooner appeared, but it ſurrendred, and became
under the ſame Obligations of Contribution as the other
places; but tho' the Conſternation on that ſide of <hi>France</hi> was
incredible at this ſudden Irruption, and that the parts where
the Duke's Army came, were ſufficiently deſolated, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by the <hi>Germans,</hi> who are very good at <hi>Lextalionis,</hi> and
who, to make themſelves Satisfaction for the <hi>French</hi> Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
committed in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> utterly ruined all the places
they came near, ſo that upon Computation, there was no
leſs than 80 Caſtles, Boroughs, Towns, and Villages burnt
by them; yet the Duke's falling ſick of the Small Pox, and
the Diviſion among the Generals,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had been formed, of taking <hi>Brianſon</hi> and <hi>Quieras,</hi> to be put
in Execution, and ſo did incapacitate them to keep what had
been conquer'd in the <hi>Dauphinate:</hi> However to make the beſt
of a bad Market, they plundered the Country, deſtroy'd all
the Proviſions they could not carry away, got what Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
they could, burnt all that refuſed to contribute, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

Small Pox, he fell into an Ague which ſo rudely handled him,
that moſt Men deſpaired of his Recovery,<note place="margin">The Duke recovers.</note> but at length his
Youthful Conſtitution overcame it.</p>
            <p>Now it's time we ſhould take a turn into <hi>Hungary,</hi> where it will be found, that the Proceedings of this Campaign did not prove anſwerable to the Succeſs of the laſt. One-ſhould
think, that after ſuch an overthrow as that of <hi>Salankemen,</hi> the
<hi>Turks</hi> ſhould neither be able to bring any conſiderable Force
into the Field, and that the <hi>Germans</hi> could do no leſs than
take their former Road towards <hi>Niſſa</hi> or <hi>Widin,</hi> that leads to
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but neither of the two hapned, tho' the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
remained ſtill on the Emperors ſide; but it was more
owing to good Management, than the number of his Army.
Great <hi>Waradin</hi> had been block'd up in a manner for ſome
Years,<note place="margin">Great <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</note> but now the Imperial Court conſidering of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence

But his Anſwer was, That he reſolved to periſh in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

others periſhing with him; with which the General was ſo
incens'd, that he gave the Signal for Storming on the 2d of

beat a Parley,<note place="margin">Great <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radia</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered.</note> and the Articles of Capitulation were agreed

of the place on the 5th, where they found but little Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but great ſtore of Ammunition, with 77 Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
and 4 Mortars. This, I confeſs, was an important place,
but fell far ſhort of the taking of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> &amp;c. which the

and 'tis well, had they done that to purpoſe, for as to any
thing elſe, they never went about it: And now having run
thro' the ſeveral Tranſactions of <hi>Europe,</hi> it's time to cloſe this
Year with a few Particulars.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of the Year died the famous <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Death.</note> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was a Philoſopher under a particular Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as being addicted to the Study of Natural Philoſophy,
and perhaps never any Man dived ſo deep into the Knowledge
of Nature, as himſelf; which yet was ſo far from being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in him, with that Atheiſm, that is too too uſual for
ſuch ſpeculative Heads, that he was always in his Life time
eſteemed a very pious Man, and ſincere Chriſtian, of which
he gave a moſt convincing Teſtimony at his Death, by the
Legacy he left to have a Monthly Sermon preached againſt
Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>On the 7th of <hi>June</hi> hapned a moſt terrible Earthquake in the Iſland of <hi>Jamaca</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>

and not only ſo, but 'twas computed, no leſs than 1500

particularly in <hi>London,</hi> the like no Man living knew before,
but bleſſed be God, it did no harm with us, nor upon the

            <p>On the 24th of <hi>Dec.</hi> died the moſt ſerene Electreſs of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi>

undergone ſeveral Diſcompoſures from the 28th of <hi>Oct.</hi> when
ſhe was brought to bed of an Electoral Prince.</p>
            <p>This Year was alſo fatal to Prince <hi>Waldeck,</hi> Camp-Maſter-General to his Imperial Majeſty and the States, and on whom the Emperor conferred the Dignity of a Prince, by reaſon of
his Merit (for he was a Politick and Able as he was unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate)
and the Services he had done him in <hi>Hungary</hi> and
other places, but the ſame died with him.</p>
            <p>Neither ought we to forget,<note place="margin">Ninth Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorate.</note> that this Year the Duke of <hi>Hanover,</hi> a Proteſtant Prince, had been advanced to an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Empire, and ſo a Ninth Electorate conſtituted

            <p>The Fleet was numerous, and ready pretty early, as was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a great Fleet of Merchant-men, near 400 Sail in all, of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, Dutch, Hamburgers,</hi> &amp;c. prepared to ſail to the Streights
under the Convoy of Sir <hi>George Rook,</hi> with a ſtrong Squadron
of Men of War, with whom the grand Fleet was to keep
company, till they came to ſuch a Latitude, or as was given
out in thoſe times by ſome, till they had certain Information
where the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was; Which made their Orders diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary,

made Sir <hi>George</hi> have no more with him than 21 now; The
account of his Expedition, as himſelf ſent an Expreſs of it was
briefly thus: That indeed he had diſcovered the <hi>French</hi> Fleet
about 20 Leagues ſhort of Cape <hi>St. Vincent,</hi> which made him
call a Council of War, wherein it was reſolved, that the
Wind being freſh Weſterly, and giving a fair opportunity to
haſten their Paſſage to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> the Merchants ſhould make
the beſt of their way;<note place="margin">The <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd' by the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> That upon the Diſcovery of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
whole Fleet upon the 16th, he brought too, and ſtood
off with an eaſie Sail, to give what time he could to the
heavy Sailors, to work away to the Windward, ſending away
the <hi>Sheerneſs</hi> to order the ſmall Ships that were under the
Shore, that they ſhould endeavour to get along the Shore in
the Night, into <hi>Faro, St. Lucar,</hi> or <hi>Cadiz;</hi> That about 6 in
the Evening of the ſame Day, the <hi>French</hi> Admiral, and Vice-Admiral
of the Blue came up with the Leeward and Sternmoſt
of the Fleet, which were 2 or 3 <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War, who, as
we underſtood afterwards, fought firſt 11 and then 7 <hi>French</hi>
Men of War, but were forced at laſt to yield, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
being carried Aboard the <hi>French</hi> Admiral, he asked
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:62930:243"/>
               <hi>Schrycer,</hi> who was one of them, and fought moſt deſperately,
whether he was a Man or a Devil, and treated them both
very civilly. This made the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant-men that were
there, tack for the Shore, and the Enemy after them, which
gave a fair Opportunity to the Ships to Windward, and a
head to make ſail of; And this tacking after the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſaved
moſt of the Fleet; and the <hi>French</hi> accounts have exaggerated
the loſs we ſuſtained mightily, which indeed was too much:
But however it hapned with M. <hi>Tourville</hi> in the Management
of this Affair, I am ſure, if an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral had had ſuch
an opportunity over the <hi>French,</hi> and made no better uſe of
it, the Nation would never have forgiven him; for the loſs
in the utmoſt extent of it, was not reckoned above 32 Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-men
taken, and 27 burnt, and ſome of the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to Neutral Princes, and the greateſt Loſs that befel the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> was the ſinking of 4 of the greateſt Merchant-men in
the Bay of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> where it was hoped they were ſafe,
whereas the <hi>Danes, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. that put in there for ſhelter,
came off unhurt; and I have heard, the occaſion was, that
when a <hi>French</hi> Squadron came thither to bomb them, and one
of the firſt Bombs that was ſhot, fell into one of theſe <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Ships, this, tho' it did no conſiderable Damage, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it ſo terrified the Commanders, that they could think of no
way to ſave their Effects, but by loſing them, as I have told

ſeemed a Trial of Skill between both Armies, who ſhould
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:62930:243"/>
continue longeſt in their Poſts, which at length, on the 28th
of <hi>July</hi> the <hi>French</hi> were forced to quit, marching to <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſem</hi>
in their way towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> which gave the King
an opportunity to ſend a ſtrong Detachment under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> to force the <hi>French</hi> Lines
in <hi>Flanders.</hi> While he was putting this in Execution, with
very good Succeſs, and that Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> General of the
Troops of <hi>Leige,</hi> was marching with a Re-inforcement to
join the King, <hi>Luxemburg</hi> being advertiſed of it, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
poſted away ſome Troops to hinder that Conjunction, who
uſed that Celerity, that they in a manner ſurprized the
Count in the hollow ways thro' which he was marching, and
briskly charged ſuch of his Troops as they could come at;
but the Count making a Vertue of Neceſſity, ordered his
Men not to engage, but to retreat as faſt as they could, the
<hi>French</hi> purſuing them as far almoſt as <hi>Maeſtrich,</hi> to whom they
did no conſiderable Damage, ſave the taking of their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.
However, this Succeſs incouraged Monſieur <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
to lay ſiege to <hi>Huy,</hi> which was inveſted on <hi>July</hi> 9th,
and this made the King move nearer the Country of <hi>Liege:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Huy</hi> taken by the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note>
But when he came to <hi>Tongres,</hi> he was ſurprized to hear the
Caſtle of <hi>Huy</hi> had capitulated; which made him alſo, upon
further Information that Monſieur <hi>Luxemburg</hi> was drawn near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Liege,</hi> ſend 10 Battalions thither, who with very great
Difficulty got at length into the Place that now abſolutely
rejected the Neutrality <hi>Luxemburg</hi> offered; the Mareſchal
thereupon made as if he deſigned to attack it, but in reality
concluded to attack the King now encamped at <hi>Neerheſpen,</hi>
ſo much weakened thro' the ſeveral Detachments he made
to cover the places that ſeemed moſt in Danger, that it was
generally computed, the <hi>French,</hi> at the time of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
exceeded the Confederates at leaſt 35000 Men. The
King, to know the certainty of the Enemies Deſigns, before
he went further off from the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> ſent out daily ſome
Parties of Horſe to get Intelligence of the Enemy; one of
which returned, and gave him an Account, they could not
go beyond <hi>Waren,</hi> becauſe they met there with a great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>French</hi> Horſe; which indeed was the Left Wing of their
Army upon the March, which made the King, the Elector,
and other great Officers immediately to get on Horſeback
to inform themſelves better: And in ſhort, it was the
King's own Obſervation by the Enemies Countenance, that
'twas the Vanguard of the whole <hi>French</hi> Army that was
coming up to attack him in his own Camp; which made
him immediately draw up the Army <hi>in Battali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> to expect
the Enemy.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Enemy drew up by our Camp, the King ordered Brigadier <hi>Ranſey</hi> with his Brigade, then compoſed of <pb n="480" facs="tcp:62930:244"/>
5 Battalions, <hi>viz. Offerrel, Mackay, Lauder, Leven,</hi> and <hi>Monroe,</hi>
to the Right of all before our Right Wing of Horſe, to
guard ſome Hedges and hallow Ways which there covered
our Right juſt upon the Right of the Village of <hi>Laer.</hi> The
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> Battalions were poſted at this Village, and to
the Left of it, and more to the Left the Infantry of <hi>Hanover.</hi>
Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> as Major-General, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the 6 Battalions of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and Lieutenant-General
<hi>du Mont</hi> the <hi>Hanover,</hi> with whom he was to defend the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of <hi>Neerwinden,</hi> that cover'd part of our Camp between
the Right Wing of Horſe and our main Body. Theſe were
afterwards reinforc'd by the firſt Battalion of the firſt Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Guards, and the ſecond Battalion of Scotch Guards.
Upon the Left at <hi>Neerlanden</hi> his Majeſty order'd the firſt Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion
of the Royal Regiment, <hi>Churchill</hi>'s, <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s, and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawney</hi>'s,
Prince <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Battalion of <hi>Danes,</hi> and <hi>Fagel</hi>'s,
to poſſeſs this Village that covered the Left of our Body of
Foot, which upon the Enemies Approach wheeled from the
Left to the Right, to bring up their Left to the Brook of
<hi>Beck,</hi> where 'twas cover'd by this Village of <hi>Neerlanden.</hi>
The Ground was open between <hi>Neerwinden</hi> and <hi>Neerlanden;</hi>
whereupon his Majeſty order'd a Retrenchment to be made
in the Night from the one to the other, to cover our Body
of Foot, which indeed was but a ſlight Breaſt-work, as a
Man may judge by the time they had to make it, and the
number of Men that worked about it, <hi>viz.</hi> 30 Men <hi>per</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion;
and yet the French were pleaſed afterwards to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
it with the Name of <hi>A formidable Retrenchment,</hi> and
what not. Now the Remainder of the Body of Foot was
drawn up in one Line within the Retrenchment to defend
it; and the Dragoons upon the Left were ordered to the
Village of <hi>Dormal</hi> to guard that paſs upon the Brook of <hi>Beck;</hi>
and from thence the Left Wing of Horſe reached to <hi>Neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landen,</hi>
where 'twas covered by this Brook, and from thence
turned off to the Right behind the Body of Foot. However
it were (it was reported) <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> upon his Viewing of the
Camp that Evening, ſhould obſerve ſome Deficiency in it,
and ſay, <hi>Now he believed</hi> Waldeck <hi>was dead,</hi> who was known
to be perhaps the beſt Man for Encamping in the World.
The King who had been on Horſeback till late in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not only to give all the neceſſary Orders, but to ſee
the Execution of them, ordered his Coach at laſt to be
brought to the Rear of <hi>Stanley</hi>'s Regiment, where he repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
himſelf about two Hours; and early in the Morning
ſent for Doctor <hi>Menard,</hi> one of his Chaplains, into the Coach
to pray with him, ſuitable to the Occaſion; a rare Example
and worthy of Imitation by all, but eſpecially of Military
Men, who carry their Lives in their Hands, but more is the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:62930:244"/>
pitty, have uſually the leaſt Concern of any for a future
State; which was no ſooner done, but all things were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for Action. It was the 19th day of <hi>July</hi> this mighty
Battel was fought, which will be talked of in all future Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
and of which take the following Account.</p>
            <p>By Sun-riſing the French were drawn up within Cannon-ſhot of the Confederates Camp,<note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Landen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> who plaid upon them with their Cannon with good Succeſs; and this the French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with admirable Conſtancy, till about 6 they made
a Movement to come nearer the King's Retrenchments, and
about 8, <hi>Luxemburg</hi> ordered a ſtrong Body of Troops to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
the Villages of <hi>Lar</hi> or <hi>Neerwinden,</hi> which they did with
great Fury, and various Succeſs, having gained and loſt
thoſe Poſts once and again; But at length the Confederates,
tho' much inferiour in number, remained Maſters of them:
And here it was the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> was taken Priſoner.
But this ill Succeſs of the French upon the Confederates
Right, did not diſcourage them from Attacking the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
Left Wing at <hi>Neerlanden;</hi> which Poſt, tho' it was
not in it ſelf weak; yet it was attacked with a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
of Forces; and the Fire was very ſmart on both
ſides, the French gained and loſt the Advantage ſeveral
times; but were at laſt, after two Hours hot Diſpute, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
beaten: His Majeſty's Example and Preſence, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there in Perſon, mightily heartning the Confederates to
ſtand ſtoutly to it; and hitherto the Succeſs of the day was
manifeſtly on the Confederates ſide, and the French ſeemed
by their Countenance, as if they deſigned to draw off:
But <hi>Luxemburg</hi> having ſtill ſeveral Brigades of freſh Men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to gain the Village of <hi>Neerwinden</hi> a ſecond time;
and to that end, attacked it with great Fury, and here the
Diſpute laſted a long time; His Majeſty doing the Office of
a private Soldier, as well as a grand Captain, at the ſame
time; as did alſo the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf upon this Occaſion, by ſeveral Repulſes he gave
the Enemy: And in ſhort, nothing but Numbers prevailed
over the Confederates, who, together with the Field of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
whereon his Majeſty ſtaid rallying ſome Horſe, till he
was almoſt ſurrounded, loſt moſt of their Cannon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to <hi>Lewe</hi> unpurſued by the French, who, tho' they
gained the Battel, yet their Loſs was ſuch, that they might
very well ſay with <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> when compliment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon his Succeſs againſt the <hi>Romans, That ſuch another Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
would quite Ruin them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King in the Day of Battel ſhewed himſelf, as he had always done, a brave Man; and it was only the wonderful Providence of God that preſerved one that expoſed himſelf
ſo much as he did, who narrowly eſcaped 3 Musket-ſhots,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:62930:245"/>
one through his Perwig, which made him deaf for a while;
another through the Sleeve of his Coat, which did no harm;
and the third carried off the Knot of his Scarf, and left a
ſmall Contuſion on his Side; and in ſhort, his Majeſty this
day gained ſo far the Reſpect and Admiration of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that 'twas a common Saying among them, <hi>That they
wanted but ſuch a King to make them Maſters of Chriſtendom.</hi>
And the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> in his intercepted Letter to the
Princeſs his Wife, ſaid, <hi>He ſaw the King every where preſent,
where there was any Action, expoſing his Perſon to the greateſt
Dangers; and that ſurely ſo much Valour very well deſerved the
peaceable Poſſeſſion of the Crown he wore.</hi> It would be an endleſs
thing to enter into the Diſpute about the Loſs in this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
on each ſide; the Confederates indeed thought theirs
at firſt much greater than afterward upon a Review it did
appear, when they miſſed not above 5 or 6000 fighting
Men, killed, wounded and taken Priſoners; whereas the
French would have them to be no leſs than 20000, and theirs
2000 killed: But here the Confederates might juſtly turn
the Tables; For it is paſt all doubt the French had above
the number of 2000 Officers killed and wounded; and if
the Allies did ſomewhat exaggerate the Loſs of the French,
in computing it at about 18000, yet ſurely <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s not
purſuing them at all upon the Retreat, and his continuing
for 15 days together at <hi>Waren,</hi> without making the leaſt
Attempt, gave a conſiderable Reputation to what they ſaid.
But for their Cannon and Mortars, the Confederates muſt
be content to own they loſt the greateſt part of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the French, to give ſome Reputation to their Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in what they ſaid in relation to the Battel, did at laſt
reſolve to beſiege <hi>Charleroy,</hi> which they inveſted on the 31ſt
of <hi>Aug.</hi> after they had been reinforced with the Troops from
the Sea-Coaſt, and a great Detachment, under <hi>Boufflers,</hi> from
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which confirmed ſtill their Loſs as aforeſaid. It
is not my purpoſe to give a Journal of the Siege, it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſay, That the French, with theſe new Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
attacked the Place with great Fury, which was as well
defended by the Beſieged, that tho' they had little or no
proſpect of Relief, yet they gallantly held it out till the 1ſt
of <hi>Oct.</hi> and then made an honourable Capitulation; and in
truth, this was the only place that made a brave Defence
in <hi>Flanders</hi> ſince the War, and afforded no Suſpition of any
Treachery in the Surrender of it.</p>
            <p>But tho' <hi>Charleroy</hi> was the only Garriſon the Spaniards loſt in <hi>Flanders</hi> ſo late in the Year,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charleroy</hi> beſieged and ſurrendred to the French.</note> and for the ſaving of which, they themſelves were ſo far from being able, that
their Allies in Conjunction with them, had not been able
to effect it, yet they were no better provided in <hi>Catalonia,</hi>
               <pb n="483" facs="tcp:62930:245"/>
where the French, ſo early as the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> inveſted
<hi>Roſes</hi> both by Sea and Land, and carried the Siege of it on
with that forwardneſs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Roſes</hi> taken.</note> that on the 5th of <hi>June</hi> the place was
ſurrendred to them. I do not find they made any great Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
to enlarge this Conqueſt on that ſide, neither would
the Spaniards give them any further Opportunity at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
but it had been well, had they timely enough thought
this to be too much, and ſo prevented it, but it's in vain
to talk, they will have their faſhion, and ſo we leave them
and ſee what is done in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Germans</hi> were ſo ſlow, and the <hi>French</hi> ſo forward, that the latter paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Phillipsburg,</hi> and without any Oppoſition on the 18th of <hi>May,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milli</hi>
with 2000 Men inveſted <hi>Heidleburg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heidelburg</hi> taken and deſtroyed by the French.</note> which had been
long threatned by them, and the Duke <hi>de Lorge</hi> croſſed the
firſt Mountains with 30000 Men to oppoſe the Prince of
<hi>Baden,</hi> that this Year commanded upon the <hi>Rhine;</hi> but was
not yet in any condition to act, but defenſively, and hardly
that, ſo that poor <hi>Heidelburg</hi> was to ſhift for her ſelf, and
God knows, that was done but ſorrily: For beſides its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
otherwiſe, there was ſuch a Diviſion between the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and the Townſmen, about the Money that was called
in, and which they would have go Current again; that when
on the 19th, the Regiment of <hi>Sconbeck</hi> was ready to enter
the Town to re-inforce the Garriſon, the Townſmen were ſo
incenſed againſt the Soldiers, that they oppoſed the Entrance,
which gave <hi>Melac</hi> an Opportunity to ſeize a Redoubt, from
whence he could batter the back-part of the Works of the
Town; and in ſhort, the French on the 21ſt entred the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs
with little Oppoſition, and their Granadiers drave the
beſieged with ſo much haſte to the Caſtle Gates, that they
left above 600 of their Soldiers without, who were all put
to the Sword: The Governour of the Caſtle fearing the ſame
Deſtiny, ſent a Capuchin with Propoſals to <hi>de Lorge,</hi> which
the other was ſo far from admitting of, that he prepared
for an Aſſault, which the Governour finding, he accepted of
the Offers made him by the French, and on the 2d, the
Garriſon, to the Number of 1200 Men, 2 Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
and 12 Waggons laden with Baggage were conducted
to <hi>Wimpel:</hi> But the Burning of the City and Caſtle of
<hi>Heidleburg</hi> by the French, and other Barbarities committed
in the <hi>Pala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inate,</hi> let others relate them that will, I have no
Stomach to them. Fluſh'd with this Succeſs, M. <hi>de Lorge</hi>
advanced towards the <hi>Neckar,</hi> with a deſign to attack the
Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> who was encamped on the other ſide of the
River, over which the French laid 2 Bridges in order to paſs
it, but they were ſo warmly received by the <hi>Germans</hi> both
here and afterwards at <hi>Wimpſen,</hi> where they attempted the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:62930:246"/>
ſame thing, that they were forced to quit the Enterprize,
and come off with the Loſs of near 1000 Men. Some time
after this,<note place="margin">The Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attack the Prince of <hi>Baden.</hi>
               </note> the Dauphine joined the Army, which was near
70000 ſtrong, and finding the Paſs of <hi>Zwingenberg</hi> would be
of great Advantage to them, they took the ſaid Caſtle by
Storm, after they had routed ſome Parties without, and a
very hot Diſpute from within, with its ſmall Garriſon, who
yet found a way to eſcape: This with other petty Succeſſes,
and their greatly out-numbring the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> in Men,
made the Dauphine deſirous to attack him in his Camp near
<hi>Flein;</hi> wherefore, tho' he knew how advantageouſly he was
intrenched, yet on the 26th of <hi>July</hi> he croſſed the <hi>Neckar,</hi>
and advanced within 4 Hours march of the Prince, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
re-called all his Detachments to ſtrengthen himſelf, and
ſo much the more, ſince he had certain Advice on the 31ſt,
That the Dauphine reſolved to give him Battle, and that he
would fall on the next Morning. In ſhort, the French advanced
the ſame day with all their Cavalry and 4000 Granadiers,
and having raiſed ſome Batteries, ſet themſelves to work, to
force the Entrenchments, and encompaſſed the Left Wing of
the Camp, which made the Prince ſend a Detachment of
Horſe into the Valley of <hi>Winsburg</hi> to diſpute the Paſs with
them, and when about 2 he thought the French would have
begun the Fight, they drew off and re-paſſed the <hi>Neckar</hi> with
ſome Loſs. Neither was there any other thing of Moment
done there this Campaign, ſave the French putting a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
into <hi>Stugard,</hi> and raiſing a very little Contribution-money
(tho' they had ſuch a ſtrong Belief that the Dauphine
would engage the Prince, that publick Prayers were put up
for his Preſervation every-where) ſo that after he had ſent
the fore-mentioned Detachment under <hi>Boufflers</hi> to the Siege
of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> and another into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he returned in the
Month of <hi>Aug.</hi> to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> with which we ſhall leave <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and ſee what has been doing in <hi>Piedmont</hi> this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>It was indeed time to open the Campaign, when the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was quite recovered of his long Indiſpoſition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention was made laſt Year, and then he joined the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which was conſiderably ſtrong, and made the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the <hi>Dauphinate</hi> fear a worſe Irruption into their
Country than the laſt, and to begin to provide for their
Safety accordingly: But the Deſigns of the Confederates
ſeemed to drive the French firſt out of <hi>Italy,</hi> by diſpoſſeſſing
them of <hi>Cazal</hi> and <hi>Pignerol,</hi> neither of which was effected:
'Tis true, <hi>Cazal</hi> was block'd up for ſome time, and the Fort
of St. <hi>George</hi> taken by Storm, which compleated the Blockade
of that Place, but things went no further; And the Duke,
with the main Army, laid Siege to <hi>Pignerol,</hi> took the Fort of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:62930:246"/>
St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> that covered it, after the Loſs of above 1500
Men, and ſuch an obſtinate Defence on the Beſieged's part,
that after all, it was made a doubt, whether they ſhould
carry on the Siege of the Town or Bomb it: All this took
up ſo much time, that <hi>Catinat</hi> being reinforced with more
Troops, and particularly with the foreſaid Detachment from
<hi>Germany,</hi> found himſelf in a Condition to act Offenſively,
and therefore he deſcended into the Plains; and this ſeeming to
the Duke as if he had threatned <hi>Turin,</hi> he drew off from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Pignerol,</hi> and encamped at <hi>Marſiglia.</hi> The Conſequence
whereof we'll give you in the following Letter, written

His Royal Highneſs, and under him the Count <hi>de Caprara,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Right Wing, which was covered by the reſt of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majeſty's and his Royal Highneſs's Cavalry. In the Right
Wing, and the <hi>Corps de Battaille,</hi> was poſted the Foot of his
ſaid Imperial Majeſty, of his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and of
his Royal Highneſs. The <hi>Corps de Battaille</hi> was commanded by
Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had under him the Marqueſs <hi>de
la Parelle,</hi> and the Count <hi>de las Torres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Army being diſpoſed in this order, march'd on <hi>Saturday</hi>
the 3d into the Neighbourhood of <hi>Orbaſſan,</hi> from whence we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Enemies Army towards the Hills, between <hi>Orbaſſan</hi>
and <hi>Pioſaſque:</hi> The Enemy ſeeing us thus advanced, made a
ſhew of moving to us in order of Battel; but the Night coming
on, the two Armies marched off to a greater diſtance from each
other, to ſuffer the Troops to repoſe themſelves. At Midnight
we ſent away all the Baggage, and put our ſelves into a Poſture
to receive the Enemy, who we perceived by the Ground their
Army took up, were much more numerous than we. At break of
day the Enemy advanced towards us, making uſe of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
they had in the Ground, which was full of Woods and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards.
They threw ſome Dragoons into the Village of <hi>Pioſaſque,</hi>
ſituate upon a Hill, to cover their Right Wing, and began to play
all their Artillery upon our Left Wing, which did us ſome Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:62930:247"/>
But our Cannon being likewiſe very well poſted, and well
ſerved, did great execution among their Cavalry. About half an
hour after Eight, they fell upon our Left Wing with about 20000
men, without firing a Shot, having their Bagonets at the end of
their Fuſils, and their Swords in their Hands, but they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed
and driven back with great vigour: They renewed their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack,
and took in Front and Flank the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> and <hi>Milaneze</hi>
Horſe, who after having courageouſly withſtood the Fury of the
Enemy, were at laſt over-powered by their Numbers, and puſhed
upon the <hi>German</hi> Horſe; who being thereby put into diſorder, and
being at the ſame time charged by the little Gendermerie, were no
longer able to keep their Ground, and fell upon the Infantry, which
was put alſo into Diſorder. The ſecond Line being brought on to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
the Enemy, while the firſt Line rallied, the Horſe gave way,
by which means the ſaid ſecond Line not being able to withſtand
the Efforts of the Enemy, was obliged to give ground likewiſe.
But while things paſſed thus in our Left Wing, the Enemy were
thrice repulſed with great loſs by our <hi>Corps de Battaille,</hi> and our
Right Wing; and we had all along the Advantage on that ſide, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Enemies Horſe which had made our Left Wing give way,
attack'd our Infantry behind and in Flank, who had no longer any
Horſe to cover them on their Left, and were at the ſame time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
by the Enemies Foot. Our Troops reſiſted them with extra-ordinary
Courage, made their Cavalry give way by the means of
our Cannon, (which was employed to very good purpoſe) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed
them with a great Effuſion of Blood. This Reſiſtance and
Effort of our Horſe in the Right Wing, quite diſheartned the
Enemy, but they being 10000 Men ſtronger than we, and receiving
a farther Reinforcement, attacked our Troops anew; So that being
environed by their Cavalry, and very much fatigued, and without
hopes of being ſuccoured by our Horſe, we were obliged to retire
at Four in the Afternoon, leaving the place of Battle to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
with 10 or 12 Field-pieces, the reſt being ſaved. Orders
were given for our Troops to rally at <hi>Moncalier,</hi> where in the
Evening moſt of the Foot paſſed the <hi>Po.</hi> Laſt Night and this Day
a great many Soldiers came hither; the Enemy did not make the
leaſt ſhew of purſuing us. All the Troops fought very well, and the
Action was very ſharp on both ſides. The Troops of his Majeſty of
<hi>Great Britain,</hi> which were in the <hi>Corps de Battaille,</hi> did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
diſtinguiſh themſelves, and the Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> who
commanded them, fought on foot at the head of his own Regiment,
and would not take any other command. The Count <hi>de las Torres</hi>
deſired him, after the Enemies third Attack, to take upon him the
Command, and cauſe a Retreat to be made by the Foot of the <hi>Corps
de Battaille</hi> and the Right Wing, which had not yet ſuſtained any
great damage; but the Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> told him, That it was
neceſſary firſt to have his Royal Highneſs's Order, and until it came,
they would bear the Enemies Fire; adding, That he found things
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:62930:247"/>
were gone ſo far, that they muſt now overcome or die. The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the ſaid Duke is to be greatly admired; he had the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be wounded in the Thigh; one of his Serants who waited
upon him in his Chamber, ſaved his Life; for he ſeeing the Duke
fall run to him, and called for Quarter, but before he could be
heard, was killed upon the Spot. The Duke at the ſame time was
taken Priſoner, but Monſieur <hi>Catinat</hi> ſent him back upon his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role,
and he arrived here this Day. I had already deſired a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of his Royal Highneſs (who came hither yeſterday about 5 in
the Evening) to go and demand him. I cannot yet exactly tell your
Lordſhips how many are killed on our ſide. 'Tis thought that the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops have ſuſtained the greateſt loſs. The Regiments
of his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> have likewiſe ſuffered very much,
and there is not a Third of them left. Of the Regiment of <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi>
18 Officers are taken, many of which are mortally wounded,
and of the others proportionably. We have yet no News of Collonel
<hi>Montauban: l'Iſle Marais,</hi> Lieutenant-Collonel is taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
The Baron <hi>de Viskoute,</hi> Lieutenant-Collonel of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> is alſo taken and wounded: <hi>De Loches,</hi>
Lieutenant-Collonel, is kill'd or taken, with ſeveral Captains. There
are 3 or 4 Captains of the Regiment of <hi>Miremont</hi> killed; Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Monbrun</hi> has 4 dangerous Wounds, his Major is killed, and
his Lieutenant-Collonel is killed, or Priſoner. Of the Troops of
his Royal Highneſs, the Marquiſs <hi>de la Suſe</hi> Lieutenant of his Life-Guards,
is killed; the Count <hi>de Chalaus,</hi> Collonel of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Mondovi,</hi> is likewiſe killed. Of the Troops of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majeſty, the Prince <hi>de Comerci</hi> is wounded in the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the Son of the Count <hi>de Palfi</hi> killed. The Enemies loſs
is at leaſt as great as ours, and 'tis only to their Numbers that
the Victory is to be attributed. We have of their Priſoners, Col.
<hi>Montrevel,</hi> Quarter Maſter-General of the Horſe; the Marquiſs
<hi>de Montmorenci</hi> Colonel, and other Officers, as well as a great
many private Soldiers. We have likewiſe taken divers Colours,
Standards and Kettle-Drums, and, except in the Left Wing, the
Victory was on our ſide to the laſt. The Troops (who are moſt
of them again rallied) have Orders, part of them to ſtay at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calier,</hi>
and the reſt to encamp before this City. The Enemy have
not made any motion ſince their Victory, and are ſtill in their
Camp; they have only burnt ſome Houſes about <hi>Bainaſco.</hi> This
Day was brought hither from <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> by the <hi>Po,</hi> the heavy
Artillery that was made uſe of againſt <hi>Pignerol.</hi> We apprehended
the Enemy would have ſent a Detachment thither before it was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd.
All the Baggage which was likewiſe ſent from <hi>Villa Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
is come to <hi>Moncalier.</hi> As I am cloſing my Letter, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that Col. <hi>Montaubon</hi> is arrived with about 500 Horſe, which
he rallied and brought from <hi>Villa Franca</hi> along the <hi>Po,</hi> to cover
the Artillery I juſt now mentioned.</p>

But while <hi>France</hi> was thus Triumphing every where over
the Confederates, ſhe felt a moſt dangerous Enemy within
her own Bowels, that ſwept away a multitude of her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
which was <hi>Famine,</hi> which for all the Care the King
could take, made the Face of the Kingdom look with a moſt
ghaſtly Countenance, and which, with ſomething elſe, made
her pretty early make Propoſals of Peace to the Emperor,
that in themſelves were not contemptible: But it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to disjoin him from his Allies; and therefore find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it would not do that way, it was given out then, and I
am apt to believe it was ſo, or raiſed with an Intention that
it ſhould be ſo; That new Propoſals of Peace were made to
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Empire,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by which it was offered to reſtore all the
Places taken ſince the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> and withal, to
ſurrender ſome as they were then fortified. But whatever
there was in it, the Event ſhew'd it came to nothing.</p>
            <p>And now having in a manner done with the Affairs of the Allies and <hi>France,</hi> we'll ſee a little how the Emperor and his Confederates have fared with the <hi>Turks</hi> this Campaign. As
for the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> they were ſo far from doing any
thing memorable in their reſpective Stations againſt the
<hi>Inſidels,</hi> that the former, inſtead of favouring the Deſigns of
the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and keeping tight to their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
ſeemed inclinable, as was ſuppoſed, by the Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the King of <hi>France,</hi> to clap up a Peace with the
Port: And, to make ſuch a Diſingagement the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Embaſſador at <hi>Vienna</hi> made ſome odd Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
by way of Complaint, to the Emperor, the Purport
whereof we can no otherwiſe give, than by the Anſwer his
Imperial Majeſty made in theſe Words:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>HIS Sacred Imperial Majeſty, our moſt gracious Lord, by the Relation humbly made to him, has been acquainted with the Propoſals made to his Imperial Miniſters at the Conference upon
the 8th of <hi>May</hi> laſt, by the moſt Serene King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Embaſſador, the Lord <hi>Samuel Proski,</hi> Knight of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
and Commendador of <hi>Poſonia;</hi> and firſt with a deep Senſe of
Gratitude he acknowledges the Glorious Inclination of your Royal
Majeſty to carry on, and indefatigably continue this Sacred War, and
that Succour ſo ſeaſonably afforded at the Siege of <hi>Vienna.</hi> Which,
nevertheleſs, in the moſt prudent Judgment of your Royal Majeſty,
was deemed more advantagious and more neceſſary than any other
Expedition for the Preſervation and Security of the Kingdom of
<hi>Poland</hi> it ſelf. However, his Imperial Majeſty conſiders it as a
Kindneſs ſolely conferred upon himſelf, and ſhall to perpetuity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cain
the Memory of it; moſt ardently wiſhing, that the ſame Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
may never ſo nearly threaten the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> and
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:62930:248"/>
more eſpecially <hi>Craccovia,</hi> the Metropolis of it; yet faithfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
himſelf to be moſt ready upon all Occaſions, even with the
Hazard and Detriment of his Provinces, to repay the ſame Aſſiſtance
and Favour, according to the Claim of mutual Confederacy, as has
not only been formerly granted by him in the moſt deſperate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Affairs, at what time the ſaid City, with
the Effuſion of much Blood, was ranſom'd to the Kingdom, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are living yet to remember, but what he has the Satisfaction
to prove, not only by the Teſtimony almoſt of all the World, but of
his own Conſcience; that is to ſay, That in the preſent War he has
not fail'd in any Duty of a Sincere Friend, a Neighbour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate.
Wherefore, though that ſame unexpected, and ſo little
deſerved, yet ſo plain an Accuſation has been laid to his Charge,
wherein for ſo many and much greater Acts of Royal Fraternity,
as the Lord Embaſſador alledges, no reciprocal regard has been had
to the Demands of the moſt Serene King, but that he could enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate
many, and thoſe not ordinary Specimens of moſt Cordial Love,
Friendſhip, and Good Will: Nevertheleſs, though ſuch Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
diminiſh rather the Merit of the Benefit, than augment
the mutual Correſpondencies of Friendſhip; his Imperial Majeſty
ſetting thoſe aſide, has commanded ſeveral Anſwers to be given to
the reſt of the Heads of the Lord Ambaſſador's Propoſitions.</p>

            <p>But whether this, or ſomewhat elſe, gave the K. of <hi>Poland</hi>
full Satisfaction, or that ſome other Accident diverted that
Crown from proceeding in the ſeparate Negotiation of a
Peace with the <hi>Turks,</hi> there was little more heard of it. But
which way ſoever things ſtood with the Imperial Court in
relation to their Allies, they were not a whit daunted; but,
after having carried the Fortreſs of <hi>Jeno</hi> in <hi>Vpper Hungary,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the beginning of the Summer they made all things
ready to beſiege <hi>Belgrade.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> had the chief
Command of the Imperial Army this Year, who, towards
the latter end of <hi>July,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Belgrade</hi> beſieg'd by the <hi>Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</hi>
               </note> inveſted the Town; but the Trenches
were not opened till the 13th of <hi>Aug.</hi> at Night, which were
carried on towards the Counterſcarp, the Beſieged the ſame
Day making a numerous Sally, as they did alſo on the 17th,
but were repulſed both times with conſiderable Loſs; as they
were alſo the two following Days upon the ſame occaſion;
while the General, in the mean time, ordered a ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of Horſe and Foot to go and lay a Bridge over the
<hi>Danube,</hi> and to raiſe 5 Forts on each ſide the River, to ſtop
the Enemies Fleets. On the 21ſt they began to build the ſaid
Bridge, from whence, as well as from the Imperial Fleet, they
play'd furiouſly upon that of the Enemy, while they carried
on their Trenches within 100 paces of the Counterſcarp, and
finiſhed a great Battery, on which they planted 32 Cartouches,
and ſome other Pieces of Cannon, which being on the 25th
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:62930:249"/>
reinforced with 10 Mortars, they battered the Place next
Day with extraordinary Vigour and good Succeſs, and ſo on
till the 27th, when the Fort, on which the <hi>Turks</hi> had planted
Cannon, from whence they play'd with great Fury on the
Beſiegers, was utterly ruined; And this encouraged the latter
to work hard on a Battery, which they had begun to raiſe
on the Left Hand, to ruine the Out-works of the <hi>Turks</hi> on
that ſide; and though the <hi>Turks</hi> made ſtout Reſiſtance, and
made no leſs than 14 Mines, 11 of them were diſcovered,
and the Beſiegers diſcontinued their Works till they had found
the other 3, which yet did not diſcourage the <hi>Turks,</hi> who
hourly expected Relief to come up. Of this the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi>
were ſenſible alſo; ſo that on the 31ſt of <hi>Aug.</hi> a Council of
War was held, and Two Expreſſes ſent away, one to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Veterani,</hi> and the other to Colonel <hi>Kiba,</hi> with Orders for
the latter to march with all the Men under his Command
near <hi>Minoviza,</hi> for the Security of that River; and in the
mean time the Siege went on, and on the 7th of <hi>Sept.</hi> a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Aſſault upon the Counterſcarp was reſolved on: But
all things not being ready till it was late, though the Attack
was made with wonderful Bravery, the <hi>Turks,</hi> who had in the
mean time Intelligence of it, and had made Proviſion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
made ſuch an obſtinate Defence, that, what with that
and the Darkneſs of the Night, they failed to carry it.
Whereupon the General, underſtanding the Grand Viſier
with 80000 Men was marching up, it was, on the 10th, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in a Council of War to raiſe the Siege;<note place="margin">The Siege rais'd.</note> which was
done accordingly, and the Retreat made, without ſo much
as the Loſs of one Man, though the Enemy failed not to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
them: The Grand Viſier, having thus gained his Point,
ſat down contented, without undertaking any Enterprize:
And ſo the Campagne terminated without any other Action,
ſaving that the Ban of <hi>Croatia</hi> was ſaid to have taken a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Town in <hi>Boſnia,</hi> which I do not find named any
where; and that the Count of <hi>Heiderſheim</hi> routed a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

I Am always glad to meet you here;<note place="margin">The King his Speech to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> and I could heartily wiſh
that Our Satisfaction were not leſſened at preſent, by Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
upon the Diſadvantage We have received this Year at Land,
and the Miſcarriages in our Affairs at Sea. I think it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the former was only occaſioned by the great Numbers
of our Enemies, which exceeded Ours in all Places. For what
relates to the latter, which has brought ſo great a Diſgrace upon
the Nation, I have reſented it extreamly: And as I will take
care that thoſe who have not done their Duty ſhall be puniſhed;
ſo I am reſolved to uſe My Endeavours, that Our Power at Sea
may be rightly managed for the future. And it well deſerves
Our Conſideration, Whether We are not defective, both in the
Number of Our Shipping, and in proper Ports to the Weſtward,
for the better Annoying our Enemies, and protecting Our Trade,
which is ſo eſſential to the Welfare of this Kingdom.</q>
            <q>My Lords and Gentlemen,
I am very ſenſible of the good Affection wherewith you have
always aſſiſted Me, to ſupport the Charges of this War, which
have been very great: And yet I am perſwaded, that the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of this Summer is ſufficient to convince Vs all, That to
arrive at a good End of it, there will be a Neceſſity of encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Our Forces, both by Sea and Land, the next Year. Our Allies
have reſolved to add to Theirs: And I will not doubt, but you will
have ſuch regard to the preſent Exigency, as that you will give Me
a ſuitable Supply to enable me to do the like. I muſt therefore
earneſtly recommend it to you, Gentlemen of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
to take ſuch timely Reſolutions, as that your Supplies may
be effectual, and Our Preparations ſo forward, as will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
both for the Security, and the Honour of the Nation.</q>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons quickly came to an unanimous Reſolution to ſupport Their Majeſties; and likewiſe ſhewed a good Diſpoſition to comply with the King's Deſires, in the
Increaſe of his Forces, both by Sea and Land: But, at the
ſame time, they did not forget to ſpend ſome time in the
Examination of the Miſ-carrying of the <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="492" facs="tcp:62930:250"/>
of Opinion, that there had been a notorious and treacherous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management
in that Affair.</hi> But it is great pity the Rogues

<hi>Bembow</hi>'s Bombing and Burning ſome part of St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes</hi>
about this time, gave ſome ſort of Contentment to Mens
Minds, tho' it was no Reparation of the Loſs. With this
Action we ſhall cloſe up the Year, on the laſt day whereof
the brave Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> landed at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> from
whence he went to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and thence to <hi>Kenſington,</hi> to

fell out, Sir <hi>Francis Wheeler</hi> was Admiral of the Squadron of
Men of War, who, with the Fleet of Merchant Ships under
his Convoy, ſailed on the 17th of <hi>Febr.</hi> from <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

               <hi>Sunday,</hi> about 10 in the Morning, there aroſe ſuch a violent
Storm, with Thunder and Lightning, and great Rain, that
hardly any Man in the Fleet ever ſaw the like; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
all that Day, and the following Night, the Wind
blowing at E. and E. N. E. ſo that upon <hi>Monday</hi> the 19th,
about 5 in the Morning,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Francis Wheeler</hi> loſt</note> Sir <hi>Francis Wheeler</hi>'s own Ship, the
<hi>Suſſex,</hi> was founder'd, and all her Men, except two <hi>Moors,</hi>
were loſt; and the Admiral's Body was, on the 21ſt, found
on a Sand-Bank, near <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> in his Shirt and Slippers;
which made People believe, that he, ſeeing himſelf in ſuch
imminent Danger, had ſtripped off his Clothes, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to ſave his Life by ſwimming. But tho' the Loſs was
already too great, it had been well if it had ſtopped here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But, alaſs! the <hi>Cambridge, Lumley-Caſtle,</hi> (Men of War) the
<hi>Serpent</hi> Bomb-Ketch, and the <hi>Mary</hi> Ketch, together with the
<hi>Italian-Merchant,</hi> the <hi>Aleppo-Factor,</hi> the <hi>Great George,</hi> and the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:62930:250"/>
               <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> bound for <hi>Turkey;</hi> the <hi>William</hi> for <hi>Venice;</hi> and the
<hi>Golden-Merchant,</hi> for <hi>Leghorne,</hi> all Engliſh, were driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar,
and loſt, on the E. ſide of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and moſt of the
Men drowned; As were alſo 3 Dutch Ships, of good Value:
But Reer-Admiral <hi>Neville,</hi> with 2 Dutch Men of War, had
the good Luck to be blown out of the <hi>Streights,</hi> and put ſafe
into <hi>Cadiz,</hi> as the reſt of the Fleet did on the 19th into <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar,</hi>
to repair the Damages they had ſuſtained in the
Storm.</p>
            <p>But tho' this Loſs was heavy in it ſelf, yet, God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it did not ſo affect the Nation, but that they went chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on ſtill with their Buſineſs. The finiſhing of our Men
of War upon the Stocks was puſhed on with great Diligence:
And the Parliament loſt no Time in their Work neither;
for, beſides the new Levies ordered to be made; by the 23d
of <hi>March,</hi> they had, among other Bills, paſſed one, <hi>To grant
to their Majeſties certain Rates upon Salt, Ale, Beer, and other
Liquors, for Securing certain Recompences and Advantages to ſuch
Perſons as ſhould voluntarily advance the Summ of</hi> 1000000 l.
<hi>toward carrying on the War.</hi> And then the King having told
them how forward the Enemy was, and what Neceſſity there
was of their being ready to meet them, both by Sea and
Land, he earneſtly recommended to them the Diſpatch of
thoſe important Affairs they had ſtill under their Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and proteſted to them, he had nothing ſo much at
his Heart, as the Eaſe and Happineſs of his People; and that
it was with great Reluctancy he was forced to ask ſuch large
Supplies from them; but their preſent Circumſtances made
the ſame unavoidable. Neither was it long before His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Expectations were fully anſwered, for in <hi>April</hi> the
following Acts, among others, were ready for his Signing,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Act for Raiſing Money by a Poll,<note place="margin">Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſigned.</note> payable Quarterly, for one Year.</p>
            <p>An Act for granting to their Majeſties ſeveral Rates and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon Tunnage of Ships and Veſſels; and upon Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, for Securing certain Recompences and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to ſuch Perſons as ſhould voluntarily advance the Summ of
1500000 l. towards carrying on the War againſt <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Act for Granting to their Majeſties ſeveral Duties upon Vellom, Parchment and Paper, for 4 Years. <hi>And alſo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Act for Licenſing and Regulating Hackney and Stage-Coaches.</p>
            <p>This was no ſooner done, and that the King had thanked them for the great Proofs they had given him of their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions this Seſſion; and his acquainting them with the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
there was of his being abſent for ſome time, out of
the Kingdom, but the two Houſes were Prorogued to the

18th of <hi>Sept.</hi> following. And ſo we leave them, and his
Majeſty, for the preſent, going to make the Campaign in
the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> and ſee a little what the Conſequence was
of the mighty Preparations for Sea which we had been
making all this Spring.</p>
            <p>But tho' our Fleet was ſo early out this Year, they were neither able to block up that of <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Breſt,</hi> nor to come at them to fight them at Sea, than which, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
deſired nothing more; and the French as much declined
it, ſo that they would firſt venture a Caper into the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi>
(whither they actually went) rather than hazard a
Battel. But the Truth of it is, they had concerted ſuch
vaſt Deſigns againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> both by Sea and Land, this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
that, had it not been for our Fleet's going into thoſe
Seas, I cannot ſee what could have hindered the French to

any harm, tho' they continued throwing Bombs from all the
places before-mentioned, till 10 at Night.</p>
            <p>While the whole Fleet was thus preparing to come to an Anchor, the Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> in his own Galley, taking ſeveral other Perſons along with them,
ſtood in a conſiderable way into the Bay; and after they
had gained a good View of it, and got out again without
any Damage, tho' warmly fired at by <hi>Camaret</hi>-Fort, they
returned, and gave the Lord <hi>Berkeley</hi> an Account of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the Bay, and the Situation of the Caſtle, which was
very advantageouſly placed, to defend the Landing-places,
againſt any that ſhould attempt to ſet Footing on Shore.
Thereupon it was thought convenient, that the <hi>Monk</hi> of 60
Guns, and the <hi>Diamaten</hi> of equal Force, ſhould go in for
that purpoſe. But the Marqueſs, who had viewed the
Place, not believing that thoſe two Men of War would be
ſufficient to cover the Boats, at their Landing, from the
Shot from the Fort, nor to aſſiſt the Land-Forces, at their
Landing, by playing upon the Enemy, who were better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
and more numerous, than was expected; and ready
to be ſeconded, upon all Occaſions, with 14 Squadrons of
Horſe, all regular Troops, ſo far as they could diſcern by
their Habit: Therefore, upon the 8th, after a Conſultation
of the Engliſh and Dutch Flags, and the General-Officers of
the Land-Forces, it was reſolved, That 6 more Men of War
ſhould be added to the 2 former, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Greenwich,</hi> of 54
Guns; the <hi>Charles</hi>-Galley, of 32; the <hi>Shoreham,</hi> of 32; the
<hi>Darkenſtein,</hi> of 44; the <hi>Weſep,</hi> of 30; and the <hi>Wolf</hi> of 30
Guns: All which the Marqueſs undertook to poſt, ſo as
to bear upon the Caſtle to the beſt Advantage, and to
perform thoſe other Services for which they were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>This was a Work of great Labour, Difficulty, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for no ſooner was the <hi>Monk</hi> come within reach of the Enemy's Mortars, but the Enemy began to fling their Bombs
at her from Point <hi>des Fillettes,</hi> and the Weſtern Point of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maret</hi>-Bay;
inſomuch, that when ſhe came within 3 Quarters
of a Mile of the latter, one of the Bombs broke juſt over
her, and a great piece of it ſtriking through her Poop, and
two Decks more, flew out again into the Water, near one
of the Stern-Ports, and killed 2 of the Marqueſs's Marine
Company, and wounded a third, who ſtood cloſe by him, on
the Poop.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as ſhe got into the Bay, and came up a-breſt with the Weſtern Point, <hi>Camaret</hi>-Fort fired thick and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold at her; and ſhe being forced to ſtand with her Stern
right upon it, the Shot from thence raked her fore and aft,
and did her a great deal of Damage. More than this; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:62930:252"/>
all the Ships were got pretty well into the Bay, they
were ſurprized with three Batteries more, all firing upon
them, which they never perceived till they felt their Shot.
But, notwithſtanding all theſe Difficulties, the Marqueſs
made a ſhift to poſt the 8 Ships in ſuch a manner, as gave
great Succour to the Land-Forces, and did the Enemy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Miſchief: For theſe Ships, ſo ſoon as they had drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
their Anchors in the Bay, fired continually upon the
Enemy, and forced the French to run twice out of <hi>Camaret</hi>-Fort.</p>
            <p>From theſe Ships it was eaſie to perceive the Enemy very advantageouſly entrenched at every place where there was any poſſibility of Landing, and great Numbers of Foot drawn
behind the Trenches.</p>
            <p>On the Other ſide, Lieutenant-General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> with a ſmall Number of Well-boats, went a-ſhore in a confuſed manner, under a little Rock on the South-ſide of the ſmall
Bay. Nor was there any Proſecution of that regular Way of
Landing which the Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> propoſed, and had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on.</p>
            <p>Here his Lordſhip excuſes himſelf, for not being able to give an Account of what paſſed cloſe by the Shore; and goes on, That when he ſaw the Boats and ſmall Veſſels, in which
the Land-Forces were embarked, had made their Retreat
from thence, excepting ſuch as ſtuck faſt, wherein a great
many were killed, and taken Priſoners, and the Signal given
to bring off the Ships, he applied himſelf to undergo the
greateſt Difficulty he had in all the Action; for that all their
Rigging was cut in pieces, and moſt of their Sails and Yards
diſabled. The <hi>Shoreham,</hi> not ſo much diſabled as the reſt,
got clear out of Danger, with little Aſſiſtance: But it coſt
the Marqueſs a world of Labour, and hard Venturing, to
get off the reſt; but more eſpecially the <hi>Charles</hi>-Galley, and
the <hi>Monk,</hi> that was within half her length of daſhing againſt
a Rock, as having no other Motion but what the Sea and
Tow-boats afforded her: But at length, he being indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
in his Labour, and undaunted in his Courage, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
what he undertook, and brought of all clear but the
<hi>Teſep,</hi> a ſmall Dutch Man of War, of 30 Guns, which he
found with 12 Foot Water in her Hold, and all the Men kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that were left with the Lieutenant, but himſelf, a Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and one Man more.</p>
            <p>As for the Loſs ſuſtained at Sea, his Lordſhip acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges 400 Men loſt in the 3 Engliſh and 4 Dutch Ships, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command. As for the Loſs of the Land-Forces, he
ſays, he was not acquainted with it; But the Report was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That the Killed, Wounded, and Taken, amounted to about
700 more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="497" facs="tcp:62930:252"/>
But what Error ſoever, that brave Man Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Talmaſh</hi> might have committed in his Landing, he paid
very dear for it with the loſs of his Life, as did I doubt, a
much greater number of Men killed and wounded, than my
Lord talks of in his unfortunate Expedition, which for my
part, I think could not be otherwiſe than ſo; ſince the French
by ſuch ſtrong Works, Batteries, and great Forces, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſo much Precaution to defend themſelves againſt this
Attempt (of which, and the place of Landing, they had, no
doubt, timely information enough) which they could not well
be without, ſince it was no ſecret in <hi>England,</hi> but a Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talk
at this time, that <hi>Breſt</hi> was the place we deſigned to
Land at.</p>
            <p>But how unſucceſsful ſoever we proved in this Expedition,<note place="margin">The death of the Prince of <hi>Liege,</hi> and Choice of another.</note>
the King had managed his Affairs ſo well, both at home
and abroad this Seaſon, that he began now to beard the
French, and this ſince the beginning of the War, was the
firſt time they ſeemed to be upon the decline in <hi>Flanders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Its true, the Death of the Biſhop and Prince of <hi>Liege,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the beginning of this Year, gave the French a mighty
Proſpect to imbroil the Affairs of the Confederates on that
ſide: For as the Death of the Elector of <hi>Cologn</hi> in 1688, and
the Conteſts between the Empire and <hi>France,</hi> in the two
Perſons of Prince <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Furſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
gave the firſt Occaſion to the Flame of this War to
break forth in <hi>Germany,</hi> that ſoon after by divers concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Accidents, ſpread it ſelf over the Face of almoſt all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
So if the French could have got the Cardinall <hi>de Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villon,</hi>
to have been advanced into the Principality of <hi>Liege,</hi>
they did not doubt but to have brought the Confederates to
be more humble, and to have accepted of the Conditions of
Peace, the French King would allow them, but this did not
happen neither. For notwithſtanding all <hi>Bovillion</hi>'s Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the major part of the Chapter firſt made Choice of
the Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> and the other of the Grand Maſter of
the <hi>Tutonick</hi> Order, to be their Prince and Biſhop, both
which ſent to the Emperor and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> about it;
and this was as likely to imbroil the Confederates Affairs, as
any thing that had yet hapned, the laſt named of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates
or Princes Elect, being no leſs than Brother-in-Law
to the Emperor, who we might reaſonably ſuppoſe would
eſpouſe his Cauſe with all the Intereſt he had, as the other
was Brother to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> who beſides his own
Intereſt that was conſiderable, had, 'twas generally believed,
that of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland</hi> on
his ſide. But while things hung thus in ſuſpence, and that
particularly both Parties were expecting the Deciſion of the
See of <hi>Rome,</hi> Heaven decided the Conteſt in an unexpected
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:62930:253"/>
manner, by the Death of the Grand Maſter, of a certain
contagious Diſtemper, that had for ſome time been riſe in
the City of <hi>Liege,</hi> and ſo the Elector of <hi>Cologn</hi> in ſome time
after got the peaceable Poſſeſſion of the Principality, which
together with the great Power of the Confederates in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
made things look with an ill Aſpect upon the Affairs
of <hi>France.</hi> For the Confederate Army now under the King's
Command, encamped at Mont St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> where they all
joined,<note place="margin">The Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </note> amounting in Horſe and Dragoons to no leſs than
31800 Men, all very well Mounted and Armed; and of the
Dragoons, more eſpecially it may be ſaid, that ſuch a Body
either for Number, or the good Order they were in, has
hardly ever been in the Field, and in Foot to 51000, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a Body of about 7000 Men, under the Command of

inferiour in Number, yet the <hi>Dauphine</hi> uſed all his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to decline Fighting, and the King put him hard to it,
ſo that the French Army was in a manner couped up by
him for a time, under the Walls of their Garriſon of <hi>Huy,</hi>
and reduced to conſiderable ſtreights, where we ſhall leave
them and the Confederates in their reſpective Camps, and
where they continued while the Engliſh Fleet in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
were Bombing the Maritime-Towns of <hi>France,</hi> to the

that ſet the Houſes on Fire in ſeveral places, ſo that the
Townſmen, not knowing whither to run, and deſpairing to
quench it, took a fright and began to run away in Diſorder,
which made the Marqueſs of <hi>Bearon</hi> ſend 2 Battalions of the
Militia of <hi>Bretaign</hi> to encourage the Inhabitants, but the
Diſorders were ſo great, and the Fire ſo terrible, that the
Soldiers fled with the reſt: So that if the Confederates had
known what had paſſed, they might in all probability have
poſſeſt themſelves of the Place; however they ſo ruin'd it,
that there was hardly a Houſe left unſhattered, but the
greateſt part were intirely reduced to Aſhes. From hence the
Fleet allarming all the Coaſt, ſailed towards <hi>Havre de Grace</hi>
where on the 26th, about 3 in the Afternoon, they bega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at theirs at Mont St. <hi>Andre,</hi> yet being not able poſſibly
to ſubſiſt there any longer, he reſolved to decamp firſt, and
though he thought to have concealed his deſign, by ſending

before him on the 8th of <hi>Aug.</hi> and ſoon gained the Poſts
of <hi>Picton,</hi> where there was not Forrage for above 4 days, and
being informed of the Enemies March, moved towards <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>

Baking of Bread at <hi>Ghent</hi> and <hi>Aeth.</hi> On the 12th, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

Detachment of Horſe and Foot, with ſome Pieces of
Cannon, went to poſſeſs themſelves of a Poſt upon the <hi>Scheld,</hi>
and the Army followed on the 14th, with an intention to have
paſſed the River at <hi>Pont Eſpeires:</hi> But tho' the Confederates
made great haſte to get thither, the French made more to
prevent them. For on the 15th, the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
having advanced towards <hi>Pont de Eſchaie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> with a numerous
Detachment, in order to attack the Paſſage of the River, he
found the French to the number of 30000 Men, entrenched
on the other ſide up to their Teeth, ſo as that he did not
think it convenient to proceed. But that haſty March of
the French, coſt them more Men and Horſes than they have
been willing to own they had loſt in ſome of their Battles.
However, it muſt be ſaid it was a buſineſs that was worth
while to hinder the Confederates to enter into French <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
where if they had once done ſo, they would in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
together with ſome important Conqueſt, have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
ſome Winter Quarters at leaſt; Beſides other loſſes
that would almoſt inevitably have followed: And this the
French King was ſo ſenſible of, that he writ a Letter, with
Orders for the reading it at the Head of the Army,<note place="margin">The French King his Letter to the Army</note> wherein
he returned thanks in the firſt place, to the Princes of the

with that of the Guards, and acknowledged how much

upon all Occaſions, that ſame Teſtimony of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and deſired a continuation of it.</p>
            <p>But as the French did not a little Triumph, they had warded this Blow; the King was reſolved they ſhould not always have occaſion to do ſo, and therefore finding the
Enemy very intent to watch his Motion in a new ſeat of War,
he laid hold of the Advantage, and in purſuance of it, the
Prince <hi>Serclas de Tilly</hi> paſſed the <hi>Meuſe</hi> at <hi>Thilen,</hi> with all the
Horſe and Dragoons of the Dioceſs of <hi>Liege,</hi> being followed
by a party of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Horſe, and ſome Battalions of

arrived 16 Regiments of Foot,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Huy</hi> beſieged by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates and taken.</note> with the Duke of <hi>Holſtein
Ploen,</hi> who was appointed to Command the Siege. The
Place was no ſooner inveſted on both ſides the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> but the
Town ſurrendred to the Confederates, and by the 19th of
<hi>Sept.</hi> the Batteries were raiſed againſt the Caſtle, and the
Artillery that conſiſted of 60 Pieces of Cannon, and 30 Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
came up when the French made a Sally upon Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Cohorn</hi>'s Quarters, in hopes to have taken 3 Field-pieces,
but they were repulſed with loſs, and ſo the Works went on
briskly till the 21ſt at Night, when the Beſieged opened their
Trenches. Theſe they carried on with great Vigour, till
that on the 24th, in the Morning, the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> under-Officer
of the Regiment of <hi>Anhault,</hi> mounted the Counter-ſcarp
of Fort <hi>Piccard,</hi> at the head of 15 Soldiers only, and
that with ſo much Courage and Bravery, that they killed
the few French that were there, threw a Tunful of Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
into the Water, and took away a Barrel of Powder and
ſome Arms, which he brought into the Camp; And all
this in the ſight of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen,</hi> and other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
who were ſo ſatisfied with his Bravery, that the <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi>
General immediately wrote to the Elector, to deſire
him to beſtow a Captain's Place upon the young Officer.
The Beſiegers the ſame day continued firing upon the Caſtle
and two Forts, both which laſt were taken by 700 <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers</hi>
by dint of Sword, who in the heat of their Fury,
put 150 French to Death, but gave Quarter to 70 others
that were moſtly wounded, and all this with the loſs only of
20 Men; So that being fluſh'd with Succeſs, they puſhed on
the Siege of the Caſtle with wonderful Vigour, wherein they
had made a conſiderable Breach, and had all things ready
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:62930:254"/>
for an Aſſault by the 27th, when the Governour beat a
Parly, and the Articles were ſoon agreed on, whereby the
Garriſon was to be convoy'd into <hi>Namur,</hi> which was done
accordingly, and the French thereby totally expelled out of
the Dioceſs of <hi>Liege, Dinant</hi> at that time being accounted a
part of <hi>France.</hi> Thus ended the Campaign in <hi>Flanders,</hi> not
very pleaſing to the French, tho' perhaps, all Circumſtances
conſidered, with leſs diſadvantage than themſelves expected;
however, they made amends for it to purpoſe in <hi>Spain,</hi> as
has been already hinted, and of which we ſhall now briefly
run over the Particulars.</p>
            <p>The French Army,<note place="margin">The French Progreſs in <hi>Catalonia.</hi>
               </note> under the Command of the Mareſchal <hi>de Noailles,</hi> being about 30000 ſtrong, and conſequently, much ſuperiour to the Spaniards, and very early in the Field
to boot, arrived on the 26th of <hi>May</hi> on the Banks of the
River <hi>Ter</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which notwithſtanding they found the
Spaniards intrenched on the other ſide, they reſolved to paſs;
and having, to that end, ſounded all the Fords that ſame
Evening, they forced their way through, after about half
an Hours Diſpute, and conſtrained the Spaniſh Foot to quit
their Retrenchments without any great Reſiſtance: But the
Cavalry ſhewed a more than ordinary Valour and great
Conduct in their Retreat, which they performed in the beſt
manner they could to cover their Foot; yet this could not
prevent the loſs of their Baggage; though what with the
Defence the Horſe made, and the Narrowneſs of the Ways,
the French made no far purſuit. However, this point of
paſſing the <hi>Ter</hi> was enough gained for them to beſiege <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamos,</hi>
a Town by the Sea-ſide, about 22 Leagues from <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona</hi>
to the S. E. which was inveſted on the 30th of <hi>May,</hi>
and by the 2d of <hi>June</hi> at Night the Trenches were opened,
and the Works carried on a good way, though not without
Diſturbance both from the ſmall Shot and Cannon of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged,
which killed a great many Men; and next Day they
made a Sally, at firſt with good Succeſs, but they were at
length repulſed, and ply'd cloſe with Mortars and Cannon
both by Sea and Land, ſo that by the 7th in the Morning
all things were in a readineſs to attack the Covert-way:
This the Granadeers did with great Fury, and were ſo far
from loſing time to make Lodgments, that they puſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and finding a way to enter at two Breaches, where
only one could paſs in Front, they entred the City, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it, and put all they met to the Sword; and of thoſe
that were ſaved, all were made Priſoners of War: Only
part of the Officers that were moſt wounded were ſent to
<hi>Gironne</hi> upon their Paroles; <hi>Not only,</hi> ſaid Monſieur <hi>Noailles</hi>
in his Letter, <hi>becauſe they ſeemed to deſire it, but becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
the Terror that would ſtrike among the Soldiery and People.</hi>
               <pb n="502" facs="tcp:62930:255"/>
And what he ſaid was true enough; for the Spaniards quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
withdrew their Garriſon out of St. <hi>Felix Quinola,</hi> and the
Caſtle of St. <hi>Elme;</hi> and though they pretended to make a
ſtout Reſiſtance at <hi>Gironne,</hi> a well-fortify'd City, that <hi>Noa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lles</hi>
had actually laid Siege to by the 19th of <hi>June;</hi> Yet
they could ſcarce hold it for 10 Days, for they ſurrender'd
the Place on the 29th of the ſame Month, and that upon
very ignominious Terms too. For the Garriſon was to
march out without Cannon, and the Cavalny, except 10 in
a Troop, to march away on Foot with the Infantry without
their Horſes, and all the Ammunition and Proviſion to be
left behind in the City. This being effected ſucceſsfully, the
next thing was to attack <hi>Oſtralick,</hi> a little City upon the Road
to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which they quickly maſtered without any great
Reſiſtance, and thereby enlarg'd the French Territories 20
Miles in extent. But the Army, becauſe of the violent
Heats, beginning now to be ſickly, they went into Quarters
of Refreſhment upon the Banks of the River <hi>Terdera,</hi> which
is a very plentiful Country, and full of Fruit-trees, and
where they continued in a manner as unmoleſted from the
Spaniards, as if they had been in the middle of <hi>France.</hi> But
it was not ſo with the Spaniards on the part of the French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for after they had refreſhed themſelves, they bethought of
taking in <hi>Caſtle Folet,</hi> a Town a little to the W. of <hi>Gironne,</hi>
which they took, having firſt routed a Body of Country Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
that came to relieve it, and made the Garriſon Priſoners
of War. But tho' the Spaniards thought to profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of this Opportunity, by re-taking <hi>Oſtralick,</hi> which they
actually beſieged with 4000 Foot and 1500 Horſe, and had
reduced it to that Condition, that the Governour was up
on Articles of Surrender, and Hoſtages were given on both
ſides; yet ſo fatal was the Slowneſs of this People to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in inſiſting that the <hi>Miquelets</hi> ſhould be Priſoners of
War; that the Governour, in the mean time, having notice
that <hi>Noailles</hi> was marching to his Relief, redemanded his
Hoſtages, and refuſed to ſtand to the Articles; ſo that the
Siege was immediately raiſed. But by this time the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Fleet, and ſuch an one as thoſe Seas never ſaw before,
was arrived in the <hi>Streights</hi> under the Command of Admiral
<hi>Ruſſel,</hi> as much to the heartning of the Spaniards, who
ſeemed before to have given all for loſt in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> as it
was a Mortification to the French, who did not expect any
ſuch thing;<note place="margin">The French Fleet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to <hi>Thoulon.</hi>
               </note> and now ſaw their Error in ſending their Grand

both on the Ocean as well as the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> ſide unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

to ſlip by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral, yet he quickly found the
other had ſo ſharp an Eye upon him, that he was forced to
return to his Port again, and reſt contented to lie in Souce
there for the reſt of the Winter; from whom at preſent we

who, believing, they would fight, went on to meet

<hi>Wiſelock,</hi> paſſed the <hi>Neckar,</hi> burnt the Town of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi>
and ruined the Flat Country; which ſo incenſed the
Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> that, though he were not yet reinforced by
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> yet he advanced to <hi>Wiſelock,</hi> a Poſt near which
there happened a ſharp Rencounter between a Detachment
of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> wherein the former loſt near 300
Men, and the latter near half the number, but withal gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

time, but that they had poſted themſelves the beſt they
could, in order to obſerve one another; till at length the
Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> impatient of Action, reſolved in his turn
to croſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and to that end ordered the Marqueſs of

and poſſeſſed himſelf of divers ſmall Places, and all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

were, that the <hi>Germans</hi> now would either force the <hi>French</hi>

on that ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> or at leaſt compleat the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

that almoſt came, was their repaſſing the <hi>Rhine</hi> again, which,
was ſaid, was chiefly occaſioned by the great Rains that fell,
which very much endangered the breaking down the Bridges
the Prince had laid over that River: However, they made a
ſafe Retreat, brought away with them 14000 Head of Cattle,
deſtroyed a vaſt quantity of Forage in the Country, and
ſome Magazines of the <hi>French,</hi> which put an end to the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's

            <p>There is little to be ſaid of the Affairs of <hi>Savoy</hi> this Year;<note place="margin">The Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne in <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </note>
for though the Duke abſolutely rejected the Propoſals made

or would do little or nothing now in the Field, where the

as far as <hi>Brianſon,</hi> we have nothing to ſay of the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
For though it was expected on all Hands they would have

doubted of, yet all that was done was the taking the Fort
<hi>St. George,</hi> and thereby further ſtraitning that Place, of
which Siege you ſhall hear more next Year. Neither were
there any great matters done in <hi>Hungary;</hi> for though the
<hi>Turks</hi> were conſiderably ſuperiour to the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who were this Year, as the laſt, commanded by General
<hi>Caprara,</hi> yet all that ever the Grand Viſier could do, could
not force their Camp near <hi>Carlowitz,</hi> nor deſtroy their Fleet;
ſo that the Grand Viſier, upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt and 2d of <hi>Octob.</hi> drew
off his Camp, having ſent away his Artillery and Baggage
before, and left only ſome few Carriages, Hutts, and other
things of little Value behind them. But becauſe the Reaſons
of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Retreat give the beſt Account of the Principal
Paſſages that happened during their Attempt upon the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts,</hi>
they are theſe that follow:</p>
            <p>1ſt, Becauſe a Detachment of <hi>Huſſars,</hi> from the Garriſon of <hi>Titul,</hi> being out upon a Party, towards the <hi>Danube,</hi> near <hi>Salankemen,</hi> intercepted 20 great Boats, laden with Meal, and
other Proviſions, together with a Frigat that convoyed them;
and conſtrained ſeveral other Barks to row back to <hi>Belgrade</hi>
as faſt as they could: They killed above 100 Men in the Ren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
counter, and forced 100 more into the River, where they
were either drowned, or taken Priſoners, of which Number
was an Aga; together with ſeven Colours: So that the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Army had been ſeven Days in great Want.</p>
            <p>2dly, For that it having rained for three Days and five Nights, the <hi>Turks</hi> Approaches were very much endamaged, and the Janiſaries ſo diſcouraged, by ſtanding up to the middle
of the Leg in Water, and for want of Victuals, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to work any more.</p>
            <p>3dly, Becauſe the Grand Viſier having, by his continual Importunities, obliged the Cham of <hi>Tartary</hi> to ſend a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Detachment of his Horſe to the other ſide of the <hi>Danu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
that Detachment had been vigorouſly repulſed by the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts,</hi>
under Major-General <hi>Baſſompierre;</hi> So that the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
were conſtrained to flee, part on this ſide the <hi>Danube,</hi>
and the reſt on the other ſide of the <hi>Theyſſe,</hi> with the Loſs of
Sultan <hi>Galga</hi>'s Son, and 500 more killed, beſides thoſe that
were drowned in the two Rivers, and they who periſhed in the
adjoining Mariſhes: So that of 7000 Men, of which that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:62930:256"/>
conſiſted, but very few returned to the Camp; they
that eſcaped to the other ſide of the <hi>Theyſſe,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Sultan <hi>Galga,</hi> and had taken the Road to <hi>Temeſwaer,</hi>
not exceeding the Number of 2000.</p>
            <p>4thly, Becauſe that upon this ill Succeſs, the Cham had fallen out with the Grand Viſier, upbraiding him with lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men to Slaughter; declaring, that he would no longer
act under him, but return home with all his Forces.</p>
            <p>5thly, Becauſe that while the <hi>Ottomans</hi> held the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi>
and the Fortreſs of <hi>Waradin</hi> in a manner beſieged, they had
loſt above 15000 Men, partly killed, and partly dead of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>6thly, Becauſe that the <hi>Arnauts,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Tartars</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to march off, began to talk of returning home in like manner.</p>
            <p>7thly, Becauſe that ſeveral of their Galleys and Saickicks were ruined by the Batteries of the <hi>Imperialiſts.</hi>

of forcing the <hi>Imperial</hi> Camp, of deſtroying the <hi>Danubian</hi>

and ſo both ſides betook themſelves to their Winter-Quarters.
But tho' the <hi>Turks,</hi> in reſpect to the <hi>Germans,</hi>
were no Loſers this Campaign, it being well enough that the
latter could ſtand their Ground; yet it was not ſo in reference
to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who, tho' they loſt towards the beginning
of the Year, their Captain-General and Doge <hi>Moroſini</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting

yet they ſeemed as forward as ever in their Warlike Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
having made Choice of Signior <hi>Zeno</hi> for Captain-General,
while General <hi>Steinau</hi> commanded their Land-Forces
in the <hi>Levant.</hi> But the firſt Progreſs of their Arms
was in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> where, about the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

and played upon the 2 Towers that ſecured the Bridge,
they were preſently ſurrender'd to him: And on the 17th,
being joined by the Horſe, he attacked the Town it ſelf with
much Fury, and by the 21ſt was in full Poſſeſſion of it:
Wherein he found 1700 Barrels of Gun-Powder, and 18

to re-inforce, made ſuch an obſtinate Defence, that the <hi>Turks,</hi>

a Siege of 9 Days, which the Intelligence that the Chevalier
<hi>Bolizzo</hi> held in the Place did not a little facilitate; yet this
was nothing to the Conqueſt of the Iſland of <hi>Scio,</hi> where the
<hi>Venetians</hi> landed on the 7th of <hi>Sept.</hi> under the Command of
General <hi>Steinau,</hi> without any great Oppoſition; and often
having made themſelves Maſters of all the Poſts within a
Mile round the Place, upon the 9th they ſeized upon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs
nigh the Caſtle, containing about 2000 Inhabitants.
Next Day they began to batter the Caſtle with 4 Pieces of
Cannon and 4 Mortars, with that Succeſs, that the Place
was ſet on fire in ſeveral parts; and having the ſame Day
ſeized upon the Fortreſs that ſecures the Haven, and took
the Arſenal, not far off, together with three Galleys, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Bey of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> with divers Merchant-ſhips
that lay in the Harbour, they ſpent the next two Days in
carrving on their Approaches, and ſucceeded ſo well, that
on the 14th they ſprung a Mine deſigning to blow up the
Counterſcarp; which, tho' it wrought not that Effect that
was expected, Yet the hideous Noiſe it made, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

accordingly: And tho' the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet appeared the next

went, they declined ſighting, and retired. But, after all, this

who, early this Year, gave his Maſter an Account,
that the Cham of <hi>Tartary</hi> had made him new Propoſals for

was, <hi>That the King of</hi> Poland <hi>would never break his Alliance

who died of the Small Pox, at <hi>Dreſden,</hi> on the 7th of <hi>May,</hi>
towards Evening, when it was thought he was out of Danger,

when they parted laſt; yet ſomething quickly happen'd that
reduced our Advantages ſo contemptibly little, that we were,
in a manner, left diſconſolate, and next to Deſpair: And
what could that be, alas! but the Death of the beſt of Queens,
the beſt of Wives, nay, the beſt of Women, our moſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Sovereign Lady, <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of <hi>Great Britain, France</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which happen'd on the 28th of <hi>December,</hi> at her

of the Small-Pox. To attempt her Character would be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
in me, ſince it has been done ſo well by ſo many

I have heard, His Majeſty, who knew her beſt, was pleaſed
to make the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> when he went to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him for his great Loſs, <hi>That he could not chuſe but grieve,

are apt to paſs over untouched, That ſhe was certainly a
Princeſs of real Piety, which I ſhould not ſay, if I had not

known ſome Circumſtances my ſelf concerning her, upon
that Account, that were evident tokens of it. Wherefore I
ſhall end this unhappy Year with the Parliament and Nation's
Condolance of the King, upon this great Loſs, as himſelf
was pleaſed to expreſs it; and their Proteſtations to ſtand
by him, againſt all Opponents whatſoever, both at home
and abroad. And the Truth of it is, if ever Addreſſes were
real and unfeigned, they were thoſe made upon this Occaſion,
ſince it has been obvious to any Man of Obſervation, that
that ſad Providence did very much heighten Men's Affections
to His Majeſty's Perſon; which being before, as it were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

            <p>An Act for Granting 4 s. in the Pound to His Majeſty: And for Applying the Yearly Summ of 300000 <hi>l.</hi> for Five Years, out of the Duties of Tunnage and Poundage; and other Summs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

little favourably, as if it had been a Confirmation of their

obliged to acquieſce, and the Lovers of the Government to
go on with the King's Buſineſs. But it was the middle of
<hi>April,</hi> or thereabout, before there were any more Mony-Bills
ready; when His Majeſty ſigned, among divers others,</p>
            <p>An Act for enabling ſuch Perſons as had Eſtates for Life in Annuities, payable by ſeveral former. Acts therein mentioned, to purchaſe and obtain farther and more certain Intereſts in ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities:

            </p>
            <p>And then he was pleaſed to tell them, that the ſeaſon of the Year was ſo far advanced, and the circumſtances of affairs ſo preſſing, that he very earneſtly recommended unto them the
ſpeedy diſpatching of ſuch buſineſs, as they thought of moſt
importance for the publick good, becauſe he was to make
an end of the Seſſions in a few Days, which was done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the ſigning of ſome other Bills, which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had diſpatched, and among the reſt; An Act to grant
unto the King, certain Duties upon Glaſs-wares, Stone and
Earthen Bottles, Coal and Culm, for carrying on the War
as before. Then it was that he told them, the neceſſity there
was for his Preſence abroad, but that he would take care to
have the adminiſtration of Affairs, during his Abſence, put
into ſuch Perſons hands, on whoſe care and fidelity he could
entirely depend, and that he doubted not, but they both
Lords and Gentlemen in their ſeveral Stations, would be
aſſiſting to them, and that what it was he required of them,
was to be more than ordinarily vigilant in preſerving the
publick Peace. In purſuance to this His Majeſties Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

after his uſual Divertion, went on the 27th of <hi>May</hi> from <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
to <hi>Ghent,</hi> where the Inhabitants made great preparations

they owed to ſo great a King, and the Protector of their
Country, and could not have done more to their own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had he come among them. But
though the King ordered the Rendeſvouz of his Army in the
foreſaid place, and that the Elector himſelf advanced towards
the <hi>Scheld,</hi> yet it is very likely that at the very beginning of
the Campaign, His Majeſty's real deſign was to Beſiege <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi>
for the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had Orders to Detach the
Earl of <hi>Athlone</hi> with 40 Squadrons of Horſe towards <hi>Lovain,</hi>
and in lieu thereof, the King reinforced the Elector with
ſome other Brigades; which being done, the King's Army
marched from <hi>Arſeel</hi> to <hi>Becelar.</hi> On the 3d of <hi>June,</hi> in the
Evening, His Majeſty went to view the Enemies Lines, where
he found the main Body of their Army incamped within them,
ſtanding to their Arms, as expecting to be Attacked: But
though there was no probability of Succeſs, in forcing of their
Lines, yet it was convenient for the Confederates, to further
their Deſigns, to get the <hi>French</hi> to bring all their Forces for
the defence of them, and therefore the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
likewiſe decamped on the 4th of <hi>June</hi> from <hi>Ninove,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
on the 6th between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Soheld,</hi> near the

Boufflers:</hi> So that things being in this diſpoſition, and that the
King could have eaſily bombarded <hi>Ipres,</hi> yet he thought it
better if poſſible, to take in the Fort of <hi>Kenock,</hi> and to that
end, the Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg</hi> was ſent with a Detachment to
Attack it: This though it was done with very great Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Vigour, and with the loſs of a pretty many Men,
and that he had poſſeſſed himſelf, after a long reſiſtance, of
the Redoubt <hi>Pintele,</hi> and lodged himſelf in the Intrenchment
of a little Bridge upon the <hi>Canal,</hi> over againſt the Fort; yet
finding at length it was impoſſible to hinder the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Fort, with the Body under <hi>Montal,</hi> who lay ſo
poſted, that he could ſupply it with Men and Proviſions as he
pleaſed, it was judged unadviſable to loſe any further time,
which might be improved to better advantages. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the King and his Generals, finding that <hi>Villeroy</hi> would
not ſtir out of his faſtneſſes, fully concluded upon the ſiege
of <hi>Namur,</hi> and in order thereunto, the Army marched on the
19th to <hi>Roſalaer,</hi> where the King left them under the Prince
<hi>de Vaudemont;</hi> and on that Day early in the Morning went
towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> in order to this great Work. There
had been all this time vaſt preparations making at <hi>Maeſtricht</hi>
of Artillery, Mortars, Bombs, and all manner of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and all the Boats of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> were detained at <hi>Liege,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:62930:259"/>
Maeſtricht</hi> and <hi>Huy,</hi> for the ſervice of the States. And tho' all
this threatned <hi>Namur,</hi> yet the <hi>French</hi> had brought all their
Forces within their Lines, without keeping any Body to guard
the Paſſages of the <hi>Sambre:</hi> But however this came about,
the King, who as we have ſaid, was moving towards the
<hi>Meuſe,</hi> ſent in the mean time Orders to my Lord of <hi>Athlone,</hi>
encamped at <hi>Tilmont,</hi> and to the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> Forces
now come as far as <hi>Faliſe</hi> upno the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> to inveſt <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi>
My Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> accordingly marched on the 17th
Old Stile, with the body of Horſe under his command, and
incamped between <hi>Malevre</hi> and <hi>Perwys,</hi> on the 18th between
<hi>la Faliſe</hi> and <hi>Templonee,</hi> where being joyned by the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
Troops, he left a good Body of Horſe next day at <hi>la Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſe,</hi>
and with the reſt of the Troops marched towards <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy.</hi>
This motion put the <hi>French</hi> in ſuſpence whether the
Confederates deſigned to Attack <hi>Namur</hi> or <hi>Charleroy,</hi> and
made the Marqueſs of <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who had paſſed the <hi>Meuſe</hi>

Body of Dragoons: But my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> having paſſed

the <hi>Sambre</hi> towards <hi>Namur,</hi> and preſſed all the Boats upon

St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> near the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> ſo that they had the liberty to
bring down their Batteries at firſt to the deſcent of that Hill,
and to open their Trenches at the foot of it near the <hi>Meuſe,</hi>
ſo that it did not then hold out above 5 or 6 Days. But now
to add a very conſiderable ſtrength to this weak part of the
Town, the <hi>French</hi> had made a detacht Eaſtion upon the aſcent
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:62930:260"/>
of the Hill, before St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Gate, all of Stone Work, with
a Caſemotte upon it, Bomb proof; the Counter-ſcarp of the
<hi>French</hi> Faſſe of Free Stone, and the covered way the ſame,
which pointed juſt upon the top of the Hill; So that no Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
from the Plain could bear upon this Work upon the Hill,
but the Confederates were neceſſitated to batter it in reverſe
from the other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> from the <hi>Brandenburg</hi>-Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
which required ſome Time before they co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld bring
them to the Water-ſide. But this was not all; for upon the
Right, towards the <hi>Port de Fer,</hi> they had made 2 or 3 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſtions of the ſame Work, juſt upon the Brow of
the Hill, and at the Foot of the ſame, before the <hi>Port de Fer;</hi>
and between the Hill and the Brook of <hi>Werderin</hi> they had a
4th, which hinder'd the Avenues between the Hills, to this
Gate. The Plain upon theſe Hills was fortified with a double
Covered Way, Palliſadoed, to defend theſe detached Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards the Village of <hi>Bouge:</hi> And when the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
were Attacking the place, they were working at a 3d
nearer to the brow of the Hill, juſt before theſe Works, ſo
that the Town which before was but weak, was now by theſe
additional Works exceeding ſtrong, and held out longer than
the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>French</hi> attack'd the Caſtle and <hi>Cohorn</hi>-Fort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of the Hill between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi>
and this they took care to fortifie afterwards, ſo as to leave
it almoſt unattackable the ſame way they took it before. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi>
or <hi>William's Fort</hi> fell into their Hands by driving their
Trenches round the Work along the bottom, between it and
the <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> or Upper Caſtle; which Work being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and all manner of Communication cut off, was
forced to Surrender: But the <hi>French,</hi> to prevent ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of proceeding another time, built a ſtrong Stone Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt
juſt upon the top of the Hill, between the <hi>Cohorn</hi> and
<hi>Terra Nova,</hi> with a Caſe-mott upon it Bomb-proof; and this
Work commands all this Bottom unto the <hi>Sambre,</hi> before which
Work they had alſo made a very good Covered Way, palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoed
from the Angle of the Gorge of the <hi>Cohorn</hi> to the
Brink of the Hill upon the <hi>Meuſe:</hi> Add to this a very good
Half-moon they had made upon the Curtain of the Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
of the <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> beſides their fortifying of the <hi>Devil's
Houſe,</hi> which flanks the ſides of the <hi>Cohorn</hi> towards the <hi>Meuſe</hi>
with a ſtrong Stone Redoubt; which place, when the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
had it, had but a ſimple Retrenchment about it, and
yet it held out 4 or 5 Days. From the upper part of the
Cohorn, which is towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> they had made a very
good Covered Way that goes about before the forementioned
Redoubt, to the Edge of the Hill upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> they had
undertaken a prodigious Line cut into a Rock, all along the
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:62930:260"/>
top of the Hill, near an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile in length, terminating
upon the Edge of the Hill towards the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and the ſame
Hill towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> with two Redoubts at each end.
The Line was finiſhed, and the Redoubt towards the <hi>Meuſe</hi>
very forward; but that toward the <hi>Sambre</hi> was but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
which they made up with Faſcines upon the Arrival of
the Confederates before the Place. And, in ſhort, the Caſtle
was ſo ſtrongly fortify'd upon the top of the Hill with all
theſe Outworks, that it would have been a very tedious piece
of Work for the Confederates to have attack'd it this way;
But the weak ſide of the Caſtle and <hi>Cohorn</hi> was towards the
<hi>Sambre</hi> and the Town, and the <hi>French</hi> had not provided for
an Attack on that ſide; ſo that all thoſe prodigious Works
fell into the Confederates Hands in leſs time than the <hi>French</hi>
had taken this Place before, tho' then far inferiour to what
it is now in Strength and Fortifications: To which if you add
the Strength of the Garriſon, being computed at near 14000
Men, and moſt of them the beſt Troops of <hi>France,</hi> headed
by a Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> and aſſiſted by Major General <hi>de
Megrigny,</hi> one of the ableſt Engineers in <hi>Europe,</hi> it would look
little leſs than a Wonder that the Confederates ſhould carry
it.</p>
            <p>But now its time to come to ſome Particulars. After the Place had been inveſted, the King ordered the Earl of <hi>Athlone,</hi>
with moſt of the Cavalry, to the Plains of <hi>Flerus,</hi> and ſo to
the <hi>Pieton,</hi> to conſume the Forage that was there; and a good
Reinforcement from the Army under Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> to
march towards <hi>Namur,</hi> where, on the 27th of <hi>June,</hi> the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
began to work on the Lines of Circumvallation, trace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ruines of that which the <hi>French</hi> had made when they
beſieged the place; but for want of their Cannon coming up,
they did not open their Trenches till the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> which
was done without conſiderable Diſturbance from the <hi>French:</hi>
But by the 3d their Cannon began to play from a Battery of
3 Pieces of Cannon from the <hi>de Bouge</hi> againſt the Old Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and from the Edge of the Height of <hi>St. Barbe:</hi> On the
4th a Detachment was ſent to reinforce the Prince <hi>de Vaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
upon an Information, that the Duke <hi>de Villeroy</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to attack him; who, to that end, had made his Army
as ſtrong as poſſible, and paſſing the <hi>Lys,</hi> advanced to <hi>St. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
of whoſe Motion the Prince being aware, he made a
Movement of his Camp at <hi>Woutergaem,</hi> to bring his Right
more to the Reer, to take up the riſing Ground of <hi>Arſeel,</hi>
which he judged more defenſible, and then ordered Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be made upon the Left towards the <hi>Lys</hi> and <hi>Walken,</hi>
as they alſo fortified all the riſing Grounds upon the right of
<hi>Arſeel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="515" facs="tcp:62930:261"/>
The Prince had then with him about 50 Battalions of Foot,
and 51 Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons; and with theſe
Forces he was then reſolved to expect the Mareſchal <hi>de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy;</hi>
though the latter had near double the number, with
which he was marching upon the 4th of <hi>July</hi> towards him,
and came up early enough to have attacked him: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was that he found the Prince's Camp ſo ſtrongly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed,
or that he would not then hazard a Battle, or that he
had Orders to ſtay till <hi>Montal</hi> had taken his Poſt in the Reer
of the Prince's Right Wing, between <hi>Arſeel</hi> and <hi>Wirk,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
him there, he remained in ſight of them that Evening,
expecting to have fallen upon the Prince very early in the
Morning, and in a manner to have caught him in a Net, by
invironing him on the Right.<note place="margin">P. <hi>Vaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Retreat.</note> But the Prince being informed
of <hi>Montal</hi>'s Motion, and finding he had already paſſed the
<hi>Thielt,</hi> wiſely changed his Reſolution of Fighting, and though
the time was very urgent and preſſing, he immediately with
a moſt admirable Judgment, reſolved upon and contrived a
Retreat, and as he is a Perſon of very great foreſight, he had
wiſely provided for ſuch an Accident in the Morning, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
all the Baggage to load immediately, and to March
by the way of <hi>Deinſe</hi> to <hi>Ghent,</hi> that it might not embarraſs
the motion of the Army. Firſt, the Prince ordered the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
to be drawn off of the Batteries, and to March towards
<hi>Deinſe,</hi> which was done with that Secrecy, that the Enemy
did not perceive it; for he had cunningly ordered the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be moving from the Batteries all the Afternoon; ſo
that when it went clear off, the Enemy thought it had been
but the ordinary Motion: Then marched the two Lines of
Foot upon the Left, along the Retrenchment; to cover which,
the Prince ordered a Body of Horſe to go and poſt themſelves
in the Retrenchment, as it was quitted by the Foot; the Foot
at the ſame time marching out with their Pikes and Colours
trailing, to conceal their going off. Neither did the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
perceive this Motion, till the Cavalry mounted again,
and abandoned the Retrenchment: By which time the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
was got into the Bottom, between <hi>Arſeel</hi> and <hi>Wouter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghem,</hi>
marching towards <hi>Deynſe.</hi> But while the Foot were
filing off from the Retrenchment, the Prince ordered Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Overkirke,</hi> with the Right Wing of the Horſe, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined
with <hi>Collier</hi>'s Brigade of Foot, to make a Line falling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Caneghem;</hi> extending himſelf from the Wind-mill of
<hi>Arſeel,</hi> towards <hi>Wink.</hi> And this Motion was in order to
make <hi>Montal</hi> believe that this Line was deſigned to oppoſe
his Attempt upon the Rear of the Prince's Right; but his
ſecret Orders were, to march off by <hi>Wink,</hi> to <hi>Nivelle,</hi> and
ſo to <hi>Ghent.</hi> At the ſame time that the Foot marched by
<hi>Wouterghem</hi> and <hi>Deynſe,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Rochford,</hi> who was poſted
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:62930:261"/>
with the Left Wing of Horſe and two Battalions towards the
<hi>Lys,</hi> made the Rear-Guard towards the Left, with a Line of
Foot upon the one ſide, and 3 Squadrons of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pinger</hi>'s Horſe
upon the other. All this was ſo contrived by the Prince, from
the Right to the Left, that the Army diſappeared all at once,
juſt as if it had vaniſhed out of the Enemy's ſight. The
Prince and the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> with other Generals,
kept to the Retrenchments till all were marched off; form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with their own Domeſticks and Attendants, a little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Horſe, ſtill to impoſe upon the <hi>French,</hi> and followed
the Army as ſoon as it was all got off. The Enemy finding
themſelves thus ſo ſtrangely amuſed, did what they could
to overtake the Confederates, and fall upon their Rear:
And particularly, <hi>Montal</hi> endeavoured to attack that Body
which was commanded by my Lord <hi>Overkirke,</hi> whom he
overtook with ſome Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons; but
the Defiles were good, and Brigadeer <hi>Collier</hi> had ordered all
the Grenadiers of his Brigade to the Rear of all, to face the
Enemy from time to time, as they advanced, in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files;
which was ſo well contrived, that the Grenadiers,
with their Fire, kept the <hi>French</hi> at a Diſtance, and made
good the Retreat. They attempted the ſame thing upon the
Rear of the Body of Foot, commanded by the Count <hi>de Noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles,</hi>
with the like ill Succeſs. However, two Squadrons of
their Dragoons, putting green Bows in their Hats, which
was the Confederates Signal of Battle, and ſpeaking ſome
French, ſome Engliſh, as if they had been ſome of their own
Rear-Guard, did by that means, towards Evening, come
up cloſe to their Rear, and marched along with them a little
way, till they came to a convenient place, when they fired
upon them firſt, and then fell in with their Swords, which
put the firſt Battalion into ſome Diſorder; But the other
facing about, immediately conſtrained them to retire after
they had killed a few Men, which was inconſiderable in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of this great and renowned Retreat, which was as
fine a piece of Art of War as can be read in Hiſtory, and
can hardly be parallell'd in it; and which ſhewed more the
Art, Conduct and Prudence of a General, than if the Prince
had gained a conſiderable Victory. And this was the Senſe
His Majeſty was pleaſed to expreſs of it, in a Letter he writ
to Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> on this Occaſion; which is the ſame
that follows:</p>

            <p>The Prince having made his Retreat in this Order, and the Army being poſted at <hi>Deynſe,</hi> (where a Garriſon was left, under Brigadeer <hi>O Farrell;</hi> as <hi>Dixmude</hi> was, with a good
Number of Men, committed to the Care of Major-General
<hi>Ellenburg,</hi>) and got as far as <hi>Nivelle,</hi> in his Way to <hi>Ghent,</hi>
there were Orders given to halt, and reſt there that Night;
But the Prince, as he himſelf afterwards ſaid, remembring a
Maxim of that great General, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> his Father, <hi>That when an Army is upon the Retreat, it
muſt be ſure to retreat out of the Enemy's Reach,</hi> they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to decamp again; and the whole Army, by 2 next
Morning, were got to <hi>Marykirk,</hi> under the Walls of <hi>Ghent;</hi>
from whence the Prince ſent a Reinforcement for the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Newport:</hi> And here, at preſent we leave him, as we do

which we ſhall now proſecute in as conciſe a manner as we

            <p>The Beſiegers,<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Namur</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the Surrender of the Town.</note> as it has been ſaid, having already inveſted the Place, and begun to raiſe their Lines of Circum vallation, this Work, becauſe of the great Circuit of Ground it took
up, kept the Soldiers and Pioneers employed from the 3d of
<hi>July,</hi> to the 10th; ſo that on the 11th at Night the Trenches
were opened againſt the Town in two Attacks, the one along
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and the other upon the adjacent Riſing Grounds;
the Enemy at the ſame time making a Sally, but they were
repulſed with Loſs. Next Night the Trenches were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on conſiderably, with no Loſs; and ſo on to the 15th,
when their Batteries were raiſed: And next Day the Trenches
next the <hi>Meuſe</hi> were advanced from one ſide to the other,
and the Day following they advanced 300 Paces farther; at
what time the Beſieged fired very furiouſly, and made a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and, after ſome Reſiſtance, retired: But upon the 18th
they made another Sally, about 3 in the Afternoon, with
1200 Horſe, and 4 Squadrons of Dragoons; and croſſing the
<hi>Meuſe,</hi> they fell upon the Trenches on the Right Hand of the
Bridge belonging to that River, took a Re-doubt that was
unfiniſhed, and only ſtuffed with Sacks of Wool, and fell with
great Fury, both in Front and Flank, upon the Beſiegers,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:62930:262"/>
who were forced at firſt to give way; But reſuming freſh
Courage, they were beaten back, with the Loſs of 300 of their
Men: Yet the Combat was alſo bloody to the Beſiegers. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the King finding that very Day that the Trenches
were advanced within Fuzil-ſhot of the Counterſcarp, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the ſame to be ſtormed that Evening, an Hour before
Sun-ſet; which was done by 5 Battalions of the Foot-Guards,
commanded by Major-General <hi>Ramſey;</hi> ſeconded by 9 Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
more of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch;</hi> and on the Left, by 8
<hi>Dutch</hi> and other Regiments, under the Command of Major-General
<hi>Saliſh.</hi> The Attack was made with extraordinary
Bravery, and ſuch Succeſs, that the <hi>French,</hi> after a Diſpute
of near 2 Hours, were beaten out of their Works. The King,
according to his uſual manner, remained upon the Place du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole Action, and had divers Perſons ſlain about
him; and particularly, Mr. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> Deputy-Governor of
the <hi>Bank of England,</hi> who was come into the Camp to wait
upon His Majeſty about Mony for the Payment of the Army.
The Confederates Loſs was not very great, conſidering the
Reſiſtance the <hi>French</hi> made; but it was too much, the Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and Wounded amounting to near 800 Men. But this did
not in the leaſt daunt their Courage; ſo that their Trenches
were on 19th advanced to the Village of <hi>Bouge,</hi> towards St.
<hi>Nicholas</hi> Gate: The ſame thing being done alſo on that ſide
next the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> as well above as below, with a Deſign to
draw two Parallels along the River on that ſide next the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs
of <hi>Jambe,</hi> and oppoſite to the Caſtle-Bridge; which
made the <hi>French,</hi> who were apprehenſive of the Deſign, to
ſet fire to the Suburbs, which retarded the Approaches that
General <hi>Cohorne</hi> had begun. On the 21ſt a Battery was
finiſhed on that ſide next St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Gate, and the Trenches
advanced 100 Paces towards the Rivulet that runs into the
Bottom, which the <hi>French</hi> had ſwelled with Water, and which
was ſecured with a kind of an Half-Moon. Next Day they
began to play upon a Baſtion, and the Works before St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>
Gate, from a Battery of 18 Pieces of Cannon: And on
the 23d the <hi>Brandenburghers</hi> played upon the Water-ſtop, in
order to let the Water out of the Moat, yet with little Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
becauſe it was lined with large Free-ſtone: But about
this time the great Rains which fell, incommoded the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
very much; However, on the 25th they continued
pealing from their Batteries below the Village of <hi>Bouge,</hi> and
on the other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> at the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Attack,
and levelled the Works which they had attacked the 18th
with their Cannon, and took in an Out-Baſtian, where there
was a kind of a Counterſcarp, that ſame Night, conſtraining
the <hi>French</hi> that defended it to ſurrender at Diſcretion. So
that the Siege went on briskly; and the Beſiegers, by the
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:62930:263"/>
27th in the Morning, being lodged at the Foot of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt
of <hi>Ballart,</hi> made themſelves Maſters of it; and about
50 French that defended it, were made Priſoners: But this
was not all, for, after much Reſiſtance, they carried and
lodged themſelves on the foremoſt cover'd Way of St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>
Gate that Evening. But in regard the <hi>Meuſe</hi> was low,
and for that, by reaſon of the great Number of their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
they had made great Breaches in St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Demi-baſtion of St. <hi>Roch,</hi> and at the end of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp
of the Town, they adventured to creep along the
River, and to ſtorm all thoſe Poſts, from whence they were
three times repulſed, but at laſt they did prevail; For, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Combat of 4 Hours, they not only lodged themſelves
upon the aforeſaid cover'd Way, but upon the Point of the
Counterſcarp, on that ſide next the River: Yet it unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
fell out, that ſome Sacks of Wooll, wherewith the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
ſecured themſelves, took fire; which made them, for
a time, lie open to the Firing of the Enemy; tho' they ſoon
made another Lodgment. While this was doing here, the
Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was not idle between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the
<hi>Meuſe,</hi> where, towards the Abby of <hi>Salſines,</hi> he not only
forced the Entrenchments next the <hi>Sambre,</hi> but made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Maſter of a Fort at the Head of thoſe Entrenchments;
where his Cuiraſſiers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Liegois</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cavalry
ſignalized themſelves very much, and vigorouſly repulſed 4
Squadrons that came out of the Caſtle, and had much ado to
prevent their being ſurrounded: But this was not all; for,
after the French had diſputed the Water-ſtop almoſt all Night,
the Beſiegers at length poſſeſſed themſelves of it. Then they
laid a Bridge over the <hi>Sambre,</hi> in the midſt of all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Firing, tho' all this was not effected without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Loſs on both ſides.</p>
            <p>But there was now no looking back; ſo that the 28th was employed in entrenching themſelves in the Poſts of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and Abby of <hi>Salſines.</hi> And the ſame day 60 Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and as many Muſquetteers were commanded out of
every Regiment, to make an Attack on that ſide, near the
Iron-Gate; which the French at firſt ſuſtained with great
Courage, but they were at laſt forced to retire: And the
ſame Evening the Line of Communication, near the Suburbs
of <hi>Jambe,</hi> was attacked; ſo that the French were no longer
in a Condition to make Sallies on that ſide. Next day was
taken up in attacking two Lines the French had drawn before
the Caſtle, between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> both which
the Beſiegers carried, one after another, with great Bravery;
whoſe Work on the 30th, early in the Morning, was, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
the great Entrenchment of the Old Wall, between the
<hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> that ſtill held out; which, after the
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:62930:263"/>
Beſieged had made a long Reſiſtance, by the Favour of a
Line of Communication of one Redoubt and two Trenches,
and being aſſailed both in Front and Flank, and that too with
an extraordinary Bravery, the French were driven as far as
the Counterſcarp of <hi>Cohorne</hi>-Fort; But the Beſiegers purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to the <hi>Devil's Houſe,</hi> where the French had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Cannon laden with Cartouches, and about 900 Men laid
flat upon their Bellies; and they being now come within the
Reach of thoſe Guns, the Enemy let fly at them in a moſt
diſmal manner, but the Aſſailants withſtood the Brunt with
incredible Reſolution; and after they had forced the French
to quit the Counterſcarp of the Fort, they made themſelves
Maſters of it; yet not being able to keep their Ground,
they retired in pretty good Order: But the French, in the
mean time, found themſelves neceſſitated to quit a Lined
Redoubt, ſome advanced Batteries, and their Entrenchment
from the <hi>Sambre</hi> to the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> There was alſo the very ſame
Day a Mine ſprung at St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Gate, which overturned a
good part of the Water-ſtop, into the Moat of the City;
and the Cannon played all the next Day, to widen the
Breach.</p>
            <p>Now it was become the month of <hi>Aug.</hi> on the firſt day whereof, the Beſiegers battered the Works, and the Breach that had been made at St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Gate, from whence they
threw a great many Bombs which did conſiderable Execution,
and next day towards Evening, ſtormed the Half-moon, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert-way
and Demi-baſtion, that lay on the right Hand of
the Gate, where the Breach had been made; and after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
repulſed no leſs than 3 times, they at laſt lodged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on the Counterſcarp, and carried on their Works as
far as Fort <hi>William</hi> and the <hi>Devil's Houſe;</hi> and next day all
things being in a Readineſs for a General Aſſault, Count
<hi>Guiſcard</hi> the Governour came himſelf, upon the Demi-baſtion,
where he ordered a White Flag to be put up in order to
Capitulate. Thereupon all the Batteries were immediately
ordered to be ſilent, and Colonel <hi>Mackarty,</hi> who waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Major General <hi>Ramſey,</hi> in the Trenches, was ſent to the
Breach to know what the Count deſired, who asked to ſpeak
with the Major General himſelf, and there-upon coming to
him, after mutual Civilities, the Count told him, <hi>That tho'
the Neceſſity and Condition of their Affairs, was not ſuch as to
oblige them to Capitulate, yet for the Preſervation of the Town,
they were willing to give it up upon honourable Terms.</hi> Upon
this, <hi>Ramſey</hi> acquainted the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen</hi> with it,
whoſe Quarters was juſt by, and promiſed the Count an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
in an Hours time, in which the King having Notice, he
ſent back <hi>Ramſey</hi> with Power to exchange Hoſtages, and an
Expreſs was ſent to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to give him No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:62930:264"/>
of it, and to Commiſſion a Perſon to treat about the
Surrendry; So that after ſome Conteſtation, the Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was ſigned the next Day, being the 4th of <hi>Aug.</hi> upon
honourable Terms. And here, for the preſent, we ſhall
leave <hi>Namur,</hi> and give the Confederates a breathing time for
the Siege of the Caſtle, and ſee how it fared with the French
elſe-where.</p>
            <p>But if the Confederates ſeemed thus to grow over the French by Land,<note place="margin">The Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Towns of <hi>France</hi> Bombarded by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</note> the latter were much more deſpicable by Sea, where they had no Fleet in the Channel, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
and Dutch at full Liberty to inſult them in their own
Ports, as they did divers ways. And firſt, they began with
St. <hi>Malo's,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Berkley</hi> with the Fleet, under his
Command, arrived on the 4th of <hi>July,</hi> gave the Signal next
day for the Frigats to ſtand in to the Channel with the Bomb
Galliots, and to attack the Town; Whereupon Captain
<hi>Bembow,</hi> going on Board the <hi>Charles</hi> Gally by 6 in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was ready to Sail, as Captain <hi>Durley</hi> at the ſame time,
Commander of the Fire-ſhip, called the <hi>Charles,</hi> and a Dutch
Fire-ſhip, had Orders to bear up with the Rock <hi>de la Couc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee</hi>
and attack it, and afterwards to ſet fire to the Veſſel, which
was vigorouſly put in Execution, and a little after the Fort
took Fire, but whether by the burning of the Fire-ſhips or
the fall of the Bombs is uncertain: However it were, the
Fire laſted for two Hours, but this was not enough; for our
Galliots and Frigats having got in about 7 in the Morning,
the former ſtood in ſo near, that in charging the Bombs,
they were forced to leſſen the weight of the Powder, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they would have gone beyond the Mark; So that about
10, the Fire took in ſeveral parts of the Eaſt-end of the
Town, and about 2 in the Afternoon, they could ſee a great
Fire, kindled in the middle of the Town, that continued
burning till Night, and could not be quenched without blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up ſeveral Houſes that were near. They threw no leſs
than 900 Bombs into the place, a great part of which was
reduced to Aſhes, and the Engliſh were perhaps the more
forward, in putting this deſign in Execution, becauſe we had
ſuffered more in our Traffick and Navigation by the Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
of this place, than from all the Ports of <hi>France</hi> beſides:
But though the Engliſh might, and really did Exaggerate in
ſome meaſure the French loſs, they on the other hand, made
it ſo diminitively little, as to appear in it ſelf very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
<hi>Granville</hi> another Town, not far from it, ran the ſame
fate, and ſome of the French themſelves have frankly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
this place to be reduced to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>But how different ſoever the Relations may be in reſpect to theſe places,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dixmude</hi> and <hi>Deinſe</hi> Surrendred to the French.</note> as they were afterwards, as to the Bombing of <hi>Calais,</hi> which hapned to be about the middle of <hi>Aug.</hi> and
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:62930:264"/>
the deſign upon <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the French Court did not like them,
as we ſhall ſee by and by, to whoſe Army under Mounſieur
<hi>Villeroy</hi> we are now returning, and ſee whether their Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
did in any degree counterballance the Loſſes they had
already ſuſtained, and whereof more was to follow. After
the Mareſchal had failed in his Deſign upon Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi>
as alſo againſt <hi>Newport,</hi> as we have before Noted, he choſe
rather to play at a ſmall Game, than to ſtand out; and
therefore he order'd <hi>Montal</hi> to lay Siege to <hi>Dixmude,</hi> which
though of it ſelf but a very weak Place, yet conſidering the
Goodneſs of the Garriſon, it might have made a better De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or at leaſt have got better Conditions, than to be
made Priſoners of War: But if there was any Treachery in
the matter, the Governour, Major General <hi>Ellenburg</hi> paid
dear for it, with the Loſs of no leſs than his Head, and the
Garriſon with hard Uſage, and a tedious Impriſonment by
the French, who would not releaſe them according to the
Cartell, till another Accident hapned that brought them to
a better Temper. <hi>Deinſe,</hi> alſo a Defenceleſs place, and its
Garriſon ran the ſame Fate; but though this came vaſtly
ſhort of <hi>Namur;</hi> yet the Damage done to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> as it was
of the ſame nature with our attacking the Maritime Towns
of <hi>France,</hi> ſo the ſame was very conſiderable: But Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Villeroy</hi> being come to <hi>Anderleck,</hi> would firſt, to ſhew
his Civility and his Maſter's Goodneſs, ſend a Letter to the
Governour, the Prince of <hi>Berghen,</hi> Dated <hi>Aug.</hi> 13th, to this
Purpoſe:</p>

The Contents of this Letter were looked upon very ſtrange,
and as it gave an evident Proof of the Damages done their
Sea-Port-Towns by our Fleet, and that the ſame did very
much affect them, ſo the Compaſſion pretended for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

which end, <hi>Villeroy</hi> being reinforced with all the Troops that
could be ſpared out of the Garriſons, and the Forces from

blew up above 1000 Granadoes charged, ruined a great
quantity of Arms, and killed and wounded ſeveral Perſons

according to the report of Deſerters; and notice being
come on the 14th, that all the Horſes in the Caſtle ſtood
ready Sadled, and that Monſieur <hi>Boufflers,</hi> had a deſign to
break through the Camp with his Cavalry, the King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ordered good Guards to be ſet at all places where the
<hi>Sambre</hi> could be paſt; the ſame being done all along the
<hi>Meuſe</hi> by General <hi>Fleming,</hi> which prevented the ſaid Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.
The Trenches were carried on the following days
with great Succeſs, though the Enemy fired furiouſly in the
Night-time, both with their great and ſmall Shot, and made
Sallies to diſturb the Work-men, but were ſtill repulſed.
And now it proved to be very hot Work on both ſides, and
the Beſiegers at length ordered their matters ſo well, that
they brought no leſs than 191 Pieces of Cannon and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
to play upon the Fort and Caſtle, but the Beſieged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
now to be more remiſs in their Firings. However, on
the 18th, they made a Sally with 200 Dragoons, mounted,
and 500 Granadeers, whereof an 150 of the latter made
their Attack on the right Hand, but were repulſed by the
Count <hi>de Ribera;</hi> then upon the left, where my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi>
had juſt poſted the advanced Guards to ſecure the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and a 100 Dragoons fell upon Lieutenant <hi>Sutton,</hi> who
being poſted in the Plain of <hi>Salſine,</hi> with 37 Fuzileers, let
them come on till they were very near him, and then giving
them a round Volley, retreated to his Body, but the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
preſſing upon him, they fired upon them a ſecond
time, when the Spaniſh and Bavarian Horſe falling on among
them with down-right Blows, drove them to the very Gate
of the Caſtle, killing ſome and making others Priſoners: But
the French Army being in the mean while come as far as
<hi>Flerus,</hi> to the Beſieged's ſuccour, that the latter might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they were in earneſt, they gave them a Signal of this
Approach, by a diſcharge of 90 Pieces of Cannon, which
was anſwered with a great number of Lights and Fugees
from the top of the Caſtle. This obliged the King to leave
the Care of the Siege to the Elector, and the Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein
Ploen,</hi> and to repair to the Army with a Reſolution to
oppoſe the French, who ſeemed now fully bent to fight him.
In order to this, the Marſhal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> drew out his Army
in formal Array, and attacked the advanced Guard of the
Confederate Horſe, for the gaining of an advantageous Poſt,
which obliged the King to keep the Field, from 4 in the
Morning, till 8 at Night, but the Marſhal being repulſed by
the <hi>Heſſian</hi> Horſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Villeroy</hi> fails to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi>
               </note> and finding it would not do that way, he
retired without any Noiſe in the Night, and next day was
ſeen moving along the <hi>Mehaign,</hi> extending his Right Wing
to <hi>Perwys,</hi> and his Left to <hi>Bonefſe,</hi> as the King at the ſame
time advanced with his Army towards <hi>Oſtin</hi> and that way, to
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:62930:266"/>
obſerve his motion. But tho' his Majeſty ſaw them now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from the Aſſaults of <hi>Villeroy</hi> from without, yet beſides
the troubleſomeneſs of ſuch a Neighbour, ſcarcity began to
creep into his Camp, wherefore upon the 19th of <hi>Aug.</hi> his
Majeſty with the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> and
other General Officers, concerted a General Aſſault for next
day; the diſpoſition and manner whereof was as followeth.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> with 3000 Engliſh, was to attack the Counterſcarp and Breach of the <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> and that part of the Line of Communication between the <hi>Cohorne</hi> and the
<hi>Terra Nova,</hi> which was next to the <hi>Terra Nova.</hi> The Count
<hi>de Rivera</hi> was to attack the Breach of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and that
part of the aforeſaid Line of Communication, next the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne,</hi>
with 3000 <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and Others. Major General <hi>la
Cave</hi> was to attack on the Right of Count <hi>Rivera,</hi> with 2000
<hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> the upper Point of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and part of
the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and part of the Communication to the <hi>Caſotte.</hi>
Major General <hi>Swerin</hi> was to attack the <hi>Caſotte</hi> with 2000
Dutch; and at the ſame time a Colonel was to attack the
Lower Town with 600 Men. The Signal was to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Quantity of Powder, blown up upon the old Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
near the <hi>Bruſſels</hi> Port; and the Word of Battle given by
the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> was, <hi>God with Vs.</hi> The Directions
given by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to the aforeſaid General Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
that were to command the reſpective Attacks in chief,
were as follows:</p>
            <p>That a certain number of Men ſhould be commanded in each Attack upon the <hi>Forlorn Hope,</hi> another number to ſuſtain them, and the reſt to be upon the Reſerve; and as to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
he left it to each General Officer, Commanding in
Chief, to do as his own Judgment, and the Occaſion, ſhould
direct him; only it was ordered that Count <hi>Rivera</hi>'s Attack,
and thoſe upon the Right of him, ſhould begin ſome Minutes
before the Engliſh Attack, becauſe that was like to be the
moſt difficult.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> the Night before the Attack, received a Detachment from the King, of 1000 choſen Men, which were to be part of his 3000: For his Majeſty was now at
the Head of the Confederate Army, and had left my Lord
<hi>Cutts</hi> to command all the Engliſh that ſtayed with the Duke
of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to carry on the Siege. It was ordered by the
Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Night before the Action, That all the
Troops deſigned for the ſeveral Attacks, ſhould march into
the Trenches before day, there to lie undiſcovered till the
Hour of Signal. The Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> in purſuance of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
marched into the Trenches with his Men ſome Hours
before day; but there not being room enough to cover all
his Men, he was forced to place 3 Regiments at the Abby
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:62930:266"/>
of <hi>Salſen,</hi> which was the neareſt Place to the Trenches where
they could lie undiſcover'd. The Diſpoſition which my Lord
<hi>Cutts</hi> made for the Engliſh, was as follows:</p>
            <p>He commanded 4 Serjeants, each with 15 Men (promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, in his Majeſty's Name, Advancement to the Serjeants, and Rewards to the private Men, if they did their Duty)
to go upon the <hi>Forlorn Hope:</hi> Theſe were to be followed by
the Granadiers of the Guards, under the Command of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Evans;</hi> and thoſe by the reſt of the Granadeers deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Attack of the Breach, making in all 700, under
the Command of a Colonel; 300 Granadeers were ordered
to Attack the Line of Communication. Colonel <hi>Courthop,</hi>
and Colonel <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Regiments, were ordered to ſuſtain
thoſe that attack'd the Breach: Colonel <hi>Hamilton</hi> and Colonel
<hi>Buchan</hi>'s Regiments were to make the Reſerve. And that
this might be the better performed, it was ordered that the
Regiments of <hi>Mackay, Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>Buchan,</hi> which were
placed at the Abby of <hi>Salſen,</hi> ſhould immediately after the
Signal given, march to the Place of Action, and draw up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Regiment of <hi>Courthop,</hi> there to receive further Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
About Noon, or ſoon after, the Attack was begun;
the Engliſh marching out of the Trenches, drew up under
the Enemies Fire; and notwithſtanding they had 900 Paces
march before they came to the Breach, expoſed all the way
to the Enemies great and ſmall Shot, which fired ſorely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Flank all the way, they went on with a great deal
of Firmneſs and Reſolution. Immediately after the Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers
followed Colonel <hi>Courthop</hi>'s Regiment, with Drums
beating and Colours flying.</p>
            <p>The beginning of this Attack looked very hopeful; but the 3 Regiments at <hi>Salſen</hi> not marching ſo ſoon as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, (either by a Failure of, or Miſtake in the Signal,)
the Engliſh Troops that were already engaged, were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
by the Numbers of the Enemy: And that which
contributed to their Misfortune, was, the Count <hi>de Rivera</hi>'s
being ſhot dead upon the Spot; the Count <hi>de Marſilly,</hi> (who
commanded the 600 Men that were to attack the Line of
Communication next <hi>Cohorne,</hi>) with his Lieutenant Colonel,
being both immediately ſhot dead; Colonel <hi>Courthop</hi> being
likewiſe ſhot-dead, and his Lieutenant Colonel, Sir <hi>Matthew
Bridges,</hi> deſperately wounded; moſt of the Officers of the
Granadiers being killed or wounded, particularly, Captain
<hi>Mitchel,</hi> of the Guards, ſhot dead; and Colonel <hi>Evans</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately
wounded; my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> receiving a Shot in his
Head, which diſabled him for ſome time; the Count <hi>de
Mercie,</hi> Colonel <hi>Windſor,</hi> Colonel <hi>Stanhop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> and
ſeveral other Gentlemen, who went Voluntiers with my
Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> in this Action, being wounded, and totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled.
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:62930:267"/>
And Count <hi>Rivera</hi>'s Attack not beginning quite ſo
ſoon as was intended, (by Reaſon of the aforeſaid Miſtake of
the Signal,) all the Fire of that part of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> which was
next the <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> fell upon the Engliſh, which had been
otherwiſe employed, if every thing had ſucceeded as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
After ſome time, the 3 Regiments from <hi>Salſen</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived;
but things were then in ſuch a Poſture, that they
were forced to begin a new Attack, inſtead of ſuſtaining
that already begun; for Count <hi>Nugent</hi> and Monſieur <hi>L' Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adie</hi>
were by this time come down, by Order of the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de Boufflers,</hi> (as we were afterwards informed by the
French Commanders,) into the Space which is between the
<hi>Cohorne</hi> and <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> with 1200 Foot and Dragoons of the
French King's Houſhold; and with theſe Troops they charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Forces in Flank and Rear, which were already in
the middle of 6 different Fires. The Battalions from <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi>
tho' they came too late to do us the Service intended,
did not want their Share of Suffering, as appeared by the
Liſt of their killed and wounded Officers and Soldiers. By
this time, my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> being dreſſed of his Wounds, and
come to himſelf, finding the Affair of the <hi>Terra Nova</hi> not
poſſible to be retriev'd, and obſerving the <hi>Bavarians</hi> upon
Count <hi>Rivera</hi>'s Attack, engaged in a very hot Fire, who
(notwithſtanding Count <hi>Rivera</hi> was kill'd, and the Prince of
<hi>Holſtein Norburg,</hi> Brigadier, wounded; and that moſt of the
Officers of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Guards were killed or wounded)
had fixed themſelves upon the outermoſt Retrenchment of
the Point of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> next to the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and maintain'd
the Poſt with a great deal of Obſtinacy, but could not gain
any more Ground; He ordered 200 Men to be detached out
of ſuch as were reſolved to carry the Point, or die by it, upon
Promiſe of diſtinguiſhing Rewards to ſuch as ſhould do any
extraordinary Action; and ordering thoſe to be ſuſtained
by the Regiment of <hi>Mackay,</hi> and that the other Engliſh For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhould rally and come after as ſoon as they could, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to bend his whole Force to make good the <hi>Bavarian</hi>
Attack: And as ſoon as he was come to the Place of Action,
he detached Lieutenant <hi>Cockle,</hi> of <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Regiment, with
a Party of choſen Men, with the following Orders:</p>
            <p>That he ſhould attack the Face of the <hi>ſaillant Angle,</hi> next to the Breach, Sword in Hand, without firing a Shot, that he ſhould paſs the Palliſadoes, and enter the cover'd Way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That if he could not maintain the Poſt, he ſhould make the
beſt Retreat he could with his Men, but that he ſhould
lodge himſelf, if he found any Place capable of it, with a
Promiſe in his Majeſty's Name, of a diſtinguiſhing Reward
if they ſucceeded, and out-liv'd it. At the ſame time he
commanded the Enſigns of <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Regiment to march
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:62930:267"/>
ſtraight to the Palliſadoes, and plant their Colours upon them,
with Promiſes of ſuitable Rewards. All this ſucceeded ſo
well, that Lieutenant <hi>Cockle</hi> entring the Palliſadoes, beat the
Enemy from the cover'd Way, and lodg'd himſelf in a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of theirs, having firſt turn'd their Cannon upon them,
for which his Majeſty has ſince Rewarded him with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
and Money. Whilſt Colonel <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Enſigns
were advancing to the Palliſadoes, the <hi>Bavarians</hi> renewed their
Attack with undaunted Vigour, (tho', as was ſaid before,
moſt of their Officers were killed and wounded) and ſo this
Poſt was made good.</p>
            <p>The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> expos'd himſelf to a Degree not to be imagin'd, going from place to place to obſerve what paſs'd, and give ſuch Orders as he thought fit, ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
being killed and wounded very near him; he gave away
Handfuls of Gold to the Engliſh Soldiers, as well as his own,
ſaying many kind things of the Bravery both of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Soldiers. No Gentleman ever fell more generally
lamented, than Colonel <hi>Courthop</hi> did on this Occaſion, giving
all poſſible Hopes of an extraordinary Man in the Military
Art, if he had lived. Colonel <hi>Windſor,</hi> Colonel <hi>Stanhop,</hi> the
Count <hi>de Mercy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tomſon,</hi> (eldeſt Son to my Lord <hi>Tomſon</hi>)
and other Gentlemen of Note before-mention'd, behaved
themſelves on this Occaſion with all the Bravery it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for Men to ſhew. And many other remarkable Actions
were done by ſeveral of the Engliſh and Scotch, too many to
ſet down here. Having gained the cover'd Way before the
Breach of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and the inferiour <hi>Angle ſaillant,</hi> or
Point towards the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and our Troops being fatigued by
ſo long an Aſſault, and the Enemies Reſiſtance, we content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our ſelves to make a Lodgment here, without any farther
Attempt upon the Breach. Upon this Re-inforcement of
Dutch and Bavarians, at this Attack, by my Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> and
the Engliſh Troops under his Command, the Enemies were
ſo employed in the Defence of this moſt dangerous Poſt,
as very much facilitated Major General <hi>la Cave</hi>'s Enterprize
upon the cover'd way before the <hi>Ravelin,</hi> and upper Point of
the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and ſo on towards the <hi>Caſotte,</hi> where he lodg'd
himſelf without any conſiderable Loſs.</p>
            <p>Major General <hi>Swerin</hi> commanding the Right Attack of all, before the <hi>Caſotte,</hi> and ſo towards the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uſe,</hi> (which reaches to
the Brow of the Hill, which has here a very ſteep Deſcent
to the River) over-came the Enemies Reſiſtance, and made
a very good Lodgment all along this cover'd Way and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
of about 300 Paces, which he extended to the
Left, turning in towards the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> about 140 Paces more,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:62930:268"/>
to join it to that of Major General <hi>la Cave,</hi> which reached
to the <hi>Ravelin</hi> of the <hi>Cohorne.</hi> The Dutch and Bavarians
(commanded at firſt by Major General <hi>Rivera</hi>) carry'd it to
the <hi>Angle ſaillant,</hi> or inferiour Point of the <hi>Cohorne</hi> towards
the <hi>Sambre;</hi> and our rally'd Forces continued it to the other
ſide of this Angle before the Breach, ſo that our Men were
now Maſters of one of the greateſt Lodgments that ever
has been made in one Aſſault, being near an Engliſh Mile
in length; Tho' they miſcarried in the great Deſign of this
General Storm, (which was to have taken the Caſtle, with
all its prodigious Out-works, by Aſſault) for want of a due
Correſpondence among our ſeveral Attacks, either by the
Failure or Miſtake of the Signals. Such a vaſt Lodgment
could not be done in a Moment, the Aſſault laſted till the
Evening, nor could it be gained without Loſs. I have not
ſeen the particular Liſt of the Foreigners, but the Chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
among them killed, were Count <hi>Rivera,</hi> Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and Envoy Extraordinary from the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to condole his Majeſty upon the Death of
our late moſt Gracious Queen; Monſieur <hi>de Marſilly,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
commanding the Regiment <hi>du Theil,</hi> and <hi>Fabrice,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Colonel; Colonel <hi>Lindroot,</hi> of the <hi>Brandenburghers;</hi>
and <hi>Heckeren,</hi> of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Their Chief Officers wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were, the Prince of <hi>Holſtein Norburg,</hi> Brigadier; the
Colonels <hi>Lindsburg, Caunits, Horne, d' Ohna</hi> and <hi>Denhoff;</hi>
and Monſieur <hi>de Millune,</hi> Colonel of a <hi>Swiſs</hi> Regiment; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a great many Lieutenant Colonels, Majors, Captains,
and Subaltern Officers.</p>
            <p>The General Computation in thoſe Times, was, that it coſt the Beſiegers between 1500 and 2000 Men; and about two Thirds of that Number to the Beſieged; tho' without
any Certainty. However it were, there was now no look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back for the former; and therefore the Cannon thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
continually againſt the Caſtle the two ſucceeding days;
and they continued to work hard to bring their Mine to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
under the Breach of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> when on the 22d,
about Noon, the Beſieged beat a Parly to bury their Dead
that had been ſlain in the laſt Aſſault: But now at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how hard they were preſſed, both from within, and
from without, and that there was no likelihood of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
they turned their Thoughs wholly to Capitulate;
to which end, the Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> came upon the Breach
a little before the Ceſſation was over, and called for the
Major General of the Trenches, and told him, That he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to ſpeak with the Elector of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> who, having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
Notice, went there-upon to the Breach; to whom
the Count offered to ſurrender the <hi>Cohorne</hi>-Fort: But his
Electoral Highneſs refuſing to Capitulate for any part, but
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:62930:268"/>
the whole; the Count replied, That the Mareſchal <hi>de Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers</hi>
commanded in the Caſtle, and that he would let him
know; and deſired, that in the mean while the Ceſſation
might be continued: The Reſult of this was, an Agreement
to ſurrender all upon honourable Terms, and the Exchange of
Hoſtages. Whereupon, an Expreſs was immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched,
to give the King an Account thereof, at <hi>Oſtin;</hi> but
his Majeſty, with the Prince <hi>de Vaudemont,</hi> was then coming
to the Siege, in his Coach, to order a ſecond Aſſault; when
he met the Expreſs by the Way. The Capitulation was
agreed on, and ſigned that very Night; and the Count <hi>de
Guiſcard</hi> obliged the Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> to ſign it,<note place="margin">The Fort and Caſtle of <hi>Namur</hi> ſurrendred.</note> becauſe
he had commanded in the Caſtle during the Siege; whereas
the Count had only commanded in the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> and the Out-works,
and ſo could not ſign for the Surrender of the other
part. And perhaps this was the firſt Capitulation that was
ever ſigned by a Mareſchal of <hi>France;</hi> and ſo much the
more to the Honour of the Confederate Arms, who took
this almoſt impregnable Place from a compleat Army with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it, headed by a Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> in the ſight of 100000
Men without, that came to relieve it, but could only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
Spectators of their Bravery: As it was to the Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the French themſelves, who had made ſuch additional
Fortifications to it, as they preſumed could never be forced;
and therefore they ſet up this Inſcription over one of its Gates,
<hi>Reddi, non vinci potest.</hi> But none can pretend to ſo much Glory
from this Conqueſt, as the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> under whoſe
Conduct and Direction all was happily atchieved; it being
unverſally acknowledged by all, as well Enemies as Friends,
That no Siege was ever carried on with greater Regularity.</p>
            <p>The ſame Evening that the Caſtle capitulated, Orders were given in his Majeſty's Camp, for all the Officers to lie in their Clothes, and the Soldiers to do the ſame, with
their Arms ready; and 60 Men out of each Battalion were
commanded to re-inforce the Paſs at <hi>Maſſy:</hi> All this being
done, to prevent all manner of Surprize from the Enemy,
who, upon the News of the Capitulation, might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
upon the Confederates Negligence, and fall upon
them; or they might have been prompted to it by their
own Deſpair: But they were ſo far from the one, or the
other, that the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> when he had notice of
the Capitulation, was ſo extremely concerned at it, that
for ſome Hours he would admit no Body to him; and at
length he marched away to the Plains of <hi>Flerus,</hi> with ſo much
Haſte and Precipitation, that he left many of his Foragers
and Out-guards behind him. But if the Mareſchal had
Reaſon thus to be ſorry, and to precipitate his Retreat, the
Confederrtes had no leſs cauſe of Rejoycing; and therefore,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:62930:269"/>
after they had taken Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Cohorne,</hi> they prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all things forthwith to diſcharge their Guns for Joy; for
diſperſing their Men in their ſeveral Poſts, from <hi>Maſſy</hi> to
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> along their Retrenchments: The Confuſion of
the Fire from ſo many different Places, was very agreeable;
and the Tripple Diſcharge of their Small-ſhot ſeemed to
be but one, of a long Continuance.</p>
            <p>And now it is time we ſhould come to the Evacuation of the Place, and to give an Account of the Garriſons of <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mude</hi>
and <hi>Deynſe,</hi> which were detained Priſoners in <hi>France,</hi>
contrary to the <hi>Cartel;</hi> and how the Confederates found
themſelves in a Condition to get Reparation for the ſame.
The 26th of <hi>Aug.</hi> being the day prefixed for the Garriſon to
march out, 4 Brigades of Foot were commanded to make a
Lane on both ſides the <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> up the Hill, and ſo down
again to the <hi>Mueſe,</hi> to the way that leads to <hi>Givet;</hi> a Bridge

to be preſent at the Marching out of the Garriſon; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
for the Troops encamped on the other ſide, if there
had been Occaſion. About 10 a Clock the March began:
The Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi>'s Guard <hi>du Corps</hi> went out firſt,
then his Domeſticks, and next himſelf, with the Count <hi>de
Guiſcard,</hi> the Governor, at the Head of the King's and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld</hi>'s
Dragoons, as many as were mounted, being between
70 and 80 in all. His Majeſty was on Horſe-back, with the
Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> before the Breach, and were ſaluted by
the Mareſchal and Count, with their Swords; when preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Monſieur <hi>Dickvelt,</hi> who had been acquainted with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal,

propoſed to his Majeſty of</hi> Great Britain <hi>to detain the whole Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
by way of Repriſal, the King had expreſſed ſo much Value
for his Perſon, that he looked upon him as a ſufficient Caution to
Anſwer for</hi> 6000 <hi>Men, the Number of the two Garriſons of</hi>
Dixmude <hi>and</hi> Deynſe. But at the ſame time he offered him
his Liberty, by his Majeſty's Order, if he would paſs his
Word for ſending back the ſaid Garriſons, or return himſelf,
a Priſoner, within a Fortnight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
anſwered, <hi>That he could not paſs his Word of Honour in a
Matter which he could not execute himſelf; but that it was in
vain to reſist.</hi> Whereupon, he put up his Sword, and went
back, with his Domeſticks, to <hi>Namur;</hi> where the Earl of
<hi>Portland</hi> gave him a Viſit, and told him, as from himſelf,
<hi>That he made no doubt of his Releaſement upon his Paroll of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as aforeſaid.</hi> To which the Mareſchal anſwered, <hi>That
in regard he knew not the Reaſons why his Maſter detained thoſe
Garriſons, he could not engage for any thing.</hi> From <hi>Namur,</hi>
he was conducted to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and treated in both Places
with all the Civility and Reſpect due to his Quality. But
his Confinement was of no long Duration; for, upon the
Return of his Gentleman of the Horſe, whom he had ſent to
give his Maſter an Account of what had happen'd, (who
thereupon gave the Confederates an Aſſurance of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of the fore-mentioned Garriſons,) he was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
releaſed; as our Men were in ſome convenient time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
With this, concludes the Campaign <hi>Flanders,</hi> which

            <p>Whether, by a Sympathy of Succeſs in the ſeveral Parts of their Dominions, the Spaniards, who all along had been on the loſing Side in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and more eſpecially the laſt

Advice that a Detachment of French were marching

de Melo,</hi> to join the 8000 that were beaten before. If the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> had gone on as they begun, they would have made
ſomething of it. 'Tis true, that after this Action, they
more cloſely blocked up <hi>Caſtle-Follet,</hi> with a Deſign to ſtarve
it, and not to take it by Force: But, alas! they could not
hinder the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> from putting Relief into it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, and to make their Forces retire from it, with ſome
Loſs. Neither had they any better Succeſs before <hi>Palamos,</hi>
tho' the Place was inveſted by Sea by the Fleet under the
Command of Admiral <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> as well as by Land by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Army, with the Additional Force of near 5000 Men
from on Board the Fleet. The French Accounts were, That
the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> marching to the Relief of it the firſt
time, found himſelf too weak; but being re-inforced with
more Troops for that purpoſe, the Spaniards no ſooner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
his Intentions, but they drew off their own Forces
and the Re-inforcement from on Board the Fleet returned
thither again. But the Truth of the Matter was, that the
Place muſt have been given up in a day or two at fartheſt,
had not the Fleet been conſtrained to bear away upon Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
received, That Monſieur <hi>Tourville,</hi> with the French
Fleet, was upon coming out of <hi>Thoulon,</hi> with a Deſign to

ſide, plyed the Beſieged with a Battery of 10 great Mortars;
and in a few days the Bombs and Carcaſſes had very much
endamaged both the Town, and the Out-works; which was
ſtill the more increaſed by the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Piedmontois</hi>
ſpringing of two Mines under the Claſſis of the Counterſcarp
of the Cittadel, with that good Succeſs, that they carried
the Palliſadoes and the Half-Moon by Storm; as they did
alſo the Counterſcarp. After this, there were Orders given
on the 9th, to draw a Parallel Line athwart the Claſſis of
the Cittadel; and the Work was ſo effectually carried on,
that the Line was finiſhed the next Morning, by Break of
Day, notwithſtanding the continual Fire of the Beſieged, to
hinder their Progreſs. Wherefore, finding the Beſiegers now
ready to ſtorm the cover'd Way, they thought fit to beat
a Parley, and to ſurrender the Place into the Hands of the
Confederates; who became the more eaſily Maſters of it,
becauſe of its Remoteneſs from the reſt of the French Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions;

ſwayed that Scepter for many years: And this he quickly

of the Donative, that had been frequently beſtowed upon
them, upon new Advancements, and then by going actually
into the Field to Head his Armies himſelf.</p>
            <p>This the Imperial Court was not long ignorant of, and therefore to obviate this Turkiſh Heat, of a young Prince, in the flower of his Years, and Heading a formidable Army,
they turned their Thoughts upon the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> as a

a Treaty with his Highneſs, whereby he was impowered to

Elector ſhould bring 8000 Men of his Troops into the Field,
to oppoſe this young Infidel, who about the beginning of <hi>July</hi>
arrived with his whole Power at <hi>Belgrade;</hi> where he had not
been long, but he began to think of Action. To attack the

with ſome Skirmiſhes: After which, the main Body of the Turks

            <p>There were various Reports, beſides what this Letter mentions concerning that brave Man, General <hi>Veteran</hi>'s Death; but the trueſt of all was, that when he found all was
loſt, and himſelf ſo deſperately wounded, 500 Horſe carried
him into a little Moraſs, and put him into a Calaſh, with a

ever ſince the loſs of the Place, to recover it again, ſailed
early in the Spring to Attack it, deſtroyed 3 out of 5 of the
Republick Ships, who fell in among them without the reſt
of the Fleets being able to double the Rocks of <hi>Spalmadori,</hi>

<hi>Zeno</hi> coming into the Road of <hi>Scio,</hi> ordered an Eſtimate

Preparations to re-take, and himſelf to be cenſured by all
that ever heard of the Action, as well as to be ſucceeded in
his Command by that noble Venetian <hi>Alexander Molino.</hi> But
how pleaſing ſoever this Repoſſeſſion of <hi>Scio</hi> was to the
Turks, the News they received from the <hi>Morea,</hi> was not
near ſo well-come, on which they had formed a conſiderable
Deſign. It's true, <hi>Ibrahim Seraſquier</hi> of <hi>Negropont</hi> entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

about 3000 Men ſlain upon the Spot, beſides Priſoners, and
to retire into their Retrenchments, which they quitted next

much haſte, that they left in their Camp behind, 14 Pieces

of Ammunition and Proviſion, 2 Standards, ſeveral Tents,
700 Head of Oxen, and 300 Cammels and Horſes, as a Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of the whole <hi>Morea,</hi> and the Beſieging of <hi>Napoli di Romania</hi>

the Infidels had concerted their Deſign. But I do not find
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:62930:273"/>
the <hi>Venetians</hi> made any Improvement of this Victory, tho'

it is to hold a precarious Crown; And as for the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi>

of it. And I am glad, That the Advantages which We have had
this Year, give Vs a Reaſonable Ground of hoping for farther Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
hereafter.</p>
               <p>Vpon this Occaſion, I cannot but take Notice of the Courage and Bravery the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops have ſhewn this laſt Summer; which, I may ſay, has anſwered their higheſt Character in any Age. And
it will not be denied, That without the Concurrence of the Valour
and Power of <hi>England,</hi> it were impoſſible to put a Stop to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and Greatneſs of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons,</hi>
I think it my great Misfortune, That from the Beginning of My
Reign, I have been forced to Ask ſo many, and ſuch large Aids of
My People: And yet, I am confident you will agree with Me in
Opinion, That there will be, at leaſt, as great Supplies requiſite
for Carrying on the War by Sea and Land this Year, as were Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the laſt Seſſion; and the rather, becauſe Our Enemies are
Augmenting their Troops; and the Neceſſity of Increaſing Our
Shipping does plainly appear.</p>
               <p>The Funds which have been given, have proved very defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>The Condition of the Civil Liſt is ſuch, that it will not be poſſible for Me to ſubſiſt, unleſs that Matter be taken into your Care.</p>
               <p>And Compaſſion obliges Me to mention the miſerable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, who ſuffer for their Religion.</p>
               <p>And therefore, Gentlemen, I moſt earneſtly recommend to you, to prouide a Supply ſuitable to theſe ſeveral Occaſions.</p>
               <p>I muſt likewiſe take notice of a great Difficulty We lie under at this time, by reaſon of the ill State of the Coin; the Redreſs of which, may perhaps prove a further Charge to the Nation: But
this is a Matter of ſo general Concern, and ſo great Importance,
that I have thought fit to leave it entirely to the Conſideration of
My Parliament.</p>
               <p>I did recommend to the laſt Parliament, the Forming ſome good Bill for the Encouragement and Increaſe of Seamen. I hope you will not let this Seſſion paſs, without doing ſomething in it:
And that you will conſider of ſuch Laws as may be proper for the
Advancement of Trade; and that you will have a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to that of the <hi>Eaſt-India's,</hi> leſt it ſhould be loſt to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And while the War makes it neceſſary to have an Army
abroad, I could wiſh ſome Way might be thought of to Raiſe the
neceſſary Recruits, without giving Occaſion of Complaint.</p>
               <p>My Deſire to meet My People in a New Parliament, has made the Opening of this Seſſion very late; which, I hope, you will have ſuch Regard to, as to make all poſſible Diſpatch of the great Buſineſs
before you: And alſo, that you will call to mind, that by the long
Continuance of the laſt Seſſion, We did not only loſe Advantages
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:62930:274"/>
which We might have had at the Beginning of the Campaign, but
gave the Enemy ſuch an Opportunity, as might have proved very
fatal to us. And I am the more concerned to preſs this, becauſe of
the great Preparations which the <hi>French</hi> make to be early in the
Field this Year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
I have had ſuch Experience of your good Affections; and I have
ſuch an entire Satisfaction in the Choice which My People have
made of you, <hi>Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons,</hi> that I
promiſe My Self an happy Concluſion of this Seſſion, unleſs you
ſuffer your ſelves to be miſ-led into Heats and Diviſions: Which
being the only Hope Our Enemies have now left, I make no Doubt
but you will entirely diſappoint them, by your Prudence, and Love
to your Country.</p>
            </q>
            <p>We will leave the Parliament to deliberate upon the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Affairs contained in this Speech, as we do Admiral Sir <hi>George Rook</hi> to go into the <hi>Streights</hi> in the room of Admiral
<hi>Ruſſel</hi> now come home with our great Ships; and obſerve,
according to our Cuſtom in the Concluſion of the Year, what
has fallen out that was particularly remarkable in the Courſe
of it, that could not well be introduced into the Body of the
Story, and we find only this, that <hi>Anſelm Francis Frederick de

nor ſo well then neither, ſave ſomething that happened in

were ſuſpected to be troubleſome, and which turned the
worſt of Miſchiefs to the beſt Effects, according to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Divine Providence, that had always appeared
very remarkable in the preſervation of that Sacred Life,
whom we ſhall never ſufficiently value. But to give a little
Sceach of what was preludious to the Diſcovery of that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Deſign againſt His Majeſty's Perſon, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that the <hi>French,</hi>

the loſing Hand laſt Campagne, not only made divers
new Levies this Winter; but divers Troops filed off daily
towards the Sea-Coaſt, which gave great Umbrage to the
Confederates, and eſpecially to <hi>Holland,</hi> as fearing they might
be deſigned to infeſt the Coaſts of <hi>Zealand</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> But
the Deſign was quickly unravel'd; for many Days in <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
had not been gone, but that it was a publick Diſcourſe
in <hi>France,</hi> That the Intent was to re-eſtabliſh the late King
upon the Throne; and that the Deſign was ſo far concerted,
that nothing more remained but the Winds and the Waves
to do their part: In order to this, the late King, on the 18th
of <hi>February,</hi> took Poſt for <hi>Calais;</hi> and, immediately upon his
Arrival, the Troops, Artillery, and Stores were ordered to
be put on Board with the utmoſt Diligence, while News
was impatiently expected from <hi>England</hi> to ſet Sail: And ſo
Cock-ſure were they in <hi>France</hi> of the Succeſs of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
that the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> in conſideration of his near
Alliance with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and with an aſſured Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Overthrow of moſt of the Confederates, ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that Prince in a very preſſing manner, to make his Peace
betimes. But if they were ſo mightily alarmed before on
the other ſide of the Water at theſe Preparations, they were
much more now, when they heard of the late King's Arrival
at <hi>Calais;</hi> which made the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> immediately
to diſpatch one of his <hi>Aids de Camp</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> to give his
Majeſty notice of all this. The Prince <hi>de Vaudemont,</hi> who
was then at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> with the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> both diſpatched
Expreſſes alſo to the King by way of <hi>Holland</hi> upon the ſame
account. But the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>'s Meſſenger going di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
by the way of <hi>Newport,</hi> with great Difficulty, in eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Enemy, got to Court firſt, which was on the 22d of
<hi>Feb.</hi> and acquainted his Majeſty, that the Duke had ſtopped
all the Ships in the Harbor and Canal of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> as well as
that of <hi>Bruges,</hi> in order to tranſport the Forces over for his
Service. And 'twas further ſaid, he ſhould ſend word, That
in caſe he did not hear quickly from his Majeſty, he would
run the hazard of bringing them over. The States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
made the like Preparations at <hi>Sas van Ghent.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:62930:275"/>
all the Expedition uſed by the Duke of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>'s
<hi>Aid de Camp,</hi> the King had received before ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Intimations not only of the Invaſion, but alſo of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
againſt his Perſon.</p>
            <p>But becauſe ſuch deſperate Deſigns as theſe are, cannot be thought to be concerted in a Day, it will be neceſſary to look a little back, and ſearch into the very beginning of it, as far
as could be diſcovered from ſuch Helliſh Darkneſs. It was
as early as the latter end of 1694. that the Embrio of the
Villany was contrived; and becauſe ſome might be brought
to engage in ſuch an Aſſaſſination, who otherwiſe ſcrupled it,
unleſs they had a Commiſſſion from the late King for that
purpoſe, it was agreed, that one Mr. <hi>Waugh</hi> ſhould go viſit
his Friends, the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and to give thoſe of
them he moſt confided in an Account, that their Friends in
<hi>France</hi> thought the killing of King <hi>William</hi> the moſt effectual
means to reſtore their old Maſter <hi>Jemmy;</hi> And, in order
to aſſure them of his Concurrence in the Fact, they ſhould
have a Commiſſion from him to command the doing it, and
an Order to all his general Officers then in <hi>England,</hi> to be
aiding and aſſiſting in it. To corroborate this Aſſurance
Major <hi>Crosby</hi> came at the ſame time over, and affirmed he
ſaw the Commiſſion Signed, and under Seal, in <hi>France;</hi> that
it was ſent away before him; and if it was not already come,
he was certain it was upon the Road. But however it came
about, and that the Project was to cut the King off before
he went to <hi>Holland,</hi> bleſſed be God, it took not effect: Yet
that it was really intended, is manifeſt from the Lady <hi>Mary
Fenwick</hi>'s Petition, praying a Reprieve for Sir <hi>John</hi> her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
delivered afterwards to the Houſe of Lords. But though
His Majeſty got ſafe, and eſcaped the intended Fatal Stroak,
the reſtleſs Spirits of thoſe wicked Men, ſome whereof were
born to be hanged, would not let them give over their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany;
and therefore they had ſeveral Meetings about it, and
one particularly, where were my Lord <hi>Aylsbury,</hi> my Lord
<hi>Montgomery,</hi> Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> Sir <hi>William Perkins,</hi> Sir <hi>John
Fenwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Goodman,</hi> who came in after Dinner. There they conſulted
of the beſt way to reſtore the late K. <hi>James;</hi> and all agreed
to ſend a Meſſenger over to the late King to deſire him to
procure of the <hi>French</hi> King 10000 Men, <hi>viz.</hi> 1000 Horſe,
1000 Dragoons, and 8000 Foot. Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to manage this Affair, who ſaid, he would not go on a
fooliſh Errand, and therefore would know what the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
would do, if Foreign Forces could be procured; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they all unanimouſly promiſed, if the late King would
come over with ſuch a number of Men as was deſired, they
would meet him at the head of 2000 Horſe, where-ever he
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:62930:275"/>
would appoint. At the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> 1695. or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>July,</hi> they had another meeting, when after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
publick Diſcourſes and private Whiſperings, Mr. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi>
deſiring the Company to acquaint him whether they
continued their former Reſolutions; they aſſured him, they
did, and would meet him with the number of Men, promiſed
at the former Meeting. Upon which, Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> told
them; he would begin the Journey in a few Days. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
being thus promoted, by diſpatching Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi>
into <hi>France;</hi> that the Aſſaſſination might not lag behind it,
ſome of the Aſſaſſins called to mind, that nothing would be
attempted in that kind, till the Commiſſion, which <hi>Crosby</hi>
ſaid was upon the Road, was come to their Hands. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Porter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> communicated the Project to
Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> who was then in <hi>England,</hi> and upon his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
for <hi>France;</hi> telling him, what Difficulties they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
under for want of it; and that a longer Delay of the
Commiſſion would extreamly embarraſs the Affair. Sir
<hi>George</hi> not only approved, but commended the Deſign; and
that ſuch an hopeful Project might not miſcarry, he promiſed
to uſe all his Intereſt, when he came to <hi>St. Germain's,</hi> that
ſuch a Commiſſion ſhould no longer be wanting. This En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
from ſo conſiderable a Favourite as Sir <hi>George
Barclay,</hi> (whoſe Bigottry to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſwaſion, and the
late King's Intereſt, would prompt them to any thing in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of him,) employed all their Heads, and opened all their
Purſes, to contribute the laſt Aſſiſtance for the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Aſſaſſination. The Beginning of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1695.
brings Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> again to <hi>London,</hi> with the unwelcome
News, That the <hi>French</hi> King was not in a Condition to ſpare
the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſuch a Number of Men as they deſired: Which
being imparted to the Chief of that Unruly and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty
Faction, the two Branches of the Conſpiracy to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the eſtabliſhed Government, were both laid aſide,
till the approaching Winter ſhould give them another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Nov.</hi> 1695, Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> with ſeveral Officers and Soldiers, and 800 <hi>l.</hi> in Mony, came into <hi>England,</hi> and and brought with him a Commiſſion from King <hi>James,</hi> (all
written with his own Hand,) to ſeize King <hi>William;</hi> which
Sir <hi>William Perkins</hi> confeſſed to a Committee of Parliament,
he ſaw: But neither Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> nor the Commiſſion,
being yet in the Hands of the Government, and the <hi>Jacobites</hi>
aſhamed to ſet up their late King, and themſelves, under the
infamous Title of Murtherers, they minced the Matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
more reliſhable Terms; and that it was only <hi>To levy War
upon the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>and all his Adherents.</hi> Others ſaid,
<hi>it was to attack the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>in his Winter-Quarters.</hi>
               <pb n="544" facs="tcp:62930:276"/>
All which are meer Tricks and Evaſions, invented by the
Party, to diſguiſe the Horrour of the Action; for the very
Gloſs which they themſelves put upon it, ſets it in its true
Light, for all the Party knew the meaning of <hi>Attacking of
the Prince of</hi> Orange, as appears by Monſieur <hi>de la Rue</hi>'s
Oath; who depoſeth, <hi>That when the Muſquettoon was lent by
Mr.</hi> Porter, <hi>to Mr.</hi> Pendergraſs, <hi>which would carry ſix or eight
Bullets, Mr.</hi> King <hi>deſired him, when he ſhot at His Majeſty, not
to be afraid of breaking the Glaſſes.</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> after
his Arrival at <hi>London,</hi> lodged in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and kept
himſelf very private, till he could ſpeak with Sir <hi>William
Perkins,</hi> Captain <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charnock;</hi> and that the
22 Men who were ſent by King <hi>James,</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> and
appointed to obey his Orders, were come to <hi>London</hi> alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And now they endeavoured to ſtrengthen their Party, by the
Addition of more Friends; as Mr. <hi>de la Rue,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> Major <hi>Lowick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knightley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bertram,
Chambers, Durant, Cramburne, Kendrick, Grimes, Waugh</hi> and
<hi>Goodman,</hi> ſome of which were engaged in the deſigned Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination
the Year before, and were now again confirmed in
it. As for Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> (who has now ſo honourably and
honeſtly attoned for his former Offences,) they were ſure of
him already: But to others, in whom they had no more than
ordinary Confidence, they diſcourſed of the Aſſaſſination at
a diſtance; and if they found in them any Reluctancy or
Indiſpoſition to the Aſſaſſination, they turned them over to
the Invaſion-Plot, and deſired them to be ready to meet their
old Maſter, at his Landing: But to thoſe whom Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
had made fit for any Impreſſion, they imparted their
Villany in Words at length; and ſo ſecured the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
either to be Rebels, or Murtherers. Thoſe that came
from <hi>France,</hi> knew not what Affair they were ſent upon, till
they arrived at <hi>London,</hi> but were kept in a blind Obedience
to Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Orders; as appears by the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Mr. <hi>George Horn;</hi> who ſaith, <q>That he, this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
was an Enſign of Foot under the late King <hi>James,</hi> in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and has ſince ſerved in the Second Troop of Guards,
in <hi>France:</hi> And about the 14th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1695, King <hi>James</hi>
ſent for this Deponent, and <hi>Michael Hore,</hi> his Comrade;
and in the Queen's Bed-Chamber told him, That he had
now an Opportunity of doing ſomething for him, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of his faithful Services: That he would ſend him into
<hi>England,</hi> where he ſhould be provided for; and that he
ſhould follow Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Orders; and in ſo doing,
he ſhould take care of him: That he had ordered them
Mony for their Journey, which they ſhould receive from
Mr. <hi>Caryll,</hi> the late Queen's Secretary. And he farther told
this Deponent, That he ſhould find Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> every
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:62930:276"/>
                  <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday,</hi> between Six and Seven at Night, in
<hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Square; whom they ſhould know by a white
Handkerchief hanging out of his Pocket. He alſo told this
Deponent, That when he came to <hi>England,</hi> he muſt go by
the Name of <hi>Jenkins;</hi> and his Comrade <hi>Hore,</hi> by the Name
of <hi>Guiney.</hi> And farther this Deponent ſaith, That Colonel
<hi>Parker</hi> was preſent, and heard all that the late King ſaid;
and went with this Informant, and his Comrade, to Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryll,</hi>
and told him, that the King had ordered each of them
Ten <hi>Lovis de' Ors,</hi> which would be ſufficient to carry them
into <hi>England:</hi> And if they ſhould be Wind-bound, he had
written to the Preſident <hi>Toffe,</hi> at <hi>Calais,</hi> to furniſh them
with what they ſhould have Occaſion for.</q> The reſt of the
Aſſaſſins were Men of deſperate Fortunes, Hangers-on at the
Court of <hi>St. Germains,</hi> or Soldiers taken out of ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments,
whoſe Character render'd them fit for ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
Enterprize.</p>
            <p>All the Aſſaſſins being come to <hi>London,</hi> that were expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>France,</hi> and their Number compleated, by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of others that were in <hi>England,</hi> the Execrable Deſign
was imparted to all the Deſperadoes; ſome of which were
ſtartled, and amazed with Horrour, at the firſt Relation of
it: But all the Scruples that Conſcience could raiſe, were
ſoon extinguiſhed by the Authority of the late King <hi>James</hi>'s
Commiſſion, and their plentiful Proſpects of Wealth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that would attend the Action: And therefore, All con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to forfeit their Honours, and hazard their Lives in it.
Now ſeveral Ways are propoſed by the Conſpirators, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their long-deſigned Attempt againſt His Majeſty's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
Some propoſed Seizing His Majeſty, and carrying him
alive into <hi>France;</hi> and to that purpoſe it was pretended, that a
Caſtle on the Sea-ſide was to be ſecured, to detain the King,
till a Ship was ready to tranſport him thither. But the Wiſer,
and more wicked among them, who underſtood what was
meant by Seizing the King's Perſon, laughed at this, as a
meer Chimera. Others propoſed to kill His Majeſty at <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington,</hi>
by attacking his Guards, and forcing his Palace, in
the dead time of the Night: But this, upon debating of it,
was alſo thought wholly impracticable. Some were for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
the King as he came on <hi>Saturday</hi> to St. <hi>James</hi>'s Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
And for this purpoſe, 40 Men, well armed, were to
aſſault His Majeſty's Guards, which commonly do not exceed
25; while 6 Men on foot ſhould ſhut <hi>Hyde-Park</hi> Gates, and
the reſt aſſaſſinate His Majeſty. It was agreed alſo to kill
the Coach-Horſes as they were entring into the Park, that
the Paſſage being ſtopped, the Guards might not be able to
come up till they had done their Work. Another Propoſal
was, to murther the King as he returned from Hunting, in
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:62930:277"/>
a narrow Lane, by a Wood-ſide, leading to the <hi>Thames,</hi> on
the other ſide of the Water, about 150 Paces long, wherein
there is a Gate, which when it is ſhut, hinders Coaches or
Horſes from paſſing that way. One of the Aſſaſſins was ſent
to view the Ground, and another to view the Lane before-mentioned:
But Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> who was to command
this infamous Party, did not approve of that Lane; and the
Difficulty that aroſe in the Debate, cauſed the Project to be
rejected. At laſt they fixed upon a Place betwixt <hi>Brentford</hi>
and <hi>Turnham-Green,</hi> in a Bottom, where the Ground is Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh:
There is a Bridge, where divers Roads meet, and cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs
oen another. On the North ſide there is a Road that goes
round <hi>Brentford;</hi> and on the South, a Lane that leads to the
River; ſo that one may come thither by four ſeveral Ways.
After you have paſſed the Bridge, the Road grows narrow;
having on one ſide a Foot-Path, and on the other a tall and
thick Hedge. And this Place was pitched upon for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of their barbarous Villany: And truly, if Heaven had
not diſcovered their Treaſons, (all Circumſtances conſidered,
a more unlucky Place and Time could not have been found
out; for His Majeſty very often returned late from Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and uſually croſſed the Water at <hi>Queen</hi>'s-Ferry, by <hi>Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
with no greater Attendance than 5 or 6 of his Guards:
It was alſo His Majeſty's Cuſtom to enter the Ferry-Boat
without coming out of his Coach; and as ſoon as he landed
on this ſide the Water, the Coach drove on, without expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reſt of the Guards, who could not croſs the <hi>Thames</hi>
till the Boat returned to <hi>Surrey</hi>-ſide, to bring them over; and
ſo the King muſt inevitably have fallen into the Hands of his
Murtherers, before the reſt of the Guards could have come
up to his Aſſiſtance. Neither was the Time and Place more
cunningly and Deviliſhly contrived, than their Men were
diſpoſed of; for having ſecured ſeveral Places at <hi>Brentford,
Turnham-Green,</hi> and in ſcattered Houſes thereabouts, to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

One of the Conſpirators was ordered to wait at <hi>Queen</hi>'s-Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
till the King's Guards appeared in ſight, on <hi>Surrey</hi>-ſide of
the Water, and then to give ſpeedy Notice to the reſt, to be
ready at their reſpective Poſts while the King was croſſing
the <hi>Thames.</hi> For this wicked End, they were divided into
three Parties, which was to make their Approaches by three

Deſign was accompliſhed, the Conſpirators reſolved
to keep in a Body till they came beyond <hi>Hammerſmith,</hi> and
then to ſeparate, and by ſeveral Roads to haſten to <hi>London,</hi>
and from thence to the Sea-ſide; where the ſudden Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>French</hi> might ſecure them from the Rage of the
Multitude, and the Hand of Juſtice. Thus was the Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to make way for a <hi>French</hi> Invaſion; and the Invaſion
to ſhelter the Murtherers of our King and Country. Horſes
were now the only Neceſſaries wanting; and Sir <hi>George Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi>
complaining that the 800 <hi>l.</hi> which he brought over was
already ſo far exhauſted, that he could not out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder

that he ſhould find but half; and the other 20 ſhould be
ſupplied by Sir <hi>William Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock.</hi>

            <p>All things being thus agreed on, the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> who was ſent into <hi>England</hi> to countenance the Action, poſted for <hi>France</hi> to give his ſuppoſed Father an account of it, who
ſhewed himſelf mightily pleaſed with it; and indeed, the
Villany was now in a manner brought to a Criſis. For, the
Fifteenth Day of <hi>February,</hi> was the Day appointed to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the King, if kind Heaven had not prevented it, and now
the Leaders having quartered the Aſſaſſines, in ſeveral parts
of the Town, to prevent ſuſpition, they all lay cloſe and ſtill,
expecting notice from their Orderly Men of the King's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gone to <hi>Richmond.</hi> But ſo it pleaſed God Almighty, that
His Majeſty, did not go Abroad that Day: This diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and fears of a Diſcovery, made <hi>Plouden, Kendrick,</hi> and
<hi>Sherborn</hi> decline the Action, and withdraw themſelves; but
Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> Sir <hi>William Perkins,</hi> Cap. <hi>Porter,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Goodman,</hi> concluding the Deſign was not Diſcovered, becauſe
they were not taken up by the Government; had another
Meeting, <hi>Feb.</hi> the 19th and there reſolved to Execute their
Bloody Project, on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d. of <hi>February.</hi> The Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
of that Day was ſpent in a tedious expectation of News,
that the King was gone Abroad, when one of their Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Men, (which they lodged at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> to give them No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
when the King went out) tells them that the Guards
were all come back in a Foam, and that there was a mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
among the People, that a Damnable Plot was Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and this unexpected News diſperſed all the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
and drove them to ſhift for themſelves, by a ſpeedy
Flight: Nor, were their apprehenſions of a Diſcovery ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
for the Plot and the Progreſs that was made in it, from
time to time, had been Diſcovered by <hi>Richard Fiſher,</hi> to the
Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> a conſiderable time
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:62930:278"/>
before any other Perſon Diſcovered it, and as things ripen'd
for Action, his Lordſhip was a cquainted with the Particulars.
On the 10th of <hi>February,</hi> he acquainted that Noble Lord,
how far it was advanced, and promiſed to wait upon his
Lordſhip with a further Account in a few Days, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he did: On <hi>February</hi> the 13th he gave his Lordſhip a full
Account of the Deſign it ſelf, and the Time, Place, and
Manner, of its Execution; but refuſing to give to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Names of the Conſpirators, made his Diſcovery ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
till the Addition of other Witneſſes gave an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable
Authority to the Truth of it. Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs</hi> who
was wholly ignorant of this Barbarous Deſign, till he was
ſent for to <hi>London,</hi> and there acquainted with it, being ſtruck
with Horror and Aſtoniſhment at the firſt Propoſal of it,
even then took a Reſolution to preſerve His Majeſty's Life,
and Diſcover the Conſpiracy: Accordingly on <hi>February</hi> 14th
he waited on the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> at his Lordſhip's Lodgings
at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and being admitted to Privacy with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

his Lordſhip with this ſurprizing Requeſt: <hi>Pray, My

a Relation of the whole Plot, as it had been Communicated
unto him by the Confederated Aſſaſſines, which he ſaid, he
would have told the King himſelf, but that he durſt not go
to <hi>Kenſington,</hi> for fear of the two Orderly Men, which were
kept as Spies there, to give Intelligence of what occurred in
that Court. He was introduced that Night to the King,
though very late; and there in his whole Deportment, ſhew'd
himſelf to be a Man of Honour; neither was Mr. <hi>de la Rue</hi>
ſhort of Mr. <hi>Pendergras,</hi> in making a diſcovery of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Aſſaſſination, though his Friend Brigadeer <hi>Lewſon,</hi>
who he deſigned ſhould acquaint the King with it, being
then out of Town, makes his Information appear ſomewhat
latter then the former; For as he is a Man of too much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be engaged in a Murder, ſo his concern to diſcover
it, was from the beginning, though he did not declare it,
till his Diſcovery might be ſerviceable to His Majeſty; and
then as ſoon as he had opportunity to impart the Secret, he
did it, and Brigadier <hi>Lewſon</hi> much about the ſame time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the King, that Mr. <hi>de la Rue</hi> informed him of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
carrying on to Aſſaſſinate His Majeſty, and had given
him a particular Account, by what methods it was deſign'd
to be accompliſhed, and propoſed a way, if the King thought
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, how all the Conſpirators might be taken in Arms, when
they thought to attempt it: But that which ſeems ſtrange in
all theſe Diſcoverers, though they punctually agreed, and in
the Circumſtances, yet they all peremptorily refuſed to name
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:62930:278"/>
the Conſpirators, which might have been of fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
if the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> had not found out the happy
expedient to prevent it, by perſwading His Majeſty to give
himſelf the trouble to examine Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>de
la Rue</hi> in his Cloſet: His Majeſty being overcome by the
Reaſons alledged, by that Noble Peer, condeſcended to his
Requeſt, and examined them both ſeperately. At Mr. <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergraſs</hi>'s
Examination, was preſent the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and
the Lord <hi>Cuts,</hi> and Mr. <hi>de la Rue</hi>'s Examination was heard
by the ſame Noble Earl, and Brigadier <hi>Lewſon:</hi> After the
Examination, His Majeſty ſhewed himſelf extreamly well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in the Truth of their Diſcoveries, and in a very oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner, expreſſed his Reſentments to, of their great
Care and Zeal they ſhewed for the preſervation of his Life,
and the ſafety of the Kingdom; and at laſt gave them ſuch
unanſwerable Reaſons, why as Men of Honour, and lovers
of their Country, they ſhould compleat their Duty and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in diſcovering the Names of the Conſpirators, that quite
ſubdued their former Obſtinacies, and prevailed upon them
to make a full and true Diſcovery of the Aſſaſſins, under the
promiſe of not being made uſe of as Evidences; But Mr. <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergraſs</hi>
hearing that Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> who engaged him in it, had
Diſcovered and Accuſed him, he thought himſelf Diſcharged
from any Obligation of Honour in concealing it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
afterwards as an Evidence for the King, freely told all
he knew at <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Tryal, <hi>Pag.</hi> 40. The King having now
a perfect knowledge of the Conſpiracy, and the Names of
the Conſpirators, His Majeſty Iſſues out his Royal Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
requiring all his Loving Subjects to Apprehend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,
promiſing 1000 <hi>l.</hi> reward for every Offender, that
ſhould be taken and brought to Juſtice. And here give me
leave to take notice of the extream Fury, Madneſs, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottry
of Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> who meeting with Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi> acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
at <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> Back-gate, told him, That Warrants,
were out againſt them (as he heard) and they had as good
if he would come to his Lodging, go up to <hi>Kenſington</hi> and do
the Work at once, and take off the Spark, and then they
ſhould be all at quiet, and have the King peaceably here.
What a ſtrange infatuation this ingenious Man was under, is
a wonder to all that knew him: Immediately after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
was out, Mr. <hi>George Harris,</hi> one of the Perſons that
was ſent out of <hi>France,</hi> to obey the Orders of Sir <hi>George Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi>
and was actually engaged in the Aſſaſſination, reſigned
himſelf to the Right Honourable Sir <hi>William Trumbal,</hi> one of
His Majeſty's principal Secretaries of State, and generouſly
convinced him of the reality of the Aſſaſſination, and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
Plots, though he was not able to declare the particular
Circumſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that attended them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="550" facs="tcp:62930:279"/>
His Majeſty being now fully convinced on all hands, both
of the Conſpiracy and intended Invaſion, uſed no delay in
ſending for a ſufficient number of Troops over, as he gave
all neceſſary Orders to Arm the Fleet; Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
immediately ordered down to <hi>Chatham</hi> for that purpoſe,
and the Rendeſvous appointed in the <hi>Downs,</hi> where all the
Men of War we had in the Sea-ports, were ordered to come
and join the Admiral, that with ſuch Diſpatch and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Celerity, and that in 4 or 5 days time, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
had a Fleet of near 60 Men of War in a Line of Battle,
paſſing by <hi>Dover-Caſtle,</hi> from whence he was ſaluted by the
Earl of <hi>Rumney</hi> with his Guns, and ſtanding over directly
for the Coaſt of <hi>Calais</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> more to the Terror and
Amazement of the Enemy, than the ſudden News of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was to us: And here again, I cannot but remark the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Providence of Almighty God; for our outward-bound
Merchant-ſhips, and their Convoys, together with the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
deſign'd for the <hi>Streights,</hi> had been a long time detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by contrary Winds, which was very afflicting to our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and all were ſorry Sir <hi>George Rook</hi> could not for this
Reaſon be ſo ſoon reinforced as was neceſſary, to enable him
to defend the Paſſage of the <hi>Streights,</hi> againſt the Naval Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
that were made at <hi>Thoulon.</hi> But at the ſame time,
that they appeared ſo much concerned at the Obſtinacy of
theſe Weſterly Winds that had now been fix'd for 2 Months;
God who ſees all things, and even the moſt ſecret Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Deſigns of Men, provided them for our ſafety, and
made that wholſome Phyſick for us, which we imagined to
be Poiſon. <hi>Thy Way, O God! is in the Sea, and thy Paths in
the great Waters, and thy foot-ſteps are not known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, while theſe things were doing upon the Sea, and that the Admiral was bearding of the French up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own Coaſt, who durſt not now as much as peep
out of their lurking Holes; The King thought fit to acquaint
the two Houſes of Parliament with the Conſpiracy, and what
he had done in order to obviate the ſame, and this he did in
the following Speech:</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
I Came hither this Day upon an extraordinary Occaſion,<note place="margin">The King's Speech to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which
might have proved fatal, if it had not been diſappointed by
the ſingular Mercy and Goodneſs of God; and may now, by the
Continuance of the ſame Providence, and Our own prudent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
be ſo improved, as to become a ſufficient Warning to
Vs to provide for our Security, againſt the pernicious Practiſes
and Attempts of Our Enemies. I have received ſeveral concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Informations of a Deſign to aſſaſſinate Me: And that Our
Enemies, at the ſame time, are very forward in their Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:62930:279"/>
for a ſudden Invaſion of this Kingdom, I have therefore
thought it neceſſary to loſe no Time in acquainting My Parliament
with theſe Things, in which the Safety of the Kingdom, and the
Publick Welfare, are ſo nearly concerned, that I aſſure My Self,
nothing will be omitted on your Part, which may be thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for Our preſent or future Security, I have not been wanting
to give the neceſſary Orders for the Fleet; and I hope We have
ſuch a Strength of Ships, and in ſuch a Readineſs, as will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to diſappoint the Inventions of Our Enemies. I have alſo
diſpatched Orders for bringing home ſuch a Number of Our Troops
as may ſecure us from any Attempt. Some of the Conſpirators
againſt My Perſon are already in Cuſtody; and Care is taken to
apprehend as many of the reſt as are diſcovered: And ſuch other
Orders are given, as the preſent Emergency of Affairs do abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
require at this time, for the Publick Safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
Having now acquainted You with the Danger which hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

againſt the like Villanous Attempts for the future: To
which end they did, on the 25th of <hi>February,</hi> enter into an
Aſſociation to defend his Perſon and revenge his Death:
And to that of the Commons, the King was pleaſed to give
this Anſwer, <hi>That he took it as a moſt convincing and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Evidence of their Affection; and as they had freely aſſociated
themſelves for their common Safety, he did himſelf heartily enter
into the ſame Aſſociation, and would be always ready with them,
and the reſt of his good Subjects, to venture his Life againſt
all thoſe who ſhould endeavour to ſubvert the Religion, Laws and
Liberties of</hi> England. But becauſe they thought this was not
ſufficient, they proceeded to make other Laws more bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the King's and Our Security. And Firſt, <hi>That ſuch
as ſhould refuſe to take the Oaths of Fidelity to His Majeſty,
ſhould be ſubject to the Forfeitures and Penalties of Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
Convict.</hi> Secondly, <hi>To inflict Penalties on all that by Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or otherwiſe declared, that King</hi> William <hi>was not lawful
and rightful King of</hi> England. Thirdly, <hi>To ratifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Aſſociation, to diſable any from being capable of any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Profit and Truſt, that ſhould not Sign the Aſſociation; and
that whenever it ſhould pleaſe God to afflict theſe Nations by the
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:62930:280"/>
Death of his preſent Majeſty, that the Parliament then in being
ſhould not be diſſolved thereby, but ſhould continue till the next Heir
to the Crown in Succeſſion ſhould diſſolve them.</hi> Which laſt was
undoubtedly as great a Stroak to our Enemies abroad, as
any thing that has fallen out ſince the Revolution: For it
cannot be thought the late King ſhould ever flatter himſelf
to that degree, of being reſtored by a Free Parliament. But
while we were thus ſecuring our ſelves within, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was not unmindful of raiſing the neceſſary Supplies to
carry on the War abroad; and therefore there were ſeveral
good Bills prepared for that purpoſe, and ſigned, at ſeveral
times, by his Majeſty, before the end of <hi>April.</hi> While, in
the mean time, divers of the Aſſaſſins were Tried: And
firſt, <hi>Robert Charnock, Edward King,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Keys,</hi>
came to their Tryals on the 11th of <hi>March;</hi> and, upon a full
Hearing and Evidence, were all found Guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and having received Sentence of Death accordingly,
they were, upon the 18th of the ſaid Month, executed at
<hi>Tyburn:</hi> But before they were turned off, each of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
a Paper to the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi>
wherein every one of them reſpectively confeſs'd himſelf
Guilty of the Crime he was accuſed of. But for the fuller
Satisfaction of the Reader, and in purſuance to the Deſign of
this Treatiſe, we'll give you their Papers delivered by them

                  <p>I Am now within a few Moments of Eternity, brought to this Place by the Juſt Hand of God in Puniſhment of all my Crimes; but particularly of that, of which I have been
lately Arraigned, and for which I ſtand here Condemn'd;
but I hope, that Goodneſs of God, which has given me a
Senſe of my Wickedneſs, will accept my Repentance, and
ſhew Mercy on me; which I hope to obtain thro' the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and Merits of my Redeemer, upon whom I intirely caſt
my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And that I may find his Mercy, I think my ſelf oblig'd to do Juſtice to my Neighbour, that ſo none may ſuffer wrongfully on my Account; and therefore as I am ſoon to
Anſwer the Truth of what I ſay before the Tribunal of
God.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Firſt</hi> declare, That I never ſaw any Order or Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of King <hi>James</hi>'s promoting the Aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

but was drawn into it by my own Raſhneſs and Paſſion,

                  <p>And I hope that ſuch who think the Misfortune of their Impriſonment or Trouble, is deriv'd from my having been engaged in this Enterprize; or ſuch to whom it has any ways

I freely and heartily forgive all Mankind. In this Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

                  <p>KNowing that I muſt immediately give an Account to God of all my Actions, and that I ought to be eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially careful of what I ſay in theſe laſt Hours, I do ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

The Cauſe I am brought hither to ſuffer for, I do firmly
believe to be the Cauſe of God and True Religion, and to
the beſt and utmoſt of my Knowledge and Information,
agreeable to the Laws of the Land, which I have evermore
heard to require a firm Duty and Allegiance to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign;
and that as no Foreign, ſo neither any Domeſtick
Power can alienate our Allegiance. For it is altogether new
and untelligible to me, that the King's Subjects can depoſe
and dethrone him on any account, or conſtitute any that
have not an immediate Right in his Place. We ought, I
think, not to do this; and ſurely when it is done, to aſſiſt
him in the Recovery of his Right, is juſtifiable, and our
Duty. And howſoever things may ſeem at preſent, I do <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
I am ſure I heartily <hi>pray,</hi> That he ſhall be one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to his rightful Throne and Dominions.</p>
                  <p>As for any ſudden Deſcent of his Majeſty upon theſe his Dominions, in order to the Recovery of them, I declare I had no certain knowledge of it, nor can I tell what Grounds
there was to believe it, ſo little Reaſon had I to be in a
preſent Preparation for it. I ſuppoſe it is not expected I
ſhould endeavour to clear my ſelf out of the Aſſaſſination,
which was not the thing alledg'd againſt me; however, it
was mentioned, through what means I know not: As it
was inſinuated to my diſadvantage, I forgive ſuch as were
therein inſtrumental: And I do alſo from the very bottom
of my Soul, freely forgive, and beg of God to do ſo too,
ſuce as were any ways acceſſary towards the taking away my
Life, which I really look upon to be their Misfortune more
than mine.</p>
                  <p>I profeſs my ſelf, and I thank God I am ſo, a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though, God knows, a moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and unprofitable part of it; of that Church which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
ſo much at preſent for a ſtrict adherence to Loyalty, the
Law, and Chriſtian Principles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For this I Suffer, and for this I Die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though I have a perfect Charity for People of all Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and do heartily wiſh well, and would endeavour ſo to do, to all my Fellow-Subjects, of what Perſuaſions ſoever.
And indeed, I have met with a great deal of Uprightneſs and
Sincerity among ſome People of very different Opinions in
Religious Matters.</p>
                  <p>And I hope and deſire it may not be taken as an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Cenſure, or undue Reflection, that I objected to the Legality of the Popiſh Evidence, being adviſed ſo to do for my
better Security, upon the Foundation of a Statute-Law.</p>

Having own'd my ſelf a Member of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I muſt take this Opportunity and I do it for God's
Glory, to apply my ſelf to you that are Royaliſts of that
Church, of the ſame Faith and Principles with my ſelf; and
I beg of you for God's ſake, and the Love of your Souls,
to be very conſtant and ſerious in all Religious Offices, and
holy Duties of Divine Worſhip and Service, which I have
too much neglected, as I own to my great Sorrow: Let no

and ſerious Matters; and be, I beſeech you, very
careful and circumſpect in all your Actions, Behaviour and
Converſation, as I earneſtly exhorted all that came to
me.</p>
                  <p>I have, I thank God, a great deal of Satisfaction in my preſent Sufferings, and have found it ſo ever ſince I have been under them: And bleſſed be God it doth continually
increaſe upon me. And I do now lay down my Life with
all Chearfulneſs and Reſignation, in ſure and certain Hope
of a Reſurrection to Eternal Life, through our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, through whoſe Merits alone I hope for the Pardon of
my Sins, and the Salvation of my Soul.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, O Lord, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit, for thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of Truth.</p>

                  <p>IT hath not been my Cuſtom to uſe many Words and I ſhall not be long upon this Occaſion, having Buſineſs of much greater Conſequence to employ my Thoughts upon.
I thank God I am now in a full diſpoſition to Charity, and
therefore ſhall make no Complaints, either of the Hardſhips
of my Tryal, or any other Rigours put upon me. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
one Circumſtance I think my ſelf oblig'd to mention,
it was Sworn againſt me by Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> That I had own'd
to him, that I had Seen and Read a Commiſſion from the
King, to Levy War upon the Perſon of the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi>
Now I muſt declare, That the Tenour of the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
which I ſaw, was General, and directed to all his
Loving Subjects, to Raiſe and Levy War againſt the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Adherents, and to ſeize all Forts, Caſtles,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, I ſuppoſe, may be a cuſtomary Form of giving
Authority to make War; but, I muſt confeſs, I am not
much acquainted with Matters of that Nature: But, as for
any Commiſſion, particularly levelled againſt the Perſon of
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> I neither ſaw nor heard of any ſuch.</p>
                  <p>It's true, I was privy to the Deſign upon the Prince, but was not to act in it; and I am fully ſatisfied, that very few, or none, knew of it, but thoſe who undertook to
do it.</p>
                  <p>I freely acknowledge, and think it for my Honour to ſay, That I was entirely in the Intereſt of the King, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways firmly perſuaded of the Juſtice of his Cauſe, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon it as my Duty, both as a Subject, and an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to Aſſiſt him in the Recovery of his Throne, which I
believed him to be deprived of, contrary to all Right and
Juſtice; taking the Laws and Conſtitution of my Country
for my Guide.</p>
                  <p>As for my Religion, I die in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in which I was Educated.</p>
                  <p>And as I freely forgive all the World, ſo who-ever I may any ways have Injured, I heartily ask them Pardon.</p>

            <p>Here the Bigottry of theſe poor and wretched Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be admired and pitied, that they ſhould juſtifie their Treaſons to the laſt Gaſp, which hot-headed <hi>Charnock</hi> did
not think fit to do. But this can be attributed to nothing
elſe, ſave the blind Zeal and rebellious Principles of thoſe
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:62930:283"/>
Clergy-men that were with them; and who fairly, if they

Abſolution to them without any precedent Confeſſion,

                  <p>IN the firſt place, I die in the Religion I was Baptized, <hi>(viz.) Roman Catholick,</hi> and humbly beg the Prayers of all Good People, for a happy Reſurrection, and of all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
for the Good of my Soul.</p>
                  <p>As for being ingag'd in this for which I die, it was never ſo poſitive that I had a Horſe, from the beginning to the very laſt, nor never ſee any allotted me, or the two Men I was
to provide, as was ſworn againſt me at my Tryal, nor had
I any on that Account; nor was I at any of their Meetings
when they ſettled any ſuch thing. And as for any Order of
Commiſſion from King <hi>James,</hi> I never ſee any ſince I came
laſt into <hi>England,</hi> which is now above 5 Years; and I am
confident none that knows King <hi>James,</hi> will believe he would
give any ſuch Order.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, I muſt confeſs, I believe King <hi>James</hi> was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſert his own Right; and I ſhould, if on Shore, have done any thing in my Power to have aſſiſted him, and in
order to that I ſhould have been very glad to have had a
Horſe, but never had any.</p>
                  <p>And as for being concern'd in any Bloody Affair I never was in my Life, but have done my Endeavour to prevent, as much as I could on all Occaſions; and if the Killing the moſt
miſerable Creature in the World (or greateſt Enemy) would
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:62930:283"/>
now ſave my Life, reſtore the King, and make me one of
the greateſt Men in <hi>England,</hi> I firſt would chuſe to die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
againſt the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>If any who are now Sufferers on this Account, think I have been too forward, and a Promoter of this Deſign, I do now declare, it was never my Inclination to do any raſh
thing. However, I beg their Pardons, and of all the World
I have offended, either in Thought, Word, or any Action
whatſoever, and do freely forgive my Enemies, and hope
through the Mercy of my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of all my Sins. Good God preſerve the King, Queen,
Prince, and Princeſs, and all that Royal Blood of <hi>Stewards,</hi>
and may <hi>England</hi> never want one of that direct Line to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern

<pb n="561" facs="tcp:62930:284"/>
home, and ſafely came upon the Coaſt towards the latter end
of <hi>April,</hi> to the diſſipating of the great Fears we were in,
leſt the <hi>French</hi> Fleet from <hi>Thoulon</hi> ſhould overtake and ruine
him. And indeed, they were not far behind; for before
the Junction of thoſe Men of War we had then in the <hi>Downs</hi>
with ſome of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Squadron, and that he could get up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coaſt of <hi>Breſt,</hi> in order to intercept and fight them,
they were got ſafe into that, and the other Harbours of
<hi>France:</hi> So that the <hi>French</hi> took the Field before the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
to whom they were ſuperiour at firſt in number, till
the Junction of the <hi>German</hi> Troops, who ever came late,
which was at all times a prodigious Diſadvantage to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates:
So that what with theſe things, but moſt of all for
the extream Want of Mony to pay the Army, now our Coin
was called in, the Confederates could not act Offenſively, as
they had done the preceding Year. But about the time that
the King arrived at the <hi>Hague,</hi> there happen'd ſomething
to fall out, which began to ſavour of ſomewhat elſe than the
Toils and Inconveniences of War; for Monſieur <hi>Caillieri</hi> was
come thither, from <hi>France,</hi> with Propoſals towards conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a general Peace, by ſetling ſuch Preliminaries as might
be a ſufficient Baſis to ground a Treaty upon. I do not know
whether there was any real Diſpoſition in the <hi>French</hi> Court
to a general Peace before the Year 1695; but the loſs of
<hi>Namur, Caſall,</hi> and other Diſadvantages, did, without all
doubt, powerfully operate towards it; and nothing could
have retarded their Motions in order to it, but the Plauſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Invaſion againſt <hi>England,</hi> and that in ſuch an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
Juncture, when our Coin was in ſo bad a State. But
the former, as has been related, utterly failing, and a viſible
Proſpect of our weathering the Point as to our Mony, there
was now no Room for, nor Occaſion of Delay. But of theſe
Proceedings, in relation to a general Peace, we ſhall have
Occaſion to ſpeak hereafter, as we ſhall of the particular one
that was at hand, when we have firſt diſpatched our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Affairs.</p>
            <p>Tho' our Armies could do little,<note place="margin">The Bomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Calais, St. Martins,</hi> &amp;c.</note> for the aforeſaid Reaſons, by Land this Campaign, our Fleet was not altogether idle by Sea. I confeſs, the Bombarding of <hi>Calais,</hi> which happen'd
before the Spring of the Year was ſpent, and as ſoon as we
could get our Bomb-veſſels ready, had not that Succeſs that
might have been deſired: However, the Damage was not
ſo inconſiderable as the <hi>French</hi> Gazeteer would have made
it; ſome Letters at that time from <hi>France</hi> owning that there
were 75 Houſes burnt and ſpoiled, beſides the Church and
Convent, and ſome part of the <hi>Cazern.</hi> However, the Fleet
had much better Succeſs in their Attempt upon the Iſle of

               </gap>, where it arrived on the 14th of <hi>July,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:62930:285"/>
of the Lord <hi>Berkeley,</hi> when the Men of War came to
an Anchor, while the Galliots advanced within three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a Mile of <hi>St. Martin's,</hi> in the ſaid Iſland, and at Nine
a Clock at Night they began to bombard it, which ſet the
Town on fire in five ſeveral places, three of which the <hi>French</hi>
made a ſhift to quench, but the other two continued to burn
with great Violence. From Three next Morning, till the
ſame Hour in the Afternoon, they forbore Bombing; at which
time, the Tide ſerving, they began their Work again, which
continued till Four next Morning; whereby the Town was
ſet on fire in ſeveral places, and the greateſt part of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
or deſtroyed; as was alſo a Ship in the Road, beſides
a Feluca laden with Salt and Brandy, which they took at their
coming away. The <hi>French</hi> were in a manner, ſurprized in
this Attempt; ſo that what with that, and the dexterous
Working of our Bombardeers, there was greater Executice
done upon this Town, than any other we had attempted ſince
the Burning of <hi>Diepe;</hi> Tho' they could not ſucceed ſo well
upon <hi>Olonne,</hi> which was next attempted, through a Miſtake
of the Situation of the Place; yet there was conſiderable
Damage done there alſo. But while theſe things were doing
by the Bomb-Galliots and light Frigats, my Lord <hi>Berkeky</hi>
landed in the Iſle of <hi>Groa,</hi> near Port <hi>Louis;</hi> and in two
others, near <hi>Bell</hi> Iſle; where the Soldiers deſtroyed about
20 Villages, burnt 1300 Houſes, and brought away a Booty
of 1600 Head of Cattle. Beſides this, the Fleet took 20
Barks, and a Veſſel from <hi>New-found-land;</hi> and re-took one
of our <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Ships, together with a ſmall Frigat which
the Privateers of <hi>St. Malo's</hi> had taken. And ſo ended our
Summer's Expedition; which, tho' perhaps ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated
on our part, yet certainly, the Damage muſt be
very great; and all the Flouriſhes in the World could not
make it appear to be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Having ſpent ſome Time in this manner, to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Proceedings of our Fleet againſt thoſe Ports of <hi>France</hi> which look towards <hi>Spain,</hi> we ſhall ſee firſt what has

               </note> The Armies were pretty early in the Field on
that ſide, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſtill content to be on the
Defenſive, and perhaps would have been fully ſatisfied to have
lain unmoleſted in their Camp near <hi>Oſtalrick:</hi> But the <hi>French</hi>
were not willing it ſhould be ſo; and therefore, the Duke
<hi>de Vendoſme</hi> having paſſed the <hi>Ter,</hi> and underſtanding that
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cavalry, who had been encamped within their
Lines, were advanced to obſerve him, he reſolved to attack
them firſt, which was done on the firſt Day of <hi>June:</hi> The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> finding none but Horſe appear againſt them in the
Beginning, they ſtoutly ſtood their Ground, and forced ſome
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:62930:285"/>
of the <hi>French</hi> Squadrons to recoil: But when they ſaw their
Numbers increaſe, and a good Party of the Infantry come
up to ſupport them, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought it their beſt way
to retire within their Lines, which they did in very good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
making a Retreating Fight till they got under the Reach
of their own Cannon, where the <hi>French,</hi> greedy of Purſuit,
were but illy entertained by the Artillery, and forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
with conſiderable Loſs. But tho' the <hi>Spaniards</hi> own to
have loſt near 300 Men in all, yet they will have the Loſs of
the <hi>French</hi> to have been greater; which the other would by
no means agree to, tho' they did not ſeem very well ſatisfied
with the Action it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I know of nothing elſe of moment that happen'd this way during the reſt of the Campaign,<note place="margin">The Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </note> and therefore we will croſs the Country, and obſerve that on the ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> there
was nothing memorable that came to paſs: The <hi>French,</hi> in
the Beginning of the Spring, bragged of their paſſing that
River, and forcing the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> to intrench himſelf
in his Camp; to whom they offered Battle, which he durſt
not accept. But now, towards the latter end of the Year,
the Prince, in his Turn, paſſes the <hi>Rhine,</hi> near <hi>Mentz;</hi> and
being joined by the <hi>Heſſian</hi> Troops, he advanced to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt,</hi>
where the <hi>French</hi> lay ſo ſtrongly encamped, that there
was no forcing their Intrenchments: However, he had the
Honour, for ſeveral Days to Cannonade them, not only in
<hi>Newſtadt,</hi> but in the very Trenches themſelves. It was alſo
ſo contrived, that General <hi>Thungen</hi> ſhould have croſſed the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> not far from <hi>Philipsburgh,</hi> in order to have attacked
the <hi>French</hi> in the Rear; But they being aware of it, ſent the
Marquiſs <hi>d' Vxelles</hi> to oppoſe that Deſign: So that the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
failing herein, as alſo in making an Incurſion into <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
with <hi>Palſi</hi>'s Huſſars, after they had got ſome Booty,
and divers Hoſtages for Contribution, they repaſſed that
River on the 8th of <hi>October,</hi> and then marched into their
Winter-Quarters.</p>
            <p>But the main Buſineſs of this Summer ſeemed to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged on the ſide of <hi>Italy;</hi>

and <hi>France;</hi> the Duke, it ſeems, being reſolved, as he came
laſt into the War, to be the firſt that would get out of it;
without any Regard had to his Stipulations with the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
whereof we have already given an Account. I do
take it for granted, that the <hi>French</hi> Army on that ſide, under
the Command of the Mareſchal <hi>de Catinat,</hi> was more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
than uſual, and that they were much ſuperiour in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to the Confederates at the beginning of the Campaign;
But that there was ſome Underſtanding between the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> and the Court of <hi>France</hi> before this, ſeems to be very
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:62930:286"/>
by <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Proceedings; who, notwithſtanding his
Strength, and advancing near <hi>Turin,</hi> unoppoſed, gave the
Duke Time enough to fortifie his Camp, and re-inforce his
Army before the ſaid City, and to draw a Line from the
<hi>Doero,</hi> to the <hi>Po;</hi> which being once effected, the <hi>French</hi> could
not think of Bombarding the Place, or forcing the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
to a Battle. But tho' this Treaty was concerted before,
amidſt the Devotions at <hi>Loretto,</hi> where ſuch a Buſineſs could
be managed without being obſerved by the Miniſters of the
Allies; yet all the Artifice imaginable was made uſe of, to
cover the Matter for a Time. To this End <hi>Catinat,</hi> as we
have ſaid, came from the Mountains of <hi>Savoy,</hi> into the Plains
of <hi>Turin,</hi> threatning the Extirpation of the Name of the <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montois;</hi>
but ſtopped on a ſudden, till he had ſlipped the
Opportunity. And when he found he had given the Duke
Time enough to fortifie himſelf; and, under pretence of
ſtrengthening the Army, had got his Fortreſſes clear of the
Confederate Troops, the Mareſchal removed farther off, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Pignerol;</hi> which occaſioned various Speculations; And
the more Clear-ſighted began to ſuſpect there was an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under-hand patched up between the two Parties: And
there was an Adventure which happen'd much about the
ſame time, that ſufficiently diſcovered the Secrecy of the
<hi>French</hi> Court in the Matter, as well as the Aſſurance they
had of their Work being done on that ſide. There was a
Diſcourſe of ſome Miſ-underſtanding between the Mareſchal
<hi>de Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inat</hi> and the Grand Prior of <hi>France,</hi> while the Army lay
at <hi>Rivalta:</hi> For the Grand Prior urging two or three ſeveral
times, that the Mareſchal had favourable Opportunities to
have gained conſiderable Advantages over the Confederates,
and ſtill deſiring the Mareſchal to make uſe of the Benefit of
of Fortune's Offer, the Mareſchal as often put him off with
Refuſals; which made the other, in the height of his Zeal,
as believing the Mareſchal to be guilty of Negligence or
Cowardice, to write his Accuſations to the <hi>French</hi> King, who
could not forbear ſmiling all the while he read the Letter.
However, he was ſo kind as to ſend him an Anſwer; and to
let him know, that the Mareſchal had obeyed his Orders,
and that he would ſoon ſee the Reaſons of his pretended Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence
unravelled. Not long after this, (on the 12th of
<hi>July,</hi>) a Truce was concluded on for a Month; the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
whereof was, the Exchanging of Hoſtages, and at
laſt, the final Concluſion of a Peace; Which, if it had been
gained on the Duke's part, without any Violation of his
Honour, was very advantageous to him, and the reſt of <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For the <hi>French</hi> made a Reſtitution to him of all the new
Conqueſts they had made, as alſo of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> demoliſhed;

The ſtrict Leagues his noble Anceſtors have heretofore
had with <hi>France,</hi> and the more exact Alliance his Royal Highneſs
has contracted by his Marriage, have but the more disjoyn'd him
from the Intereſt of that Kingdom. This Vnion which ought to
have been the moſt inviolable, we have lately ſeen interrupted by
the Artifices of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's and your Majeſty's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies;
to whom his Royal Highneſs has been hitherto ſo weak
as to give ear. His Royal Highneſs therefore humbly begs Your
Majeſty would pleaſe to pardon his paſt Conduct, ſo very contrary
to his ſincere Deſires to re-eſtabliſh your Majeſty upon your Throne.
The Injuſtice and Oppreſſion of your Enemies, Sir, have cauſed his
moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to engage in this War. God Almighty has
hitherto favour'd his Attempts, becauſe they are juſt; and 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to be hoped he will lend the like Attention to your Majeſty's Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.
His Royal Highneſs, for his part, will contribute all in
his Power thereunto, who likewiſe flatters himſelf, that this Treaty
lately ſigned with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, may be a Means to
divide theſe Princes (whoſe Vnion will infallibly oppoſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Return to your Dominions) which may facilitate a general
Peace, the firſt Effects of which will undoubtedly be your Majeſty's
Re-eſtabliſhment on your Throne. This has been the Occaſion, Sir,
of his Royal Highneſs's withdrawing from the Allies; and which

that one and the ſame Prince, who equals himſelf to
Crown'd Heads, ſhould ſucceſſively in one and the ſame Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
Command the two Armies of two Enemies: This was
a pace none of his Anceſtors ever made, though they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves unconſtant enough between the <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Crowns upon divers occaſions. But ſo it was, that
the Duke marched at the head of his Army, and laid Siege
to <hi>Valentia,</hi> a Citty in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> belonging to
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was carried on with much Vigour
while the Treaty was agitated on both ſides, by the Prince

of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gallaway</hi> for the King of <hi>England,</hi>
and the Marqueſs <hi>de St. Thomas</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
many Conferences were held, before they could be brought
to any Concluſion. But though the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi>
were ſo eager to take <hi>Valentia,</hi> they found an harder thing
of it than was expected, having loſt above 3000 Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, and the approach of the bad Weather and the Winter
Seaſon, made the matter very Dubious at laſt; and things
on all hands were brought to this Criſis on both ſides, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>French</hi> ſhould run the hazzard and Diſhonour that
would accrue to them of raiſing the Siege, or whether the
Confederates would venture the loſing of it, and with that
protract the War in <hi>Italy:</hi> But all Parties having conſidered
the advantages and diſadvantages, the Neutrality was agreed
to, and ſigned upon the 7th of <hi>October,</hi> containing chiefly the
following Articles:</p>
            <p>I. That there ſhall be a Neutrality,<note place="margin">The Articles of Neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <pb n="576" facs="tcp:62930:292"/>
III. That in lieu of Winter Quarters, which the Princes of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
were otherwiſe oblig'd to allow the Imperialiſts, they ſhould fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them with 300000 Crowns; that is to ſay, One third before
their Retreat, and the remainder at a time prefix'd, upon ſufficient
Security.</p>
            <p>IV. That ſo ſoon as the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> ſhould begin to March off with ſome part of their Troops, the <hi>French</hi> ſhould proportionably do the like.</p>
            <p>V. That the Treaty ſhould be ratifyed within two Days by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by the Emperor within a Month, and within two by the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Hereupon the Count of <hi>Theſſe,</hi> and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs

to <hi>Milan</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things being thus concluded on in <hi>Italy,</hi> in reſpect to that particular Peace, there was a mighty Diſcourſe all the while of a general One with the reſt of the Confederates, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Dickvelt</hi>'s going about the ſame time to the King's
Camp, when News came to him of the former, made the
ſame hotly Diſcourſed of; People ſuppoſing he came to His
Majeſty, to give an Account of his Negotiations about that
important Affair: And that which confirmed Men more in
this Opinion, was, That Monſieur <hi>Dickvelt</hi> made this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
more than once between the Camp and the <hi>Hague;</hi> but
this matter we ſhall purſue no further at preſent, it being
time we ſhould proceed to ſee the Operations of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
in <hi>Hungary</hi> this Year.</p>
            <p>The Armies on each ſide were Commanded by the ſame Generals as the preceding Year; the Grand Seignior pretty early in the Summer came to <hi>Belgrade</hi> at the head of very
numerous Troops, while the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> about the
beginning of <hi>June,</hi> joined the Imperial Forces, whom he
found to be ſo good, that according to all the Intelligence at
that time of the Enemies Numbers, he might be able to
fight them, or if they refuſed, to ſit down before ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
place: Whereupon ſeveral Counſels of War were
held, according to Cuſtom, wherein it was reſolved at length
to Beſiege <hi>Themeſwaer,</hi> but whether it were really deſigned
for a formal Siege, or that it was only a feint to draw the
<hi>Mahometans</hi> to a Battle,<note place="margin">

approached the place, viewed it, raiſed Batteries, and in
ſome meaſure made a formal Attack upon the Town; while
advice came in the mean time thick and three-fold, that
the <hi>Sultan</hi> was preparing to croſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> with his whole
Army, which made the Elector glad of the News, riſe from
before <hi>Themeſwaer,</hi> and immediately to ſet forward to meet
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:62930:292"/>
the Infidels. But this proving to be a falſe Rumour, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
returned to attack the place again; though this was
thought to have been done, that the <hi>Turks</hi> might be more
eager to follow him, and indeed the Stratagem took: For
the <hi>Sultan</hi> to divert him from the Siege, came on amain,
which made the Elector to make ſome ſmall motion towards
the Enemy, to the end he might take his meaſures, to obſerve
their Countenance and the Scituation of their Ground; So
that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> continued their march, when on the 21ſt
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> by break of Day, they found the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Chavalry
begin to appear in very great Numbers, which made the
Elector and General <hi>Capara,</hi> to cauſe the Army to march in
order of Battle: But at the ſame time the Infidels came pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down upon the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> from ſeveral parts, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Fury: But they met with ſuch Vigorous reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from every Quarter, that after a ſharp Recounter, they
were forced to retreat, and the <hi>Germans</hi> purſued them cloſe
at their Heels, with an intention to drive them upon their
Infantry, in hopes to have come up with them the ſame
Day, and to have attacked them ſucceſsfully, conſidering
the rout of their Cavalry, but therein they were prevented
by the approach of Night. Next Day which was the 22d,
the Elector ſent a numerous Detachment to obſerve the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
poſture, who gave an account of their being ſtrongly
poſted between two Moraſſes, that ſecured the Wings of their
Army, and that they had planted ſeveral Cannon before them,
and that the avenues of thoſe Moraſſes were almoſt inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Whereupon it was concluded in a Council of War, that
the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> ſhould retreat 3000 Paces towards the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in hopes to draw the <hi>Turks</hi> out of their Entrenchments,
which was done next Day in order of Battle. On the 24th
the Enemies appeared with a great part of their Army, but
drew a new and third line ſo ſpeedily, that it was finiſhed
before the <hi>Germans</hi> could fall upon them, ſo that there was
no more done that Day, but Cannonading one anothers
Camps: On the 24th the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> made ſome little
motion, and fell down into a Plain, having a River behind
them in hopes to draw the Enemy out of their Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet that would not do neither: But upon the 25th,
the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had advice, upon the return of their advanced
Guards,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a compaſs to fall upon the right Wing, being covered by
a thick Wood, which was in part cut through, and ſeparated
the Enemy from that right Wing about a Leagues diſtance.
It was thought at firſt to have been only ſome Detachment,
but the Imperial Generals coming out with ſome Horſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Diſcovery, found it to be the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:62930:293"/>
marching in a full Body towards them, and this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by a Priſoner that was taken immediately after.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Imperial Army was ranged in Order of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, with a Deſign to go and meet the Enemy; but they made ſo much ſpeed, that before the <hi>Germans,</hi>

the Woods, the <hi>Turks</hi> had poſted themſelves upon one Line

upon their own Left Wing, which was the Reaſon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts

while the Body of the Army advanced at the ſame time

on the other, and having firſt put them to the Rout,
broke in upon the Second Line, but they were ſtopped ſhort
by the Infantry, till the firſt Line was Cloſed again by ſome
Regiments of Horſe that were ſent for from the other ſide,
upon which, the ſame Regiments vigorouſly Repreſſed the
Enemy, but were hindred (as was ſaid,) from purſuing them
by ſome unknown Order: However, ſome other Regiments
of Horſe purſued them with extraordinary Courage, even to
their Barricades. Upon this there was ſome Foot immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
detached away, not only to ſupply the place which the
Regiments of Horſe had left void in the firſt Line, but to
ſecond them, and to endeavour both together, to force the
Enemies Waggon-Barricades: But the Janiſaries fired ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly

and being purſued by the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Retreat was ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
that another Regiment of Horſe was quite put out of

to their Relief, Charged the Enemy in Flank, and
drove them back again to their Barricades with ſo much loſs
and confuſion, that the Grand Seignior, who Commanded a
Reſerve of about 3000 Men in Perſon, at a little diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Barricades, had much adoe to ſtop the Run-a-ways,
and to prevent his other Troops from forſaking the ſaid
Barricade; But Night coming on, it was not thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to Attack them in their Barricades. However, the
Elector kept the Army upon the Field of Battle at their
Arms all Night, and offered the Sultan Battle next Day,
which the other declined, and ſo ended this Battle, than which
there has not been any one Fought with more Reſolution and
Bravery on both ſides, in this Age, and it ſeemed to have
been like a drawn Battle. The Loſs in all appearance was
not very different, for, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did not make the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
loſs to exceed 4000 Men, and when they themſelves
on the other Hand have owned their's to have been about
3000, ſome ſmall Deduction, for Partiallity will make it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

yet the Succeſs Count <hi>Barthiani,</hi> Governour of <hi>Croatia,</hi> had

the Gulph of <hi>Eugenia</hi> with the Gallies and Galleaſſes, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

But this Conjunction, thro the Badneſs of the Weather, could
not be till the 21ſt, at what time the General calling a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of War, it was reſolved to fall upon the Enemy, and to
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:62930:294"/>
this purpoſe, to Tow their Men of War with their Gallies,
becauſe of the Calm. But becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> cauſed the Men
of War to be Towed in like manner by their Galliots, and
Long Barks towards the Golden Cape, it was 19 of the
Clock, according to the <hi>Italian</hi> way of reckoning, before the
Vanguard of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, conſiſting of 8 Men of War,
could come up with them. However, tho' they had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of keeping their Fleet cloſe upon a Line, whereas
the Body of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet could not get up, becauſe
of the Calm, <hi>Molino</hi> engaged the Left Wing of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Fleet, whilſt the 8 above-mentioned Veſſels, and Galleaſſes,
fell upon the Right with extraordinary Vigour and Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
The Fight continued till it was very dark, when the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Line was broke, and their Fleet began to bear away
with all the Sail they could make, and got next day into the
Port of <hi>Scio,</hi> where they ſtaid two days longer to Refit:
Three of their Ships being ſo battered, that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to take out their Guns, and Three of their Galliots, and
a Sultana loſt in the Fight, with 600 Men killed, beſides
ſeveral wounded: But the <hi>Venetians</hi> loſt never a Veſſel, and
but a very few Men. From thence General <hi>Molino</hi> ſailed
back to <hi>Andros,</hi> thence to <hi>Fina,</hi> or <hi>Tenos</hi> in the Gulph of
<hi>Evenay,</hi> but they got ſafe into <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and <hi>Molino</hi> had no
more to do than to return to <hi>Napoli di Romania.</hi> It cannot
be expected there ſhould have been any great Feats done,
more eſpecially this Year, by the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Arms, ſince the
whole Kingdom wanted an Head to govern it, (the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Elective) by the Death of its brave King <hi>John Sobieski,</hi>
the Third of that Name;<note place="margin">The death of the King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </note> who departed this Life on the
17th Day of <hi>June,</hi> of an Apoplectick Fit, being above 70
Years of Age. His Deceaſe (as it uſually happens in ſuch
Caſes) was attended with much Confuſion, (which frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
falls out in Elective Kingdoms) becauſe of the Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
making Parties, and other Humours that break forth
thereupon. But of this we ſhall have Occaſion to ſpeak
hereafter; and therefore, leaving at preſent the Cardinal
Primate to take upon him the Adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we will paſs into <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> of which Empire we have
hitherto had little to ſay; But now you will hear of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>For whereas we heard nothing all along before,<note place="margin">The Czar of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> routs the <hi>Turks</hi> by Sea, and takes <hi>Aſoph.</hi>
               </note> but the Marching of their Armies into the Field, without any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Undertaking, it was otherwiſe this Campaign; For
the Czar, <hi>Peter Alexowitz,</hi> in whom the whole Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Government was now lodged, marched in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
at the Head of a moſt numerous Army, and laid Siege
to <hi>Aſoph,</hi> a Place of great Importance, and conſiderable
Strength, upon the River <hi>Tanais;</hi> which he carried on with
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:62930:295"/>
great Vigour, and which Place the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who knew the
Conſequences of it, were very deſirous to relieve. Of this
the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> were aware, and therefore they ordered nine
Gallies, and ſome other Veſſels, by way of Prevention, to lie
before the Mouth of the <hi>Tanais:</hi> But the Water being too
ſhallow for the Gallies to ſtir, the Czar no ſooner underſtood
that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſels were in ſight, but he immediately
put 2000 Men on board the light Barks, who preſently met
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Convoy, and fell upon them with ſo much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Reſolution, that of three Veſſels, one was ſunk,
and the other two betook themſelves to Flight. Ten large
Saiquies, which were about to make their Eſcape in the
ſame manner, were caſt upon the Sands by contrary Winds;
and, after a faint Reſiſtance, were maſter'd by the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites;</hi>
the <hi>Turks</hi> endeavouring to ſave themſelves, ſome by
Swimming, and others in their Shallops. To this Succeſs
of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> if you add the Booty, it makes the thing
yet the more conſiderable; for they found in the Saiques
all the Proviſions deſigned for <hi>Aſoph,</hi> Clothes for the whole
Garriſon, a vaſt Quantity of Powder, and a great Number
of Pikes and Swords, together with a conſiderable Quantity
of Silk and Silver Stuffs: So that every Soldier of the 2000
had, for his Share, 6 Piaſters; the reſt being divided among
the Officers and other Soldiers, the Czar reſerving only the
Cannon and Ammunition to himſelf. This being happily
effected, the Siege of <hi>Aſoph</hi> was carried on with great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
which all the Endeavours of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi>
could not relieve by Land, they being routed in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and a great many of their Number ſlain: So that it
was ſurrender'd to the Czar, upon Articles, on the 28th of
<hi>July;</hi> in purſuance of which, the Garriſon, conſiſting of
3000 Men, beſides <hi>Tartars,</hi> marched out, with their Arms
and Baggage; and preſently the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> marched in, and
found 90 Pieces of Cannon, together with a great Quantity of
Ammunition, in the Town; But want of Proviſions haſten'd
the Surrender of it. The News hereof no ſooner arrived at
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but it occaſioned a great Conſternation there;
and more eſpecially, for fear of loſing thoſe Supplies of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
which uſually come to that City by the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea;
which the Loſs of that Place opened a Gap for the <hi>Moſcovites</hi>
to be Maſters of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now, after ſo long a Peregrination, 'tis time we ſhould return homewards, and take notice, That the State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in</hi> Flanders <hi>this Year being already given an Account of,
it gave the King an Opportunity of returning to</hi> England
<hi>ſomewhat ſooner than uſual, and the Parliament to meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the middle of</hi> Octob. <hi>to whom his Majeſty ſaid,</hi> That he
thought it our Happineſs, conſidering the Diſappointments in the
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:62930:295"/>
Funds, and other Difficulties we laboured under, that Things had
paſſed without any Diſadvantage; That this was a convincing
Proof of the good Diſpoſition of his Army,<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the King his Speech to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and ſteady Affections
of his People; That the Enemy's Hopes had been hitherto fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,
in reſpect to the difficult Conjuncture we were in; and
that their unanimous Proceedings was the Way to have the ſame
continued; That the Buſineſs before them was very great, and our
Occaſions preſſing; That he could not let ſlip the Occaſion, to tell
them, That ſome Overtures had been made towards ſetting up a
Negotiation of a General Peace: But that the beſt Way to Treat,
was, with our Swords in our Hands, and by ſhewing our ſelves
prepared to make a vigorous and effectual War. Wherefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
earneſtly to the Commons, to take Care for Raiſing
the neceſſary Supplies with Speed: As he did alſo the Remedying
of ſome Inconveniences ſtill remaining, in Relation to the State
of the Coin. <hi>And</hi> ſo he concluded, as we ſhall alſo conclude
the Year, with leaving the Parliament to take care in the firſt
place of this laſt Clauſe of his Majeſty's Speech, about the
Coin; and to make a ſtrict Enquiry, among other Things,
into the late Conſpiracy, which took them up much Time:
And of which, but very briefly, before we haſten to give an
Account of the General Peace. Yet we will obſerve firſt,
as we were wont to do,</p>
            <p>That this Year proved fatal to <hi>Mary Anne</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The death of the Qu. Mother of <hi>Spain.</hi>

conſidering her great Influence over the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Counſels, to
make them take ſuch Reſolutions as were conformable to

ſhe was but little beloved in <hi>France;</hi> and gave Occaſion for

proceeded vigorouſly to other Methods for carrying on

with a conſiderable Interruption therein, by the Buſineſs of
Sir <hi>John Fenwicke,</hi> who was one of the Conſpirators in the
late Plot, for invading the Land and taking away the King's
Life; and was deſigned to have been tried at the Common
Law, as the reſt had been; But there were ſome Accidents
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:62930:296"/>
fell out which made his Caſe extraordinary, and brought it
into Parliament; of which take this ſhort Account.</p>
            <p>Upon Sir <hi>John Fenwicke</hi>'s Apprehenſion, which was in <hi>Kent,</hi> as he deſigned to have made his Eſcape that way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, it did appear by a Letter of his writ to his Lady
thereupon, and which hapned to come in the Governments
Hands; That he was ſo far ſenſible of his Guilt and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that he propoſed no other way for the preſent to Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
than by either getting a Jury Pack'd that would be
Obſtinate, and not bring him in Guilty, or making Friends
to the King for a Pardon or Reprieve, at leaſt to gain Time.
But after his being brought to Town, Commitment to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
and farther Conſulting with his Friends, the ſaid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
being found not very Practicable, there was another
Topick reſolved upon, which had a much more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Proſpect of Succeſs; and that was, to ſet up a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot,
by accuſing a great many of the King's beſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Friends to have been guilty of Conſpiring againſt him,
which ſtartled a great many People at firſt, not knowing who
and who was together: And tho' the ſame, in the dilatory
Managements of it, did for a time with Sir <hi>John,</hi> to gain him
Space to have his Tryal put off; yet he could not be but ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
it would not do always, and therefore there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Game for him to Play before he could conceive himſelf
out of Danger; which was, to ſeduce away one at leaſt of
the Evidences that had ſwore the Treaſon againſt him, as
well knowing, according to the late Act, one was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in Caſes of High Treaſon: And this being alſo effected
in the Perſon of <hi>Cardell Goodman,</hi> who privately withdrew
into <hi>France,</hi> the Danger ſeemed now to be quite over, tho'
they could have been glad, both for his and others ſake, that
Captain <hi>Porter</hi> alſo had been got to the ſame or a worſe
Place; and made Overtures to him by a raſcally Iriſh-man,
one <hi>Clancy</hi> by Name, to that end. But he proved ſtanch
againſt the great Temptation, and made a Diſcovery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
unto the Government: So that the Government thereby
finding it ſelf horribly abuſed by theſe Clandeſtine Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and no room left to bring the Criminal, by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Courſe of Law, to a Condign Puniſhment; The King
thought fit to give leave to Admiral <hi>Raſſell</hi> to acquaint the

which were given in by Sir <hi>John Fenwicke,</hi> in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Informations, againſt himſelf and ſeveral Perſons of
Quality, and deſired that the ſame might be read, that ſo
he might have an Opportunity to juſtifie himſelf; or if he
did not, to fall under the Cenſure of the Houſe. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
being read, Sir <hi>John</hi> was immediately ordered to be

<pb n="585" facs="tcp:62930:296"/>
concerning his Inclinations to make a Diſcovery of the
Deſigns and Practiſes of the Enemies of the Government,
with a Promiſe of Favour, if he were Ingenious therein; yet
finding by all the Anſwers he made, he did nothing but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate
with the Houſe, alledging the King knew already
what he had diſcovered; and that he could not be ſafe to
tell them any thing without aſſurance of Security for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
They ordered a Bill to be brought in to Attaint him
of High Treaſon, which was carried by a great Majority in

received a Letter from Sir <hi>John Fenwicke,</hi> importing, That
having received a Copy of the Bill with the Houſe's Order
thereupon, he deſired ſuch Counſel and Sollicitor, as he
therein named, might be allowed him. The ſame was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

to have been concerned in <hi>Goodman</hi>'s Eſcape.</p>
            <p>The firſt debate that hapned upon Sir <hi>John</hi>'s being brought to the Bar of the Houſe, was concerning the Mace, whether it ſhould lie on the Table while he was in the Houſe, or
whether the Sergeant ought to ſtand by him with it at the

the Council, in managing of Evidence againſt Sir <hi>John Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi>
be allowed to produce Evidence touching the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of the Bill, and the Treaſons for which he was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
which was carried in the Affermative; and the

               </gap>
the King's Council produced the Record of <hi>Clancy</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:62930:297"/>
thereupon; and ſo proceeded to <hi>Goodman</hi>'s Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
taken under the Hand of Mr. <hi>Vernon,</hi> which they
prayed might be read, but the Priſoner's Council oppoſed
it as a thing unallowable and impracticable, the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
Perſons to appear and give their Evidence, <hi>viva
voce,</hi> &amp;c. and the Houſe entred into an hot Debate upon it;
But at length it was carried, the ſaid Imformation ſhould be
read, and next that ſome of Grand Jury ſhould give an
account upon what Evidence they found the Bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that was thereupon brought in againſt Sir <hi>John Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence they proceeded to the Record of the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Mr. <hi>Cook;</hi> and when the Council on both ſides had ſpoke to it, and the Houſe debated the ſame, it was more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
agreed, That the ſaid Record ſhould be read, and the
King's Council allowed to examine Witneſſes as to what
<hi>Goodman</hi> ſwore at the Tryal of <hi>Cook;</hi> which being over, and
ſome Queſtions asked concerning the forementioned Letter
of Sir <hi>John Fenwicke,</hi> it was agreed, the Priſoner's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
if they had any Witneſſes to examine on his Behalf,
might do it that Night; but that as to their Obſervations,
the Houſe would give them time till next Morning: This
they, having none except a Record to produce, accepted
of, and indeed ſaid as much in Behalf of their Client as could
have been expected; wherein, however, they were as nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
anſwered by Mr. Sergeant <hi>Gould,</hi> but I have not room
to Cite the Arguments: And ſo I proceed to ſhew that
Sir <hi>John</hi> and the Council being ordered to withdraw, and
upon the Motion of ſome of the more aggrieved Members,
that the Priſoner ſhould deal clearly and candidly with the
Houſe, in giving an account of what he knew concerning
ſeveral Perſons of great Quality, againſt whom he had given
in the Informations formerly mentioned, and he declining of
the ſame, it was reſolved Mr. <hi>Vernon</hi> ſhould give in his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in reſpect to Sir <hi>John</hi>'s getting his Tryal delayed by
Offers of Information, and that in his and the Counſels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
on both ſides: And the Counſel having no more to
ſay, they were diſcharged from their farther Attandance at
that time, and the Order of the Day for reading of the
Bill a ſecond time being read by the Clerk, and the ſame
being afterwards opened by the Speaker, and having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
for ſome time, and no member riſing up to ſpeak,
he asked whether he ſhould put the Queſtion of Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But then the Speaker had his Belly full on't, and
the Debate ran very high both on the one ſide and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
about the extraordinary Method of Proceedings, the
Power and Juſtice of Parliaments, compared with other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Courts of Judicature, with many Preſidents of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:62930:298"/>
Bills of Attainder, <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con;</hi> and other Arguments
that fell in, which are too tedious for me particularly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon. But upon the whole, towards Eleven at Night,
the Reſult was, That the Bill ſhould be Committed, and on
<hi>Friday</hi> the 20th, the Houſe reſolved it ſelf into a Committee
of the whole Houſe upon the ſaid Bill, and ſeveral Words
having been offered as an Amendment to it, importing Sir
<hi>John Fenwicke</hi>'s being Guilty, at laſt theſe Words [<hi>of which
the ſaid Sir</hi> John Fenwicke <hi>is Guilty</hi>] were agreed on to be
added to the Cloſe thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> the 25th, the Bill was read the third time, when the Conteſtation upon the Debate run as hot as ever, and the Members were no leſs divided in their Opinions than before;
but at length the Queſtion for Paſſing the Bill being put,
the Houſe divided thereupon, when there appearing for it
an Hundred Eighty Nine, and but an Hundred and Fifty
Six againſt it, it paſſed in the Affirmative. It's obſervable,
that tho' the Crime wherewith Sir <hi>John Fenwicke</hi> was Charged,
was of the higheſt Nature that could be againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
yet that very many moſt honourable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Perſons in both Houſes, and ſuch as are well known to
be his Majeſty's beſt Friends, were very ſtiff againſt the
Bill. Yet that did not ariſe from any Intentions in them to
Acquit the Guilty, but they could not be ſatisfied with the
manner of procedure, and that of there being but one <hi>vivi
voce</hi> Witneſs only, ſtuck hard upon them; eſpecially, ſince
in all ordinary Courts, two were always required for the
Proof of ſuch a Crime; and that there had been an Act
made but the very Seſſions before, that did poſſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the ſame in Caſes of High Treaſon: And it was looked
upon very ſtrange by ſome, that ſuch a Preſident ſhould be
ſo quickly made, and that in ſuch a good Reign; and the
ſame might prove of very dangerous Conſequence to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Subject in future. Times, which they ſhould be
always very regardful of: But however the Matter were,
Sir <hi>John</hi> was Beheaded for it, and none of them thought him
unjuſtly to ſuffer, though many boggled at the manner of
his Condemnation. At the Place of Execution he deliver'd
the following Paper to the Sheriffs.</p>

                  <head>A true Copy of the Paper Delivered by Sir John
Fenwicke, Baronet, to the Sheriffs of London
and Middleſex, on Tower-Hill, the Place of
Execution, on <date>Thurſday January the 28th, 1697.</date>
                  </head>
                  <p>SPeaking nor Writing was never my Talent. I ſhall therefore give a very Short, but Faithful Account, firſt, of my Religion; and next, what I ſuffer moſt innocently
for, to avoid the Calumnies I may reaſonably expect my
Enemies will caſt upon me when dead, ſince they have moſt
falſely and maliciouſly aſperſed me whilſt under my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
                  <p>As for my Religion, I was brought up in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is eſtabliſh'd by Law, and have ever profeſs'd it; tho' I confeſs I have been an unworthy Member of it,
in not living up to the ſtrict and excellent Rules thereof,
for which I take Shame to my ſelf, and humbly ask For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
of GOD. I come now to dye in that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
truſting, as an humble and hearty Penitent, to be
received by the Mercy of God, through the Merits of Jeſus
Chriſt my Saviour.</p>
                  <p>My Religion taught me my Loyalty, which, I bleſs God, is untainted: And I have ever endeavoured, in the Station wherein I have been placed, to the utmoſt of my Power, to
ſupport the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in the True and Lineal Courſe
of Deſcent, without interruption.</p>
                  <p>As for what I am now to dye; I call God to witneſs, I went not to that Meeting in <hi>Leadenhall-ſtreet</hi> with any ſuch intention, as to invite King <hi>James</hi> by Force to invade this
Nation; nor was I my ſelf provided with either Horſe or
Arms, or engaged for any number of Men, or gave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Conſent foy any ſuch Invaſion, as is moſt falſely
Sworn againſt me.</p>
                  <p>I do alſo declare, in the Preſence of God, That I knew nothing of King <hi>James's</hi> coming to <hi>Calais,</hi> nor of any Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion intended from thence, till it was publickly known: And
the only Notion I had that ſomething might be attempted,
was from the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Fleet coming to <hi>Breſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I alſo call God to witneſs, that I received the knowledge of what is contained in thoſe Papers that I gave to a great Man that came to me in the <hi>Tower,</hi> both from Letters and
Meſſages that came from <hi>France;</hi> and he told me, when I
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ead them to him, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uainted
with moſt of thoſe things before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="590" facs="tcp:62930:299"/>
I might have expected Mercy from that Prince, becauſe I
was Inſtrumental in ſaving his Life. For when about <hi>April,</hi>
95. an Attempt formed againſt him, came to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
I did, partly by Diſſuaſions, and partly by Delays,
prevent that Deſign; which I ſuppoſe was the Reaſon that
the laſt Villanous Project was concealed from me.</p>
                  <p>If there be any Perſons whom I have injur'd in Word o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Deed, I heartily pray their Pardon, and beg of God to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
thoſe who have injured me; particularly thoſe who with
great Zeal have ſought my Life, and brought the guilt of my
Innocent Blood upon this Nation, no Treaſon being proved
upon me.</p>
                  <p>I return my moſt hearty Thanks to thoſe Noble and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Perſons who gave me their Aſſiſtance by oppoſing this Bill of Attainder, without which, it had been impoſſible I
could have fallen under the Sentence of Death. God bleſs
them and their Poſterity; though I am fully ſatisfied they
Pleaded their own Cauſe while they Defended mine.</p>
                  <p>I pray God to bleſs my True and Lawful Sovereign King <hi>James,</hi> the Queen, and Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Reſtore him and his Poſterity to this Throne again, for the Peace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of this Nation, which is impoſſible to proſper till the

the <hi>French</hi> had done their work in the Reduction of <hi>Aeth,</hi>
which tho' it gave ſome farther Reputation to their Arms

               </hi> was deſigned by
them to retard, but rather to quicken the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pace
towards a Peace; So that the Conferences between their Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries

of the Young King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> now his Father <hi>Charles</hi> XI. of
that Name had died on the 17th of <hi>April</hi> this Spring, by the
intervention of the Baron <hi>de Lillieroot</hi> his Ambaſſador, who
went between the one and the other for the ſaid purpoſe.
After the Allies had made their Pretenſions, they drew up
a large Deduction, in juſtification of them, of which they
reſolved to give the <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries no Copy, until
they had Declared, that they had received the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to make theirs. But theſe ſame Plenipotentiaries,
having Declared, that they had nothing to ask or pretend
to, and that they were ready to Anſwer the others. The
Allies changed their Thoughts, the <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries
having in the mean time had ſeveral ſeparate Conferences
with thoſe of the States General, about Commerce, and a
Ceſſation of Arms, which the former ſhewed themſelves
very eager for; But there was but little appearance, that
this laſt point ſhould then have been agreed to, ſeeing
the Peace was more likely to be Retarded than Advanced
thereby.</p>

the Treaty went on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Ceremonial part, being

with the Miniſters of the States General, and of the

of the Allies to their King, while the Confederates
proteſted, <hi>That they would not be put by their right, but that they

            <p>About this time it was,<note place="margin">Alterations about the Baſis of the preſent Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aty.</note> the Plenipotentiaries of the States General, Declared aloud with ſome ſort of Indignation, That it was an unjuſt and falſe Report that was ſpread abroad, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their Maſters having underhand concluded upon their
Affairs with <hi>France:</hi> And that they might ſtill make a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
appearance of their juſt Comportment and Sincerity; they
openly diſwaded the Miniſters of the Allies from conſenting
to a Truce with <hi>France,</hi> to which they were of themſelves
deaf enough, and the rather, for that the <hi>French</hi> had rejected
the Pretentions of the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as being not
willing to anſwer the ſame, before the Confederates gave
their Opinions concerning the Propoſitions <hi>France</hi> had made,
which were; That the Plenipotentiaries of the Allies ſhould

and advance no other Points ſave thoſe whereof there had
been mention made before, to the end there might be a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
and Foundation made for a Treaty; the which Propoſals
being not yet agreed upon (ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> gave out, the
Neutrality in <hi>Catalonia</hi> was concluded on) the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> did
afterwards make anſwer, That theſe Propoſitions were but
preliminary ones and not abſolute, and that they were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, but upon this Condition; that in caſe any one point
were found to be imperfect or faulty, the ſame ought to
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:62930:302"/>
be amended by the ſucceeding Treaties. To this was alſo
added, That they were very deſirous to know the anſwer
of the <hi>French,</hi> as to every particular point propoſed by the
Emperor and his Allies. Theſe Articles were allowed of,
but not to be inſerted in the firſt project of the Emperors
Plenipotentiaries, and the ſame was admitted at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of the States Ambaſſadors, as being ſome what more
particularly relating to their Intereſt, and that of <hi>England.</hi>
But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were of Opinion, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ought to keep cloſe
to the points that had been once agreed on, and that to do
otherwiſe, would but retard the Negotiation: And ſeeing
that the firſt preliminary point agreed on, did import, that
the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> ſhould be the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
and Foundation of this Negotiation, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
conſent of the <hi>French</hi> King; It was conſequently very
evident, that thoſe Preliminary Poſitions, could not be the
foundation of all pretenſions that the Allies could have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>France:</hi> But on the other hand, if the preceding Treaties
had no Effect at all, it was then in vain that they had made
choiſe of a place to confer in; That the <hi>French</hi> had better have
ſtaid in <hi>Paris,</hi> and that it was to no purpoſe that Paſports
had been granted, and the aſſiſtance and mediation of the
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> deſired; That the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were amazed,
that ſo unneceſſary a Difficulty ſhould have been raiſed, in ſo
clear and evident a thing, to which was alſo added; That
they did not doubt, but that the Mediator and the States,
were of the ſame Opinion, that ſame point having been long
enough Debated in the Preliminaries, and terminated in a
general and unanimons Conſent. This was no ſooner over,
but that the <hi>French</hi> diſpatched a Courier to their Maſter,
on whoſe part there were Propoſals made again concerning a
Truce, and a free Trade, as being the firſt ſtep towards a
Peace. But theſe things came to nothing, ſo that the <hi>French</hi>
Embaſſadors, now replying to thoſe Anſwers made by the
<hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſaid; that they were ſo ſtrictly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their Inſtructions, that they durſt not any manner
of way exceed or change any thing from the Treaty of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
as the Baſis propoſed unto them by their King, and
that conſequently it was in vain for the Allies to require any
thing beyond the Articles of the ſaid Treaty, ſeeing their
King would grant them no power for it; with which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of theirs, the Allies were ſo far from being ſatisfied,
that they gave them to underſtand by the Mediator, that
their anſwer was frivolous, and had no other tendency in it,
than to break off the Treaty, or at leaſt to protract it: This
their Declaration being directly contrary, to what had been
fully regulated, and abſolutely agreed on in the Prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies;
and the Mediator himſelf being of the ſame Sentiments,
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:62930:302"/>
he did thereupon lay the full Pretentions of the Allies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the French Plenipotentiaries, who made him anſwer,
That the retarding of the Negotiation, ſhould with much
Reaſon be attributed to the Allies, the laſt Inſtrument that
had been preſented on the Emperor's part, being conceived
in ſuch Articles, which they foreſaw <hi>France</hi> neither could,
nor ought to accept. Beſides this, they ſaid, the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
thought it more convenient, to take the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the Baſis of this, which propoſition, ſaid they, was
the cauſe that made the French inſiſt upon that of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen.</hi>
To this the Mediator replied, That he could not
believe that the French King was offended, That all and
ſingular the Allies had joined together in the laſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
as in an Affair that was common to them all; That
they were of Opinion, <hi>France</hi> would have declared the ſame
thing, were ſhe in the ſame Condition <hi>Spain</hi> found her ſelf
in, to wit, that the Peace of the <hi>Pyrenaees</hi> ſhould be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in its full force. The Allies alſo offered it as their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that for the avoiding of all theſe Difficulties and
Diſputes, they thought it would be better the French ſhould
anſwer each of their Propoſitions a-part, which was at length
agreed unto.</p>
            <p>The Imperialiſts, in purſuance to this Reſolution, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Mediator, a Project of the Method to be uſed of Treating by Word of Mouth, without any difficulty, which
being read firſt to the Confederates, and a Copy of the ſaid
being afterwards delivered unto them, before it was ſhewed
to the French Plenipotentiaries; but that ſame Copy being
ſome-what delayed, the other diſcontented Allies took an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Reſolution, to Remonſtrate to the Imperialiſts, that
themſelves had alſo a ſhare in the Alliance, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they ought to have Deliberated with them concerning
the Points propoſed, as well on the Emperor's part, as on
that of <hi>France:</hi> Yet things could not be brought ſo to bear,
but the Embaſſage of the Empire agreed on at <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi>
was fruſtrated of the Effect of its Vote. About the ſame
time, the Mediator at the Requeſt of the Imperialiſts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the French Plenipotentiaries the making choice of
ſome other Days, beſides the ordinary Ones, to hold their
Conferences on, in order to haſten the finiſhing of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation.
But the latter, ſuppoſing the Allies had ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
End in the ſame Propoſal, made anſwer, They were
not at Liberty to Comply with this Requeſt, but that they
were always ready to Appear at the Appointed Times.</p>
            <p>The laſt Inſtruments preſented by the Imperialiſts, were not pleaſing to divers of the Allies, who affirmed, they had juſt Complaints to make, in order to Redreſs. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Hanover</hi>'s Plenipotentiary inſiſting, he ought to have
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:62930:303"/>
a place in the Aſſembly, as an Electoral Miniſter, occaſioned
alſo ſome Diſpute, but the ſame being left to the Deciſion
of the Mediator, he gave it in favour of him. Soon after,
the Imperialiſts, and the French, gave in reſpectively their
Projects of Peace; but all the Articles of the French, being
drawn word for word from the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the
ſame were rejected by the Allies, as being too oppoſite
to the Intereſts of the Empire, with which, they could
never Acquieſce, as alſo becauſe there was often mention
made not only of the Allies of the Empire, but alſo
of thoſe of <hi>France:</hi> It being notoriouſly known they had
no ſuch in the War, unleſs the <hi>Turks</hi> were meant by it;
wherefore it was inſiſted upon, that the French ſhould more
fully Explain themſelves, and give in a clearer Project: For
they would not allow of Mental Reſervations, nor obſcure,
or equivocal Terms. But for all this, the French in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>July,</hi> required the Mediator to Exhort the Allies,
to admit of no delay, and apply themſelves effectually to the
Terminating of this tedious Work. To whom the Mediator
made anſwer, That he did not ſee how the Allies Retarded
the removing of thoſe Points that were undecided, but that
it behoved the <hi>French,</hi> to look to that, for all their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;
and added further, that the Allies had for a long
time declared the ſincere Intentions they had towards it, but
that the French had not done anſwerable thereto; and that
they had ſent thoſe Points to <hi>Paris,</hi> in order to Conſult the
King thereupon. That the ſincere Intention of the Allies,
was manifeſted, from their having deſired other Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Days ſhould be appointed to hold their Conferences,
which the French, on their part, had declined; That the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
were not ignorant therein of the Deſigns of the French
Court, who had nothing in view, ſave the Peace of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
and if that failed, endeavoured to delay things till ſuch
time as the Allies had found out a Mean that was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contrary to the ſaid Treaty, tho' there might be ſome
accidental Differences in it. As ſoon as the Mediator had
given an account of all this to the Allies, they reſolved to
Confer with one another Daily, in order to find out a way,
to ſhorten their Buſineſs; and in the firſt Conference, it was
concluded, the French ſhould anſwer to every Point in Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as propoſed by the Allies, which, when the other
came to know, they deſired to be informed according to what
manner the Allies were willing to decide the firſt Point, to
the end that having once ſeen the beginning of the Treaty,
they might be able to Conjecture whether they had Power
enough to Treat, and Conclude without any further Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
from their King. But the French at the next Meeting had
ſtill ſomewhat of the old haunt, and inſiſted, that in order
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:62930:303"/>
to add a greater Weight to the Buſineſs, nothing was more
likely to do it, than to Treat according to the Peace of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen,</hi>
and to change ſome Articles therein, according to
the deſire of the Allies. But the Mediator, at the Requeſt of
the Allies, reply'd, That they were not to Treat alone, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> but alſo according to
that of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> as being them two together that had been
reciprocally Propoſed, and Accepted of in the Preliminaries,
as the Baſis of this Negotiation, and that conſequently, the
Allies required that the French ſhould Form a Project ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thoſe two Treaties, to the which the Imperialiſts
would promiſe a quick Anſwer: The Anſwer of the French,
was, that this requir'd time to deliberate upon it, which,
while they were doing, the Imperial Embaſſadors promiſed
to thoſe of the Electors, that they would ſoon Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to them all the Articles they ſhould put forwards, to
the end all Differences between them might be removed.</p>
            <p>The French, after divers Conſultations, declared, They had not ſufficient Power to anſwer to the different Propoſals of the Imperialiſts, but that they would give in a Project to
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> if they would accept of it, which the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
acquainted the Allies with, as alſo, that the French ſaid,
they had no other Power to Treat than according to the
Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen.</hi> But the Allies aſtoniſh'd thereat, came
in a particular Conference to an unanimous Reſolution, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to conſent to it; the ſame Treaty being contrary to the
Intereſts of almoſt all the Allies. And tho' they would not
entirely Reject the ſaid Treaty, yet they had rather that a
Project ſhould be Formed according to it, and that of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Other Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſis of the preſent Treaty.</note>
In the mean time, the Electoral Miniſters could not
well digeſt this Propoſal of the Imperialiſts, that in Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Ceſſions, there ſhould be no regard had to any
other, ſave the Embaſſadors of the higheſt Characters, for
they inſiſted, that they ought to be Treated with, upon an
equal Foot with the reſt: Hereupon the French declared,
they would uſe the Elector's Embaſſadors in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as the Emperor's Plenipotentiaries did, and that they
would Honour the reſt in all Publick Acts, in ſuch a manner
as ſhould give no occaſion of Complaint. But to the main
of the Treaty; the Spaniards did at laſt conſent that the
French ſhould give in their Project, to which they would
make an Anſwer, which they were brought to do, upon an
Aſſurance from the Mediator, that the ſame ſhould be made
up of the Treaty of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and <hi>Nimeguen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
at the ſame time, put the French in mind, that they
ought to propoſe their Articles in ſuch a manner, as to leave
no Repugnancy between them and the Plenipotentaries;
and to be regulated according to thoſe two Treaties; upon
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:62930:304"/>
Default whereof, there would be no Advance made therein.
And now it was given out at leaſt, and I believe there was
ſomething in it, that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> had
both declared to the French, That they ſhould be conſtrained
to declare War againſt them, without they went more ſeriouſly
on with the Buſineſs, and cut ſhort all unneceſſary Difficulties.
And here the Mediator repreſented to the French Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries,
as his laſt Advice, (becauſe he found them, as it were,
Deaf to the laſt Propoſal,) what he had ſaid to them before, in
relation to the Spaniards; and aſſured them, the others would
accept of ſuch a Project. But the French ſaid, That they had
given the Spaniards Time enough to deliberate: And for the
ſame Reaſon they required the ſame for themſelves. Upon
which, the Mediator reply'd, That their Courier was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
returned from <hi>Paris;</hi> and that, without him, they
had ſufficient Orders from their King, to treat: However,
ſome Days elapſed before they were brought to it. In the
Interim, the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi>'s Miniſter was very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
to have the French Ambaſſadors to get a full Power to
treat with him in particular, ſince his Maſter had formally
declared War againſt <hi>France.</hi> And the Deputies of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of <hi>Suabia</hi> and <hi>Franconia</hi> required, That Satisfaction
ſhould be made by <hi>France,</hi> to the ſaid Circles, for the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
they had ſuſtained during the War. But all this was
to little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>At length, on the 20th of <hi>July,</hi> the French gave in their Project of Peace, founded upon the fore-mentioned Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and <hi>Nimeguen:</hi> It would be too tedious to give
the Particulars of it in this place; but in ſhort, the main
of it, as to the Empire, was, An Offer to make void ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Spaniards, they offered to give up to them the City and County
of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> and the County of <hi>Chinay;</hi> or in lieu of them
ſome other Places hereafter to be named, for which there was
at preſent a Blank left in the Project: As to the Re-unions made,

               </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:62930:304"/>
The Spaniards ſeemed, in the main, to have been
pretty well ſatisfied with the French Conceſſions: But the
Emperor's Plenipotentiaries made a long, and, as ſome
thought, a ſome-what extravagant Anſwer to the Project;
which the others did not ſeem to regard ſo much, their
main Buſineſs being to make up with the reſt, upon what
Terms they were willing to give to them, and to ſave ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
if poſſible, of their great and long Acquiſitions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſince there was ſo little Proſpect of ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing
any thing elſewhere. Wherefore the French King finding
much Time ſpent to little purpoſe, by carrying on the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Writing; and not knowing what Accidents might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
he ordered his Plenipotentiaries to receive no Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
nor Anſwers from the Allies in Writing, but to treat
<hi>viva voce</hi> with them. And tho' the 10th of <hi>Sept.</hi> was the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Time the French would give, to accept of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers;
yet it was obſerved, that they began about this time
to demit ſome-what of their accuſtomed Rigour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aug.</hi> the 16th,<note place="margin">An Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs held.</note> was the firſt Day that an extraordinary Congreſs was held at <hi>Reſwick,</hi> which laſted almoſt the whole Day: And next Day the Plenipotentiaries of the Allies
were together for the firſt time, in the great Hall of the
Royal Palace. Not long after this, came the News of the
Taking of <hi>Barcelona</hi> by the French, after one of the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Sieges that had happen'd almoſt in any Age what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
This made the Spaniards very uneaſie, and very preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to have the Peace ſigned upon the Conditions offered by
<hi>France;</hi> and more eſpecially, ſince, by the Memorial given
in to the Mediator on the firſt Day of <hi>Sept.</hi> there had been
an Offer made of giving up this Place alſo to them, upon a
ſlight Conſideration of a few Villages belonging to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelline
of <hi>Aeth</hi> to be ſurrender'd to the French, for the
Conveniency of the Trade of the Inhabitants of <hi>Tournay.</hi>
But by how much the more eaſie the French ſeemed to be
with the Spaniards, they made ſo much the more bold with
the Empire, and now inſiſted poſitively upon the Detenſion
of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and that the Emperor ſhould reſt contented
with the Equivalent, which, they ſaid, would be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
to him, ſince he would have the entire Sovereignty
of thoſe Towns <hi>France</hi> quitted; whereas <hi>Strasburg,</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
muſt have been ſet at its own Liberty, as a Free
Imperial City. And if the Empire was ſtartled at this new
Pace, they were not a whit leſs at the Definite Time fixed
by <hi>France,</hi> for their Anſwer, which was the 20th of <hi>Sept.;</hi>
after which time they would be no longer obliged to thoſe
Offers. And this was ſtill the more mortifying, ſince they
began now to be ſuperiour in Force to the French there, and
to act Offenſively. And to this, that the Imperialiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:62930:305"/>
alſo by this time to be a a little Jealous, leſt ſome of
the Allies ſhould ſign a Separate Peace, and leave them out;
and this occaſioned ſome Heats between the Confederates,
which terminated in Conferences about the Subject Matter
lying before them.<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Portland</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof.</note> And tho' the Silence of the Allies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Treaty, did about this amaze the French Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries;
yet the Interview between my Lord <hi>Portland</hi>
and the Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> at the Requeſt of the latter,
occaſioned various Speculations, and was as a Dagger to
the Hearts of our <hi>Jacks</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who ſtill, poor Fools!
flattered themſelves, againſt all common Senſe and Reaſon,
that tho' a Treaty of Peace was held at the King's own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
yet he muſt be left out of it: And if this, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Interviews that were between thoſe two great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
of their Maſters, was ſo ſurprizing to moſt Men in
general, my Lord <hi>Portland,</hi> who went from thence, to the
<hi>Hague,</hi> his declaring, by the King's Order, to the Congreſs,
<hi>That as for what concerned His Majeſty and his Kingdoms, he

<hi>that his Concerns would occaſion no delay in the General Peace,
and therefore he earneſtly preſſed the other Allies, and particularly

to it by the Imperial Miniſters, he had deferred the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

towards him. I believe alſo the Spaniards perceived
that the Engliſh and Dutch could have ſaved <hi>Barcelona</hi> this
Year, if they had pleaſed; but that they rather declined it,
with an Intention to bring the Spaniards the more readily
to comply with the Offers of the French; and ſo much the
rather, ſince they ſaid upon this Occaſion (and that moſt
truly to) in their own Juſtification, That they had bore
alone the Burthen of the War, by keeping of great Fleets,
and numerous Land-Forces, which they had ſet out at their
own Charge, for the common Good; and, notwithſtanding
ſo many States and Princes of the Empire, they had paid,
almoſt alone, the Expences of the War all along the <hi>Rhine:</hi>
And that Trade not having its ordinary Courſe, all this
bore very hard upon them. To this may be added, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous

as he held and enjoyed them before he was diſpoſſeſſed

            <p>In purſuance of theſe Articles, the Governor marched out on the 6th of <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>Ponti</hi> entred in; who notwithſtanding the Agreement of having all the Silver, was in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity

how to come at it: Wherefore for an Expedient,
he ordered it to ſet up on the principal Gates, That he
would give the Tenth to the Proprietors, of whatſoever
they honeſtly brought him, and a Tenth to them that ſhould
inform him, of any Perſons that did not declare their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
to which he added his Threats of Puniſhment for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Diſobedience, which had the deſired effect upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of the People; neither were the Churches and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Houſes ſpared, though the Monſieur is pleaſed to
ſoften that part with ſaying, <hi>They gathered only what was for

for all their Ships to ſteer Weſt directly before the Wind,
at what time there were but three of the Engliſh that kept
within ſight of them, and them at a great diſtance, ſo that
next day they got clear off of them.</p>
            <p>From hence the French, having made ſo narrow an Eſcape, not without ſome diſhonour to our Commanders, for want of better Management, ſailed for <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> and put
in for Water (whereof they had not above what would have

ſuppoſing the French (now mightily weakned with Sickneſs)
to be much ſtronger than they were, declined putting out
to Fight them; and ſo they eſcaped a ſcouring a ſecond time,

ſix Engliſh Men of War that attacked them, is more they
owned, than themſelves could have expected in the pittiful

                        </p>

in the Condition they were at what time they were poſſeſs'd
by his Majeſty's Arms.</p>
                        <p>XXXII. His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty having teſtify'd his Deſire, That the Iſland of <hi>Ponza,</hi> in the Mediterranean Sea, ſhall be reſtor'd to Monſieur the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

Yet before advice could come hereof to Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi>
he had taken the Caſtle of <hi>Eberemburg,</hi> and was going to lay

            <p>The Imperialis, is true, miſcarried in the firſt Deſign they had concerted to begin the Campaign with the taking of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatz,</hi>
the more than ordinary Oppoſition they met with there,
and the Rebellion that brake forth in <hi>Vpper Hungary,</hi> which
was calculated to have begun about the time of the Election of
<hi>Poland,</hi> having occaſioned them to draw their Troops that
way: But though the Head of this laſt <hi>Hydra</hi> was quickly cut
off, yet the <hi>Turks,</hi> headed again by the Grand Seignior in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſeemed to come very formidable into the Field, and
threatned to give new Life to this Monſter again, or to puſh
quite through <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and thereby entirely deſpoil the
Emperor of the Benefit of that Principality; Though other
Aſpects of the Enemies Motion gave the <hi>Germans</hi> Umbrage,
that they deſigned to attack <hi>Peter Waradin.</hi> But while Prince
<hi>Eugenius</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who commanded the Imperial Army, lay
at <hi>Belſche,</hi> he received, upon the 12th of <hi>Sept.</hi> the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Intelligence that he had had before, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
had a Deſign to march directly to <hi>Segedin,</hi> with this
Addition, That ſeveral Parties of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> were ſent
out to burn and plunder the Country. A Captain of <hi>Zenta</hi>
alſo, <hi>Tokeli</hi> by Name, reported, That about Noon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was at <hi>Zenta,</hi> and that they had detached a Body of Horſe,
in order to deſtroy all before them. For the better Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Truth of which, two Parties of 60 Horſes apiece
were ſent upon the Scout: In the mean time the Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
before Day, and marched in 12 Columns, Six of
Horſe, and Six of Foot, the Artillery in the middle; in which
Order they continued their March till 9 in the Afternoon;
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:62930:320"/>
in which time ſome of the Parties ſent to get Intelligence,
brought word, That they met the Enemies Guards near <hi>Zen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi>
Hereupon the <hi>Huſſars</hi> were immediately ſent away to
ſuccour and bring them off; who, having performed their
Orders, took a Baſſa Priſoner, and returned without the Loſs
of one Man. The Baſſa was examined, and threatned to have
his Head cut off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he did not tell the Truth: He told them.
That the Grand Seignior had a real Deſign to march direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Segedin,</hi> and to try if he could make himſelf Maſter
of it in his March, becauſe he was aſſured by <hi>Tekely</hi> and the
<hi>Coruſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> That it might be eaſily taken before the Imperial
Army could overtake them; and withal, That the City was
defenceleſs. But underſtanding that the Imperialiſts, who
were decamped from <hi>Peter Waradin,</hi> followed them cloſe at
the Heels, and that there was a numerous Garriſon in <hi>Segedin,</hi>
he had ſtopt at <hi>Zenta,</hi> and had laid a Bridge over the <hi>Theyſſe,</hi>
which they had brought in Waggons, and which had been
built at <hi>Belgrade</hi> laſt Winter by the Direction of a <hi>Frenchman,</hi>
being a neat, good, commodious Invention; That now the
Grand Seignior had a Deſign to march into <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> and
<hi>Vpper Hungary,</hi> to which purpoſe he had already paſſed the
<hi>Theyſſe</hi> in Perſon with ſome Thouſands of Horſe; That the laſt
Night, when this Baſſa was ſent upon the Scout, the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and heavy Baggage began to paſs the ſame River, but that
the reſt of the Army was ſtill on the other ſide, with above
an Hundred Pieces of Cannon; nor could he tell whether
thoſe Troops would paſs the River or no; That in the mean
time the <hi>Turks</hi> were already intre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ched, and that they had
begun to caſt another Intrenchment at the Head of the Bridge.
The Baſſa added, That the <hi>Tartars, Coruſſes,</hi> and ſome <hi>Turks,</hi>
burnt all the Country before them; though, as he ſaid, they
had received no ſuch Orders from the Sultan, which was not
eaſie to be believed. Upon this Information the Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
their March, receiving Advice every Moment by the
<hi>Huſſars</hi> and Spies, That the Enemy was ſtill croſſing the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and that their Cavalry were ſtirred out of their Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
according to Cuſtom, to skirmiſh with the Chriſtians.
Two Hours after other Priſoners gave an Account, That the
greateſt part of the Horſe were already on the other ſide of
the River, and the reſt were haſting to paſs it. All this
while the Imperialiſts could not imagine that the Infantry
could ſtay alone on this ſide the River, becauſe that the
Night before they had done no more than only begun to
make a ſecond Retrenchment, according to the Report of the
Baſſa and other Priſoners. This obliged Prince <hi>Eugenius</hi> to
advance with the Cavalry, and ſome Artillery, within an Hours
March of <hi>Zenta,</hi> receiving divers Confirmations in his March
of what had been reported. The Prince, being come to the
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:62930:320"/>
Place before-mentioned, ſtaid there for the Foot, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arrived, he drew up the Army in Battle-Array; the
Right Wing was ſecured by the <hi>Theyſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Zenta.</hi>
               </note> the Left was extended
as far as the Men could take up any Ground, the Left Flank
was reinforced with a Second Line. In this Order he made a
Halt till 3 of the Clock, and half an hour paſt; at what time
the Army marched in Battle-Array. Being come near <hi>Zenta,</hi>
they could perceive but Two Thouſand of the Enemies Horſe.
The Van Courriers alſo reported, That they viewed the
Turks Bridge, over which Troops were continually paſſing,
inſomuch that there was a great deal of Confuſion upon
the Bridge. Upon which Prince <hi>Eugenius</hi> took three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Dragoons out of both the Wings, and two more
out of the ſecond Line of the Flank, with ſome Pieces of
Cannon, and putting himſelf at the Head of that Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
advanced towards the Enemy with all the Speed he
could, giving Order for the reſt of the Army to follow him
in order of Battle. All this while the Enemy's Horſe made
over the Bridge as faſt as they could; ſo that the Prince
could eaſily perceive the Confuſion that was upon the Bridge,
there being a World of Baggage ſtill on this ſide. Being
thus advanced within Cannon-ſhot of the Enemy's Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Turks began to play upon the Imperialiſts with
their great Guns, which the Chriſtians anſwered, while the
Army ſtill advanced, and the ſix Regiments which had been
detached were ordered to their Stations in the Army. In
this Order the Army advanced within half Cannon-ſhot of
the Enemy's Entrenchments, there remaining no more than
two Hours of Day-light. The Right Wing was then as it
were lin'd by the River, together with ſome Regiments of the
Flank of the Left; at what time they perceiv'd the Enemy's
Horſe were endeavouring to ſlide between them and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and ſo fall upon that Wing; but they found that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible:
In the mean time they planted ſome Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
upon that Wing, with which they plaid continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Bridge; and the ſame Order was obſerved in the
Right Wing, and immediately after the Fight began on
every ſide. I have already told you, that the Turkiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
endeavour'd to ſlip between the River and the Left
Wing, which the Imperialiſts perceiving, and obſerving that
there was a Space of Ground between 30 and 40 Paces broad
between the Enemy and the River, from whence they might
fall upon the Enemy's Rear, they planted ſome Cannon
there with all ſpeed, and ordered the Enemy to be attack'd
by the Infantry of the Flank and the Left Wing, ſome time
before the main Body and the Foot of the Right Wing could
do it. This ſucceeded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, notwithſtanding the thick
Fire of the Enemy with their great Guns laden with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touches,
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:62930:321"/>
and the continual Vollies of their Small-ſhot; ſo
that the Infantry of the Left Wing broke in upon them;
and then the Army, as well Horſe as Foot, fell on at the
ſame Inſtant that the Enemy was already in ſome Diſorder
by reaſon of thoſe who had already fallen upon their Backs,
There were two Entrenchments, one behind another, beſides
a Barricado of Waggons; and they were ſo good, that it is
not eaſie to apprehend how the Foot could force them. The
Victors paſſed them both in half an Hours time, during
which there was nothing but Fire and Smoak on both ſides.
The Horſe alſo advanced at the ſame time with the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to the Moat of the Entrenchment, where they ſtood the
Enemy's Fire, and charged in the ſame manner as the Foot,
which perhaps was hardly ever ſeen before. So ſoon as the
Infantry of the Left Wing had broken into the Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all the Army acted together with equal Force; nor
was it poſſible to reſtrain the Soldiers. One part of the
Cavalry alighted from their Horſes, and paſſed the Moat over
the ſlain Enemy. In the mean time the Germans of the Left
Wing and Flank, cut off the Turks way to the Bridge, whence
followed a moſt horrible Slaughter, as well within the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments,
as upon the Bridge, and in the River, into
which they threw themſelves to eſcape the Imperialiſts: For
the Soldiers were ſo eager after Blood, that they gave
Quarter to no Body, neither Baſſa's nor Officers, tho' they
promiſed large Ranſoms. Hence it came to paſs, that ſo
few Priſoners were taken, and thoſe only ſuch as were found
among the Slain, or in the Barks that compoſed the Bridge:
By thoſe it was underſtood, that all the Turkiſh Infantry
was in the Fight, there being not any on the other ſide of
the River, but about 2000 Men for the Grand Seignior's
Guard. Whence it may be concluded, That the Foot were
all deſtroy'd, and that ſeveral Thouſands were ſlain. The
Fight ended with the Day; nor can we ſufficiently ſet forth
the Valour and Courage of the Generals, the Officers and
Soldiers, from the higheſt to the loweſt; but principally
the Skill and Dexterity of Prince <hi>Eugenius</hi> is to be extolled,
who, tho' much inferiour to the Enemy, knew ſo well how
to watch his Opportunity, that he made himſelf equal to
him in ſome ſort, by falling upon him at a time, that but
one part of his Army could fight, the other being on the
other ſide of the River, and not able to ſuccour thoſe that
were diſtreſs'd. All the Imperialiſts retreated out of the
Trenches, after two Hours within Night, and ſpent the reſt
of it as well as they could. However, it were ſo order'd,
that the greateſt Number was poſted along the <hi>Theyſſe;</hi> but
it was impoſſible to rally them all again under their proper
Colours. Some were appointed to Guard the Bridge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:62930:321"/>
which was ſet an advanced Guard. The next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the 12th, a Camp was marked out for the Army, and
it was found that the Action was much more advantageous
than it was thought, as well for the Number of the Slain,
as the Number of great Guns, the vaſt quantities of Bombs,
Carcaſſes, Granadoes, Ammunition and Proviſion, beſides
great and ſmall Cattle, by reaſon of the Enemy's Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the River, which was half a League wide, and which
the Turks had quitted. The Fugitives reported, That the
Grand Seignior fled in great Conſternation to <hi>Temeſwaer.</hi>
In their Camp were found all their Tents, with that of the
Grand Seignior's himſelf, ſeveral Camels, and other Beaſts,
heavy Artillery, Bombs, Carcaſſes, and other Ammunition,
beſides a prodigious quantity of Proviſion, and about 6000
Waggons, on both ſides the River; and ſome Men were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
to go and make themſelves Maſters of this Booty.
But as it uſually happens in ſuch Hurries, the Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
took Fire that Day beyond the Bridge, as it had done
the Night before on this ſide the Bridge; ſo that a good
part of it was conſumed, with a great quantity of Victuals,
and other Booty. In the Morning a <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
brought the Grand Seignior's Seal, a curious Piece of
Workmanſhip; which never happened before, in any Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
that had been fought during this War. Which confirm'd
what the Priſoners and Fugitives reported, That the Grand
Viſier was kill'd; becauſe he is bound always to carry the
Seal about his Neck. In the mean time the <hi>Huſſars,</hi> and
ſome other Troops of the Army, purſued the Enemy for
above 4 or 5 Leagues together from the Place where the
Battle was fought, who found ſtore of Booty by the way,
and ſome lazy Turks, whom they took Priſoners. The
ſame day Colonel <hi>Gleckelsberg</hi> was ſent out in purſuit of the
Infidels with 600 Horſe, and to pick up what Booty and
Priſoners he could. He purſued the flying Enemy as far as
<hi>Aranga,</hi> within half a Mile of <hi>Temeſwaer;</hi> and after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
with a conſiderable Booty which he met with all along
the Road, he confirm'd what had been reported of the
Grand Seignior's Conſternation, and of the ſmall number of
Foot that was left him. As for the Loſs which the Turks
ſuſtained, it augmented every day by new Relations; the
laſt of which gave an Account, That beſides the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
and the Aga of the Janiſaries, there were 27 Baſſa's ſlain
upon the Spot, above 20000 Men killed, and about 10 or
12000 drowned in the <hi>Theyſſe,</hi> 6000 wounded, and ſeveral
taken Priſoners. The Booty conſiſted of 6000 Waggons la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Ammunition and Proviſion, 6000 Camels, 6000
Horſes, 12000 Oxen, and a very great number of other
Spoils, with 160 Pieces of Cannon, among which there were
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:62930:322"/>
70 of a larger Size for Artillery, 500 Drums, and as many
Colours, 74 Pair of Kettle-Drums, the Grand Seignior's
Tent, valued at about 4000 Florins, and a Coach, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
with Six Horſes, wherein were 10 Women of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
Seraglio: It was ſaid, that the whole Booty amounted to
ſeveral Millions. This Victory was ſo much the more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
becauſe it was gained with ſo little Loſs to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts.
A loſs ſo ſmall, that it is a rare thing to read of ſo
great a Battle fought, and wun, with ſo little Effuſion of
Blood on the Victors Side, ſome Regiments not looſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
1, 2, or 3, others not above 14, 15, or 29, at moſt.
But how Glorious ſoever this Action was, there was this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
that did attend it, that it was ſo late in the Year,
that the Germans could go upon no conſiderable Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and follow the Blow: So that all they did the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Campaign, was to make an Incurſion into <hi>Boſnia,</hi>
from whence they returned with a conſiderable Booty. So
we ſhall leave them, and being ſo near, will take a ſtep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Poland,</hi> and ſee how their Affairs ſtood there, before we
return to proſecute the remaining Negotiations of the
Peace. We have hinted before, that the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi>
was choſen King of <hi>Poland,</hi> as much contrary to moſt Men's
Expectations, as the Change of his Religion was thereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And that for all this, the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> his Competitor's
Expedition thither (who was in like manner proclaimed
King) was at length undertaken: However, <hi>Saxony</hi> was
by much before-hand with him; for beſides other Paces
made, the Baron <hi>de Fleming,</hi> as early as <hi>July</hi> 13th, in his
Maſter's Name, ſigned the <hi>Pacta Conventa;</hi> the ſame being
done alſo by a great Number of the Senators and Principal
of the Nobility. The Articles were theſe,</p>

            <p>IX. The Revenues in Money ſhall not be employ'd to the particular Benefit of the King; nor ſhall any Money be Coin'd without the Conſent of the Republick.</p>
            <p>X. No Foreign Forces ſhall be brought into the Kingdom, without the knowledge of the Republick.</p>
            <p>XI. None ſhall be employ'd in Embaſſies, but Gentlemen of good Fortunes.</p>
            <p>XII. No body ſhall purchaſe the Right of Naturalization, but ſuch as have done the Republick important Services.</p>
            <p>XIII. No body ſhall be admitted to any Preferment in the Royal Houſhold, unleſs he have firſt ſerv'd the Crown.</p>
            <p>XIV. Nor ſhall any Perſon by the Connivance of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, enjoy any petty Revenues of the Crown, without the Conſent of the Republick.</p>
            <p>XV. No Perſon ſhall enjoy two conſiderable Offices at one time, ſuch as are thoſe of the Mareſchal and General; but they who now enjoy any Offices, ſhall continue in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of 'em, and enjoy the Revenues of 'em without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falcation.</p>
            <p>XVI. The accuſtom'd Order in the Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhall be preſerv'd without any alteration.</p>
            <p>XVII. The King, when he has re-taken <hi>Caminiec,</hi> ſhall cauſe it to be fortify'd at his own Charges; but after that, the Republick ſhall keep the ſaid Fortifications in Repair.</p>

            <p>XX. Only the Latin and Poliſh Languages ſhall be made uſe of for the King's Letters and Orders.</p>
            <p>XXI. The Laws, call'd <hi>Pacta Henricea,</hi> ſhall be obſerv'd in the Judgments call'd <hi>Poſtcurialia;</hi> and when any Difficulty ſhall ariſe, Judgment ſhall be given with the Counſellors
Aſſeſſors.</p>
            <p>XXII. The Differences which are in the—ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd with all ſpeed that may be.</p>
            <p>XXIII. That no new Cuſtom or Novelty ſhall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Order of the King's Table, but that the ancient Cuſtom ſhall be exactly obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>XXIV. Places becoming vacant in the Intervals of Dyets, ſhall be ſupply'd in ſix Weeks.</p>
            <p>

            <p>XXX. All the Privileges which belong to the Univerſities of <hi>Cracow,</hi> and other Cities, as well Eccleſiaſtick as Secular, as alſo all the Articles which were promis'd upon Oath at
the Coronations of the Kings, <hi>Henry, Stephen, Sigiſmond
Vladiſtaus, John Caſimir,</hi> and others, ſhall be renew'd at this
Election; which if it be not done, or any thing endeavour'd
to the contrary of theſe Articles, then the Inhabitants of
<hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> to be free and diſingag'd from their
Obedience.</p>
            <p>This being over, the new King advanced towards <hi>Poland,</hi>
and upon the Frontiers was harangued by the Embaſſy ſent
to him by the Republick, or at leaſt a Party of it; And
having himſelf Swore to the <hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> and given ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Teſtimony of his being reconciled to the Romiſh
Church, he deliver'd himſelf to the Nobility that attended
him in the following manner:</p>
            <q>MY Dear and Good Friends, You have choſen Me to be
Your King, You are come to offer Me the Crown, and
You have brought Me hither. I am come, and have quitted my
Territories and my Country, for Love of You. 'Tis not with a
Deſign to be a Burthen to You, but to bring abundance along with
Me, my Wealth, my Forces, and all that belongs to Me, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as much as in Me lies, the Glory and Honour of Your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by fighting againſt the Enemies of the Kingdom, more-eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially

always conſtant and ſincere towards my Faithful Subjects, and
that my Sword ſhall only be employ'd in the Defence of Your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and the Authority with which You have inveſted Me.</q>
            <p>From <hi>Piccari,</hi> the King continued his March towards <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow;</hi>
And tho', all Circumſtances conſider'd, he had by

for theſe Reaſons, and becauſe of our Change, the States
of our ſaid Country, and our Dear Subjects may believe
that we have a Deſign to aboliſh their ancient Priviledges,
we have thought fit to declare, That we have not any the
leaſt Thought to over-charge 'em in any manner whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
contrary to their aforeſaid ancient Priviledges, but
rather graciouſly to maintain our ſaid States and Subjects
in all their Liberties; aſſuring 'em, that as we promis'd
'em, when we enter'd into Poſſeſſion of our Eſtates, and
were ſettl'd in the Government, and now that we have
embrac'd the Roman Religion, that we will maintain and
protect our Dear States and Subjects in their <hi>Ausburg</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
in their ancient Poſſeſſion of Liberty of Conſcience,
of Churches, of Religious Worſhip, of Religious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
of Univerſities, of Schools, and of all other Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
which they now enjoy; that in purſuance of this,
we will not conſtrain any Perſon to embrace our preſent
Catholick Religion, but will leave every Body free in his
own Conſcience, as we aſſure 'em upon our Royal and
Electoral Word; aſſuring our ſelves in the mean time
that our Dear States and Subjects, will continue their juſt
Affection, Love, Eſteem, and Fidelity, which they have
hitherto teſtify'd to our Perſon, as their Lawful Elector
and Sovereign, and that they will live in Peace, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and in Union during our Abſence for a while; ſo
that the Bleſſing of God, and all manner of Happineſs may
more and more increaſe, to which purpoſe we will aſſiſt
our People with all our Power, and at all times give 'em
Demonſtrations of our Royal and Electoral Affection. And
to the end that our preſent Aſſurance and Promiſe may
be known to all our States and Subjects of our Electorate
and other Countries, we ordain, that being Printed, it be
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:62930:324"/>
affix'd in all Places of our Electorate and Country, and
that Copies of it be every where diſtributed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd.
And for the greater Confirmation of what is above
written, we have Sign'd this preſent Act and Promiſe
with our Hand, and Seal'd it with our Seal.</q>

            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> in the mean time being buoy'd up by the Primate and his Party, <hi>September</hi> the 6th left <hi>France,</hi>
and on the 25th arrived before <hi>Danzick;</hi> but while that
City refuſed his Men the liberty of Landing, and adher'd
firmly to the Intereſt of the Elector, this laſt was ſolemnly
crowned King at <hi>Cracow, September</hi> 15. This undoubtedly
muſt be a great Mortification to the Prince of <hi>Conti;</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
not to be totally diſcouraged, and in aſſurance that
the Lithuanian Army would not ſubmit to the new crown'd
King, with an Intention farther ſtill to embroil Matters,
he wrote the following Letter, and his Party were very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous

            <p>But tho' this Stratagem had not the deſired Effect, the new King did not defer the March of ſome of his Troops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <pb n="641" facs="tcp:62930:324"/>
               <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> where General <hi>Brandt</hi> was no ſooner arrived,

to <hi>Oliva</hi> with about 2000 Horſe, he there ſurprized a
Party of the Prince's, ſome of whom he put to the Sword,
while of the reſt he made an 100 Priſoners: The French
Embaſſador, <hi>Polignac,</hi> narrowly eſcaped on Board <hi>du Bart</hi>'s

been taken himſelf, had General <hi>Brandt</hi> deferred his march
but two Hours longer, inſomuch that finding himſelf now
quite diſappointed of his Hopes, he ſail'd away on the 9th
for <hi>France.</hi> But before his departure, we wrote two Letters,
one to the Primate, wherein he acknowledged his wondrous
Affection to his Intereſts, profeſſed his great Concern for <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's</hi>
being ſubjected to Foreign Force, and of his being not
able to ſuccour them, and that the Revolt of the <hi>Lithuanian</hi>
Army, at the Head of which he deſign'd to have put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
with the Rigour of the Seaſon, conſtrained his Return,
he not having found one ſingle Place in all <hi>Poland,</hi> that was
willing to hold out for him. The other Letter was to the
Republick, being full of Complaints, they ſhould ſo fail of
their Words to him, affront him in the Face of all <hi>Europe,</hi>
to make him go ſo far to ſo ill Purpoſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with aſſuring them, That if they ſtood in need of

            <p>
               <hi>Conti</hi> being thus gone, <hi>Saxony</hi> is left at full liberty to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the remainder of his Game without Foreign Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; But he found it ſtill enough, and too much, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with the Obſtinacy of the Primate and other Factions,
both in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and no leſs than the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another Year has enabled him to put a final Period
to it: But of this in its proper Place, it's time now we
ſhould return to the remaining Negotiations of the Peace
at <hi>Ryſwick.</hi> Yet firſt, we are to obſerve, that about the
time of the Signing of the foremention'd Truce, between
the Empire, and <hi>France,</hi> ſeveral Embaſſadors of the Allies,
Princes, and States of the Empire, waited upon our King
at <hi>Loo,</hi> where, notwithſtanding the Concluſion of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Treaties, an offenſive, and defenſive Alliance was whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
to have been entred into, or rather renewed between
the Allies; Where it was alſo Conſulted, what manner of
good Precautions ought to be uſed, to prevent the Violation
of the Peace, now concluded, and how in caſe of Neceſſity
every State ſhould furniſh ſuch a Proportion of Men, and
Money. And the Embaſſadors of the Empire happening to
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:62930:325"/>
Complain again, how much they were oppreſſed by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature
Treaty, they were anſwered, That they ought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it to themſelves, as being adviſed to put in their
Complaints without delay. Beſides, that it had been ſaid
before them more than once, that it was the Intereſt of the
Empire to Retard the Treaties no longer; that they ſhould
not flatter themſelves, that more favourable or advantagious
Conditions could have been got thereby, ſince the French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
ſtill upon the firſt, of which, they would retract no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
that by conſequence they ought to ſuffer, and not to
blame; that which could not be done over again. So the
Imperialiſts ſeeing it was in vain to Complain, had there
been any juſt room for it, applied themſelves to Adjuſt the
remaining Points in Controverſie with <hi>France,</hi> and the
greateſt difference ſeemed to be about <hi>Strasburg.</hi> It was

The Imperialiſts hereupon would tye the French
to the Performance of the Promiſe made by them in the
Preliminaries, and which they had ſo often repeated after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
and therefore it was not without reaſon that they
maintained, that all that was odious, ariſing from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
of the Treaty, ought to light upon the French, and
not upon the Imperialiſts, nor the Allies: But the French
were poſitive in their laſt Propoſals, as well as to the time
they had limitted for the accepting of them; ſo that there
was yet but little appearance of bringing things to a Final
Accommodation. The Proteſtant Princes of the Empire
ſhewed alſo the Zeal they had for the Intereſt of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and therefore being met together at the Houſe of the
Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi>'s Embaſſador, they Named four Deputies,

Cities of <hi>Aiſatia,</hi> which belonged to the French King, by
vertue of former Treaties, the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion ſhould be
Tollerated, and enjoy all thoſe Rights and Immunities it had

Days to anſwer. But what miſintelligence ſoever there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
might appear to continue between them, and the Imperial
Plenipotentiaries as to other Points; it plainly appeared they
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:62930:325"/>
agreed well enough, or rather Combined together to have
the Popiſh Religion Exerciſed in the ſame ſtate it was now
in the reſpective Places that were to be delivered up, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any notice taken of the Reformed at all, which made
the Miniſters of the Proteſtant Princes decline to Sign the

ought to be look'd upon as the Baſis and Foundation of this

after what manner they ought to Act. And for as

                        </p>
                        <p>IV. Moreover that Clauſe is contrary to the particular Inſtruction which the Deputies of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg</hi>

                        <p>VIII. To the Project, and Declaration which their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, the Embaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> deliver'd the 20th of <hi>July,</hi>

                           <hi>IX. That Clauſe is alſo oppoſite to the preceding Article of the Peace of</hi> Ryſwick, <hi>according to which the Treaties of</hi>

be duly put in Execution, in reſpect of Spiritual and Temporal,
and ſhall be inviolably obſerv'd for the future. <hi>For as to the
Clauſe which is added,</hi> if it ſhall not be expreſly derogated from

underſtood of the Temporal, and not of the Spiritual, as
may be manifeſtly inferr'd from the Paſſage already cited,
and by many others of the</hi> Weſtphalian <hi>Treaty. For it was

9. <hi>of the Treaty of the Peace of</hi> Oſnabrug, That they
of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg</hi> ſhould not be moleſted for the time

of the Church which they enjoy'd; but that they ſhould be
for ever ſecure from all Proſecutions of Law and Violence, till the
Conteſts about Religion ſhould be determin'd.</p>
                        <p>X. This Clauſe that has been already ſeveral times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, is alſo contrary to the Separate Articles of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties paſt with the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the United Provinces; by which His Sacred Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Majeſty, and the Empire, were left at liberty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
or not conclude the Peace, by a time prefix'd in the
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:62930:326"/>
Conditions, which had been ſtipulated in the Project and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XI. Moreover ſuch a Clauſe gives too great a Shog to the Union and Tye of Concord that reigns in all the States of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>XII. And ſince his Imperial Majeſty's Embaſſie has refus'd to take notice of the General Remonſtrance of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, concerning the Execution only of the III. Article of the
Peace, becauſe the ſaid Execution in the Empire no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<hi>France,</hi> but only the Emperor and the Empire;</p>
                        <p>XIII. Seeing alſo, that the Embaſſie of his Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty has not only refus'd to take any Cognizance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Remonſtrances of ſome of the Evangelicks, by which
they deſire to provide for the Re-eſtabliſhment of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
in the Provinces which are to be reſtor'd to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire, looking upon thoſe Remonſtrances as ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ſeeing they no way concern'd the Moſt Chriſtian King,
and as being already compriz'd under the Regulation of the
III Article: Beſides, that they rejected a General Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance
of the Evangelicks, for the Preſervation of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick
Religion, in the Cities of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> and <hi>Alſatia,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stipulations of the Peace of <hi>Weſtphalia;</hi> there is no
reaſon that the Embaſſie of <hi>France</hi> ſhould pretend the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
of this Clauſe, or that the Emperor's Embaſſie
ſhould admit it, and make an Alteration ſo contrary to the
ſaid Peace, in the Territories of the Empire, in reference to
Eccleſiaſtical Affairs.</p>
                        <p>XIV. The ſaid Embaſſadors and Plenipotentiaries here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, cannot give their Conſent to the Clauſe ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, contrary to their Orders and their Conſciences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing ſome notable Prejudice both to their Maſters, and
all the reſt who uphold the Peace of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and who are
oblig'd to defend it; more-eſpecially perceiving, upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Treaty of <hi>Ryſwick</hi> after it was ſign'd, that certain
Things were inſerted not only in this Article, but in ſeveral
other Places, without their Knowledge; and at the ſame time
omitted other things, which do not ſlightly concern the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicks,
and of which Report will be made to the States of the
Empire.</p>
                        <p>XV. And tho' it was propos'd by way of Expedient, that the Evangelicks ſhould ſign the Treaty of Peace, in hopes the Affair would be accommodated, there were but Three who
did it, having particular Reaſons for ſo doing; the reſt of the
Embaſſadors and Plenipotentiaries refuſing their Conſent, as
already has been ſaid, becauſe their Inſtructions expreſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
'em the contrary, the Diſpute being abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t a Change
of State, in regard of Eccleſiaſtick Affairs, within the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of the Empire. And they thought they might the
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:62930:327"/>
better do it, becauſe the Embaſſies of <hi>France</hi> had very often
excus'd themſelves, during the courſe of the Negotiation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                        <p>XVI. Thus after mature Deliberation, another Expedient was propounded; which was to defer ſigning the Treaty, till our Sovereigns ſhould be inform'd of all things, and ſhould

Welfare of Chriſtendom, upon Conditions of Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
the Tenor whereof is as followeth.</p>
                        <p>I. THere ſhall be a Chriſtian, Univerſal, Perpetual Peace, and a true Amity between his Sacred Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and his Succeſſors, the whole Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and
the Kingdoms and Hereditary States, their Vaſſals and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
on the one part; It ſhall be faithfully and ſincerely
maintain'd, ſo that the one ſhall not undertake any thing
under what Pretence ſoever, to the Ruin or Prejudice of the
other, nor Afford, or Lend Aſſiſtance upon any account what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
to any one who would attempt it, or in any wiſe do
any Wrong to the other; that he will not receive, protect,
or aſſiſt in any way or manner whatſoever, the Rebellious and
Diſobedient Subjects of the other Party; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
both Parties ſhall ſeriouſly procure the Benefit, Honour,
and mutual Advantage of each other, notwithſtanding all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
Treaties and Alliances to the contrary made, or to be
made in any manner whatſoever, which are aboliſhed, and
made of none effect by the preſent Treaty.</p>
                        <p>II. There ſhall be on both ſides an Amneſty and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Oblivion of all the Hoſtilities reciprocally committed, in what place or manner ſoever it be; ſo that upon any Cauſe
or Pretence of the ſame, or upon any other account, it may
not be lawful for the one to expreſs any Reſentment to the
other, nor create any Trouble or Vexation, directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,
either by way of Juſtice, or <hi>de facto,</hi> in any place
whaſoever, nor permit that any ſuch ſhall be expreſſed or
created; but all and ſingular the Injuries and Violences whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Word, Deed, or Writing, without any reſpect to
Perſons or Things, are ſo intirely and fully aboliſh'd and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd,
that whatſoever the one may pretend againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon this account, ſhall be bury'd in everlaſting Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion;
all and ſeveral the Subjects and Vaſſals of both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſhall enjoy the Effect and Benefit of the preſent Amneſty,
inſomuch that the having adhered to ſuch or ſuch a Party,
ſhall not be wreſted to the Prejudice or Diſadvantage of any
of them; but that he ſhall be wholly re-eſtabliſh'd and ſettled,
as to his Honours and Eſtate, in the ſame condition he was
in immediately before the War, excepting notwithſtanding
what hath been more eſpecially and particularly regulated in
the following Articles, in relation to Moveables, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Benefices and Revenues.</p>
                        <p>III. The Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and <hi>Nimeguen</hi> ſhall be look'd upon as the Baſis and Foundation of this preſent Treaty, and conſequently in purſuance of the ſame, immediately upon the
Exchange of the Ratifications, the ſaid Treaties ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                        <p>IV. Particularly there ſhall be deliver'd up to his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſty, to the Empire, and to its States and Members, all the Places and Rights ſituate out of <hi>Alſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

have been expreſt in the Catalogue of Reunions produced by
the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> nulling to this purpoſe all the
Decrees, Determinations, Acts and Declarations made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account by the Chambers of <hi>Metz</hi> and <hi>Beſancon,</hi> and
by the Council of <hi>Briſac:</hi> and all things ſhall be reduced to
the ſame Condition wherein they were before the foreſaid
Seiſures, Unions, or Reunions, without putting the Poſſeſſors
of the ſaid Places to any further Trouble or Moleſtation, the
Roman Catholick Religion nevertheleſs remaining ſettled
in the fore-mentioned places, in the ſame manner as it is at
preſent.</p>
                        <p>V. And albeit by theſe general Rules one may eaſily judge who they be that are to be re-eſtabliſhed, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and how far they ought to be ſo; nevertheleſs upon the
earneſt Sollicitations of ſome, and for ſome particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
it hath been thought convenient to make particular
mention of ſome Occaſions; yet ſo, that thoſe who ſhall not
be expreſly named, may not be taken for omitted, but ſhall

and may be put in the ſame Rank and Capacity.</p>
                        <p>VI. Namely, the Elector of <hi>Triers,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Spires,</hi>
ſhall be re-inveſted in the Poſſeſſion of the City of <hi>Triers</hi> or

which was agreed upon as to the City of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> muſt
be conſidered as repeated in this place word for word.</p>
                        <p>XXI. The foreſaid Places, Cities, Caſtles, and Fortreſſes, together with all their Juriſdictions, Appurtenances, and Dependences made over and deliver'd to his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,

or have made it appear to the French Intendants,

inſomuch that the ſaid Cities, Cittadels, Forts and Places,

and all other things whatſoever contained therein,
may return to be under the Juriſdiction, actual Poſſeſſion,

have been hitherto poſſeſt by <hi>His Most Chriſtian Majeſty;</hi> the
Crown of <hi>France</hi> not retaining or reſerving to it ſelf any
Right, Claim, or Pretenſion to the fore-mention'd Places
and their Juriſdiction. Neither ſhall they demand the Coſt

be put off and deferred, for any Reaſon whatſoever,

thereto, that are on the right Hand of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and all

of which the fourth Article of the Treaty of Peace
at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> is to be look'd upon as repeatable in this place
in expreſs Terms. But the Fort that was built on the Left

Chriſtian King's Order after the taking of it, ſhall be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demoliſhed.</p>
                        <p>XXIII. The Moſt Chriſtian King ſhall take care to cauſe the Fortifications built over againſt <hi>Hunningen</hi> upon the Right ſide in the Iſle of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to be razed at his own proper Coſt

part of the Bridge that goes from the ſaid Bridge to the
Iſle, which ſhall never be repaired hereafter by either
Party.</p>
                        <p>XXV. The Moſt Chriſtian King ſhall likewiſe cauſe to be demoliſh'd the Fortifications added after the Peace of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen,</hi>
to the Caſtle of <hi>Trarbach,</hi> and the Fortreſs of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royal</hi>
upon the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> without any Body's preſuming to
repair them for the future, yet leaving the Fortreſs of <hi>Trar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach</hi>
intire to be wholly reſtored, with the City and its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances
to its former Poſſeſſors.</p>
                        <p>XXVI. They ſhall likewiſe demoliſh the Fortifications ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Moſt Chriſtian King, to the Fortreſs of <hi>Kern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
after which demoliſhing, the City of <hi>Kernburg</hi> being
left intire and untouched, as alſo the other Goods and
Chattels belonging to the Prince of <hi>Salm,</hi> and to his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins
the <hi>Rhinegraves,</hi> and <hi>Vildgraves,</hi> and other things, ſhall
be reſtored to be poſſeſſed in the ſame manner, and with
the very ſame Right they did poſſeſs them before they were
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:62930:333"/>
turn'd out of them. Upon which it is agreed and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to by the preſent Treaty.</p>
                        <p>XXVII. The New Fortifications added by the Moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, to the Fortreſs of <hi>Ebernburg,</hi> ſhall alſo be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, and the Fortreſs to be afterwards reſtored to
the Barons of <hi>Sickenguen,</hi> with other Eſtates belonging to
them, which are to be reſtored to them by both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p>XXVIII. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having been united to his Imperial Majeſty in this War, and having a deſire to be comprehended within this preſent Treaty, he ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
re-inſtated for himſelf, his Heirs, and Succeſſors,
into the free and full Poſſeſſion of the States, Poſſeſſions,
and Goods which Duke <hi>Charles</hi> his Uncle by the Father's
Side, was poſſeſt of in the Year, 1670. at ſuch time as the
Moſt Chriſtian King ſeized upon them; excepting notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Alterations and Changes explain'd in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Articles.</p>
                        <p>XXIX. His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhall particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to the ſaid Duke the Old and New City of <hi>Nancy,</hi> with all its Appurtenances, and the Artillery that was found in
the Old City at the time of its being taken; upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
nevertheleſs, That all the Ramparts and Baſtions of
the Old City remaining intire, with the Gates of the New,
the Ramparts and Baſtions of this latter, as alſo the whole
exteriour Fortifications of both, ſhall be intirely razed at
the ſole Charge of the Moſt Chriſtian King, never to be
any more re-built for time to come: Except the ſaid Duke
and his Succeſſors ſhall have a mind when they pleaſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
the New City with a ſingle dry Wall, without a
Flank.</p>
                        <p>XXX. His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhall likewiſe cauſe the Caſtle of <hi>Bitſch</hi> to be evacuated, with all its Appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; as alſo the Caſtle of <hi>Homburg,</hi> by cauſing all the
Fortifications to be razed before-hand, that they may never
more be repaired; yet ſo that the foreſaid Caſtles and Cities
that are adjacent thereto, may receive no Damage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
but may remain totally untouch'd.</p>
                        <p>XXXI. Upon the whole, Whatſoever hath been ordered as above-ſaid in the IVth Article, in reference to Unions and Re-unions, ſhall be as ſerviceable and advantageous to
the ſaid Duke, as if it had been here repeated <hi>verbatim,</hi> in
what Place and after what Manner the foreſaid Unions and
Re-unions have been made and ordained.</p>
                        <p>XXXII. His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty reſerves to himſelf the Fortreſs of <hi>Saar-Louis,</hi> with half a League round about it, which ſhall be marked out and limitted by the Commiſſioners
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:62930:333"/>
of his ſaid Majeſty, and by thoſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> by him to be
poſſeſs'd Sovereignly for ever.</p>
                        <p>XXXIII. The City and Prefectſhip of <hi>Longwi,</hi> together with all its Appurtenances and Dependences, ſhall alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Power of the ſaid Moſt Chriſtian King, his Heirs
and Succeſſors, with all Superiority, Sovereignty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
without the ſaid Duke his Heirs or Succeſſors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
henceforward to claim any Right therein; but in
exchange of the ſaid City and Prefectſhip, his ſaid Moſt
Chriſtian Majeſty will put another Prefectſhip into the Hands
of the ſaid Duke, in one of the three Biſhopricks, of the
ſame Extent and Value, whereof the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhall
<hi>bona fide</hi> agree upon. And the ſaid Prefectſhip ſo made over
and conveyed by the Moſt Chriſtian King to the ſaid Duke,
he the ſaid Duke, as well as his Heirs and Succeſſors, ſhall
poſſeſs it to the Words end, with all the Rights of Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Sovereignty and Property.</p>
                        <p>XXXIV. The Paſſage ſhall be always open through the Territories of the ſaid Duke, without any Obſtacle or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, to the Moſt Chriſtian King's Troops, who ſhall
go or come from the Frontiers; upon Condition neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
that timely Notice of it ſhall be given before-hand;
that the Soldier that paſſes ſhall not go out of his Way,
but may purſue the ſhorteſt and uſual Way, and duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his Road as he ought, without delay. He ſhall not
commit any Violence, nor do any Damage to the Places and
Subjects of the Duke, and ſhall pay ready Money for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
and other Neceſſaries that ſhall be delivered to him
by the Commiſſioners of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> Mutually aboliſhing and
cauſing the High-ways and Places that his Moſt Chriſtian
Majeſty had reſerved to himſelf by the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi>
to return to the Power and Juriſdiction of the Duke without
any Exception.</p>
                        <p>XXXV. The Eccleſiaſtical Benefices conferred by his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty till the very day of the preſent Treaty, ſhall remain in the Enjoyment and Poſſeſſion of thoſe who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
them at preſent, and who have obtained them of his
Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, without being liable to be diſturbed
therein.</p>
                        <p>XXXVI. It hath more-over been concluded, That the Law-Suits, Sentences, and Decrees paſſed by the Council, Judges, and other his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty Officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Differences and Actions that have been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
as well between the Subjects of the Dutchies of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
and of <hi>Barr,</hi> as others, at the time when the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

their full and due effect, in the ſame manner as if his ſaid
Chriſtian Majeſty had remained in full Poſſeſſion of his ſaid

Eſtates, it not being permitted to call in queſtion the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of the ſaid Sentences and Decrees, or to impede or
ſtop the Execution thereof. It ſhall notwithſtanding be
permitted to the Parties to demand a Review of what ſhall
have been enacted according to the Order and Diſpoſition
of the Laws and Conſtitutions, the Sentences nevertheleſs
remaining in their full Force and Vertue.</p>
                        <p>XXXVII. There ſhall be reſtored to the ſaid Duke, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ratification of the preſent Treaty, the Archives and written Documents and Preſidents that was in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
of the Records of <hi>Nancy</hi> and <hi>Barr,</hi> and in both Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Accounts or other places, and that have been taken
thence.</p>
                        <p>XXXVIII. The ſaid Duke immediately after the Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Peace, ſhall have Power to ſend Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Dutchies of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barr,</hi> to have a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eye upon his Affairs, Adminiſter Juſtice, take care of
the Impoſts, Taxes upon Salt, and other Duties, diſpoſe of
publick Treaties, and perform all other neceſſary things, ſo
that the ſaid Duke may within the ſame time enter into the
full poſſeſſion of his Government.</p>
                        <p>XXXIX. As to what relates to Impoſts and Cuſtoms, and concerning the Exemption in the Tranſportation of Salt or Wood, either by Land or Water, the Cuſtom ſettled in the
Year 1670. ſhall be obſerved, without permitting any Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                        <p>XL. The ancient Cuſtom and Liberty of Commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Lorrain</hi> and the Biſhopricks of <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

XLIV. The Cardinal of <hi>Furſtemburg</hi> ſhall be re-inveſted
in all the Rights, Eſtates, Feudal and Allodial, Benefices,
Honours and Prerogatives, that belong to the Princes and
Members of the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as well in reſpect of
the Biſhoprick of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> on the Right-hand of the <hi>Rhine,</hi>
as of the Abby of <hi>Stevelo</hi> and others; and ſhall enjoy, with
his Couſins and Relations that adhered to his Party, and
his Domeſtick Servants, a full and abſolute Amneſty, and
Security, for whatſoever hath been done or ſaid, and for
whatſoever hath been decreed againſt him or them; and
that neither He, his Heirs, Couſins, Relations, nor Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
ſhall ever be proceeded againſt in any Cauſe by the
Lords Electors of <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> their Heirs, or any

Lord Cardinal, his Couſins, Relations, and Domeſticks, or
any that have any Cauſe depending upon their Behalf, ſhall

Lords Electors, or others, from the ſaid Inheritance, Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

their Prependaries, or Canonical Benefices, ſhall receive the

Benefices, and Dignities, and in the ſame Degree and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in the Chapter of the Collegiate Churches and Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
Church, as they were before their Depoſition. Yet ſo
however, that the Revenues remaining in the Power of

there is no queſtion but this may be approved of by the

The Heirs likewiſe of the Canons who have been deprived
of their Dignity, and are dead during the War, whoſe Goods,

time of the Concluſion and Signing of this Treaty; and all
that hath been ſaid in this Article, ſhall be executed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

the Perſons abſent not being heard to ſpeak for themſelves;
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:62930:335"/>
which ſaid Sentences ſhall be null, and of none effect, and
look'd upon as though they had never been pronounc'd;
they, all of them, being left to their Liberty to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Country, to enter upon their aforeſaid Eſtates, and
enjoy them, as well as their Rents and Revenues, or to go,
ſojourn and take up their Habitation elſewhere, in what
place they ſhall think fit, and ſuch as they have a mind to
make Choice of, without any Violence or Conſtraint. And
in ſuch a Caſe it ſhall be permitted to them to cauſe their
Eſtates and revenues to be adminiſtred by Sollicitors, or
Proctors, that are not ſuſpected, and may peaceably enjoy
them; excepting only Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, that require
Reſidence, which ſhall be regulated and adminiſtred perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
Laſtly, It ſhall be free for every Subject of either
Party to ſell, exchange, alieniate, and convey by Teſtament,
Deed of Gift, or otherwiſe, their Eſtates, Goods, moveable

poſſeſs in the States or Dominions of another Sovereign; ſo
that any ones Subject, or a Foreigner, may buy them, or

from the Sovereign, beſides that which is contained in this
preſent Article.</p>
                        <p>XLVII. If any Eccleſiaſtical Benefices mediate, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate have been during this War conferr'd by one of the Parties in the Territories and Places that were under his
Dominion, upon Perſons qualified, according to the Canon
or Rule of their firſt Inſtitution, and the Lawful Statutes
general or particular made on this behalf, or by any other
Canonical diſpoſal made by the Pope. The ſaid Eccleſiaſtical
Benefices ſhall be left to the preſent Poſſeſſors, as likewiſe
the Eccleſiaſtical Benefices conferr'd after this manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this War, in the Places that ought to be reſtored by
the preſent Peace; ſo that henceforth no Perſon may, or
ought to trouble or moleſt them in the Poſſeſſion and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Adminiſtration of the ſame; neither in receiving the
Fruits and Benefits, nor upon that account may they at any
time be preſented, ſummoned, or cited to appear in a

diſcharge themſelves honeſtly, and perform what they are
bound to by vertue of the ſaid Benefices.</p>
                        <p>XLVIII. Foraſmuch as it conduceth much to the publick Peace and Tranquility, that the Peace concluded at <hi>Turin,</hi>
the 29th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1696. between his Moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and his Royal Highneſs, be exactly and duly obſerved,
it hath likewiſe been found expedient to confirm it, and
to compriſe it in this preſent Treaty, and to make it of
the ſame Value, and for ever to ſubſiſt and be in Force. The
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:62930:336"/>
Points that have been regulated in favour of the Houſe of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> in the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia and Nimeguen</hi> re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
above, are confirmed in particular, and judged as
here repeated word for word; yet ſo nevertheleſs, that
the Reſtitution of <hi>Pignerol</hi> and its Dependences, already
made, may not in any caſe diminiſh or alter the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherein his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty hath engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to pay to the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> the Sum of Four hundred
ninety four thouſand Crowns, for diſcharge of the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> as is explained more at large in the Treaty of the
Peace of <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi> And to the end that this may be more
fully and more ſtrongly confirmed, All, and every One,
the Princes, that participate of the General Peace, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and will reciprocally receive
from him the Promiſes and Securities, that they ſtipulate
among themſelves for a more firm Aſſurance of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>XLIX. Upon the whole, it is not meant that by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Reſtitution of Places, Perſons, Eſtates, Rights made or to be made by <hi>France,</hi> there is acquired any new Right
to ſuch as are, or ſhall be ſo re-eſtabliſh'd. But that if
any other have any Claim or Pretenſion againſt them, they
ſhall be propounded, examined and decided in a convenient
place, after the making of the ſaid Reſtitution, which for
this reaſon ought by no means to be deferred.</p>
                        <p>L. So ſoon as ever the preſent Treaty of Peace ſhall have been Signed and Sealed by the Lords Extraordinary Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors and Plenipotentiaries, all Hoſtilities and Violence of
what Nature ſoever ſhall ceaſe, as alſo all demoliſhing of
Edifices, all Devaſtations of Vineyards and Foreſts, all fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Trees; immediately after the Exchange of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
all the Troops ſhall be made to retire from the
unfortified Places belonging to the other Party. And as for
what concerns fortified Places that are to be reſtored by the
preſent Treaty, they ſhall within Thirty days after the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the Peace, or ſooner, if poſſible, be ſurrendred
to and put into the Hands of thoſe that are nominated in
the preceding Articles; or, if not expreſly nominated, then
to thoſe who did poſſeſs them immediately before their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken; without any demoliſhing of Fortifications or Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
either publick or private, without making them in a
worſe Condition than they are at preſent, or without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
any thing for or by reaſon of any Expences in the
ſaid Places; and the Soldiers ſhall not exact any thing upon

As for all ſorts of Demolitions to be made purſuant to
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:62930:336"/>
the Agreements above, it ſhall be wholly and effectually
performed, in reſpect of the leſs conſiderable things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Month if poſſible, and in reſpect of the more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
within two Months if it may be done, without any
Expence or Trouble to the other Party for the ſaid Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe ſhall all the Archives, Records, Literal Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be faithfully reſtored immediately after the Exchange of the Ratifications, as well thoſe which belong to the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that are to be ſurrendred and deliver'd to his Imperial
Majeſty's Empire, and to its States and Members, as thoſe
that have been remov'd and convey'd from the Chamber
and City of <hi>Spires,</hi> and other places of the Empire, altho'
there may be no particular mention made thereof in the
preſent Treaty. The Priſoners taken upon occaſion of the
War, ſhall alſo be releas'd, and ſet at liberty on both ſides,
without any Ranſom, and in particular ſuch who have been
condemned to the Gallies, or to any other publick Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                        <p>LI. And to the end that the Subjects of both Parties may ſpeedily enjoy the intire Benefit of this Peace, it hath been agreed, That all Contributions of Money, Grain, Wine, of
Forage, Wood, and Cattel, or the like, altho' already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

have been ſettled and ſtated by Agreement; as alſo, that all
Foraging of what nature ſoever, upon the Territories and
Juriſdiction of one another, ſhall totally ceaſe upon the very
day of the Ratification, and what ſhall be due in Arrears
for ſuch like Contributions, Impoſitions or Exactions, ſhall
be totally aboliſh'd. In like manner the Hoſtages delivered
or carried away during this War, for what cauſe ſoever,
ſhall be reſtor'd, without farther delay, and that without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oblig'd to pay any thing for the ſame.</p>
                        <p>LII. In like manner the Commerce prohibited during the War between the Subjects of his Imperial Majeſty and the Empire, and thoſe of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and of
the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> ſhall be re-eſtabliſh'd preſently after
the Signing of this Peace, with the ſame liberty as before
the War, and ſhall, All, and every One of them, and more
particularly the Inhabitants and Citizens of the Hans-Towns,
Enjoy all manner of Security by Sea and Land, together
with their Ancient Rights, Immunities, Privileges and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
obtained by Solemn Treaties, or by Ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom.</p>
                        <p>LIII. Whatſoever is concluded and agreed upon by this Treaty ſhall be firm and inviolable to perpetuity; and ſhall be obſerved and put in execution notwithſtanding whatſoever
might have been believed, alledged, or imagined to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:62930:337"/>
which remains altogether cancelled and aboliſhed,
altho' it might be of ſuch a nature, that we might have been
obliged to make a more ample and more particular mention
of the ſame; or, altho' the cancelling and abrogation ſeem
as if it ought to be lookt upon as null, invalid, and of none
effect.</p>
                        <p>LIV. Each of the Stipulating contracting Parties ſhall be capable of confirming this preſent Peace, and his obſervance of it, by certain Alliances, by Fortifications upon his own
proper Ground, except in the Places in eſpecial manner above
excepted, the which they may build, or inlarge, put Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
into, and uſe other means they ſhall judge moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for their defence. It ſhall likewiſe be permitted as
well to all the Kings, Princes and Republicks in General:
As to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in particular as Mediator, to give
their Guarantie to his Imperial Majeſty and Empire, and to
his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, juſt as it was by vertue of the

                        </p>
                        <p>LV. And foraſmuch as his Imperial Majeſty and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty do acknowledg with Sentiments of Gratitude, the continual Cares and good Offices,

                        <p>FOR the clearer Explanation of the eighth Article of the Treaty of Peace this Day Signed, which Article begins thus, <hi>All the States poſſeſt by the moſt Chriſtian King ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to the Elector Palatine,</hi> It hath been thought convenient
to reſolve over and above, that this Order will be obſerved
in the Propoſal of the Claims and Rights of <hi>Madame</hi> the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi> exhibited againſt the Elector Palatine;
at ſuch time as the Arbitrators ſhall be agreed at the time
appointed for the Ratification of the Peace about a Place to
meet in, this Place ſhall be notified to each Party. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
on the Arbitrators part ſhall be ſent thither within
the ſpace of two Months, to reckon from the very time the
Elector Palatine ſhall be fully re-eſtabliſhed; in conformity
to the Article above-mention'd. In the Month following
ſhall the ſaid Lady Dutcheſs produce in the ſame place, the
whole and intire explanation of her Pretenſions or Demands
againſt the Elector, which ſhall be communicated to him
within eight Days following. There ſhall be within the
ſpace of four Months next enſuing, explain'd and delivered to
the Deputies of the Lords Arbitrators, who ſhall ſet down the
day that the four Months ſhall begin, the Reaſons and Grounds
of the two Parties, wherof four Copies ſhall be delivered; that
is to ſay, one for each Arbitrator, and a third to be annext to
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:62930:338"/>
the common Acts of the Arbitration, and a fourth to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
communicated within ſeven Days to each Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
They ſhall in like manner anſwer; and four Copies of
the Anſwer of each Party ſhall be given the ſame Day to
the Envoys of the Lords Arbitrators, which ſhall be once
more communicated within ſeven Days to the Parties inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably.
In the four Months following, the Inſtruction
of the Buſineſs ſhall be terminated on each ſide, the Parties
ſhall declare they are willing to ſubmit to the Verdict of
the Arbitrators, and this concluſion of the Inſtruction and
Commiſſion ſhall be communicated to the Parties, that they
may take cogniſance of the ſame; and the Deeds ſhall be
Enrolled in preſence of the Solicitors of the ſaid Parties. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the Arbitrators and their Deputies who ſhall have
taken an Oath, having viewed and examined the Right of
the Parties during the ſpace of ſix Months enſuing, ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their Sentence publickly in the place where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is held, according to the Laws and Conſtitutions of
the Empire; now if it be found conformable it ſhall be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
put in execution; but if ſo be the Arbitrators or
their Deputies do not agree in their Verdict, the common
Acts of the Arbitration ſhall be conveyed to <hi>Rome</hi> at the joint
Charges of the Parties, and that within the ſpace of two
Months, beginning at the Day next enſuing the Judgment
given, and ſhall be delivered to the Pope as Supreme Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator,
to be committed by him for its Examination with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſix Months more to Deputies, no way ſuſpected by the
Parties, who ſhall likewiſe be ſworn, and theſe ſame upon
the former Proceedings (it not being allowed to the Parties
to draw up a new Declaration of their Titles) ſhall pronounce
within the ſpace of ſix Months next enſuing, and as it hath
been ſaid, conformable to the Laws and Conſtitutions of the
Empire, the laſt Definitive Sentence, which cannot be nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or made void, but the Lord Arbitrators ſhall cauſe
to be executed without any delay or contradiction. Now if
ſo be one of the Parties demurr, and delay to propound, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
and prove his Title and Right within the time required,
it ſhall nevertheleſs be lawful for the other Party to explain
and deduce his Title within the time prefixt, which may
never be prolonged; and lawful alſo for the Arbitrators and
Supreme Arbitrator to proceed according to the method juſt
now explain'd, and to pronounce and execute their Sentence,
according to the Acts and Deeds produced and proved.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding this procedure, the Parties themſelves, and the Lords Arbitrators on their part ſhall not ceaſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting ſome amicable way of accommodation; and ſhall
omit nothing that may any way contribute to the amicable
terminating this Affair.—Since it is alſo agreed in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:62930:339"/>
title of Peace afore cited, that till this difference be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
the Elector Palatine ſhall Annually pay to <hi>Madam</hi> the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Sum of 200000 <hi>French</hi> Livres, or an
100000 Florins of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> they have alſo agreed in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

it ſhall commence; that it ſhall commence only, after that
(according to the Contents of the ſaid Article) the States and
Places therein ſpecified ſhall be intirely reſtored to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
And to the end that <hi>Madam</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi>
may be the more aſſured of the payment of the ſaid Sum;
the Elector ſhall nominate before the Ratification of the
Peace, a ſufficient number of Renters, or Receivers of the
Prefectſhip of <hi>Germerſheim,</hi> and other places of the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that ſhall undertake to pay the ſaid Sum to the ſaid

Year at <hi>Landaw,</hi> to wit, the moiety every ſix Months;
who if they do not keep time ſhall be lyable to be conſtrained
to the payment, by the ordinary courſe of Juſtice, or if need
require by Military execution from the Moſt Chriſtian King.
Upon the whole, this payment ſhall be made upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>viz.</hi> That what ſhall have been paid by vertue of
this Annual Obligation to <hi>Madam</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi> dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

be in compenſation and put upon the accompt of that which
the ſaid Arbitrators ſhall adjudge to her, in caſe they do
adjudge any thing at all; but if ſo be they adjudge nothing,
or leſs than the ſaid Sum, then there ſhall be a reſtitution,
and this compenſation, allowance or reſtitution, as alſo the
fund and charges of the Proceſs ſhall be regulated by the
Sentence of the Arbitrators: But if <hi>Madam</hi> the Dutcheſs of
<hi>Orleans</hi> do not give ſatisfaction to the form of the Compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
either in the Inſtruction of the Proceſs, or in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that ſhall be produced by the Elector Palatine, or if
ſhe delays it, the courſe of the ſaid yearly payment ſhall be
interrupted only during that ſame time, the Proceſs going on
ſtill, according to the form of the Compromiſe.</p>

            <p>'Tis not my Buſineſs to anſwer the fooliſh Objections ſome ill-willed Perſons have made againſt the ſtability of this Peace. However I ſhall obſerve, That tho this Peace with
the Empire was not ſo advantageous to it, and the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> not in ſo ample a manner as could have been
wiſhed for; yet if it be conſidered that <hi>France</hi> has given up
very conſiderably on this ſide, and ſome places ſhe had long
been poſſeſſed off, particularly <hi>Briſac,</hi> which hath apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to that Crown for very near 60 Years; That by the
Taking of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and the Peace with <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſhe is entirely
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:62930:339"/>
precluded out of <hi>Italy;</hi> that the ſame Barrier is left in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia</hi>
as before; And that there is a ſtronger Frontier in
the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> by her Reſtitution of all ſhe took ſince the
beginning of the War, with the Addition of <hi>Dinant</hi> and <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg;</hi>
If theſe be put together, it's not likely, that Crown
will begin another War in haſt, whatſoever our Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
at home, or any Enemies we have abroad may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atter
themſelves with, eſpecially conſidering the inward weakneſs
of that Kingdom, and the ſtrong Union there is between the
Crown of <hi>England</hi> and the Republick of <hi>Holland,</hi> whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Powers are ſo Formidable, and Intereſts ſo great in all the
Parts of the World. Over and above all this, we are to
note, His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty is now in an advanced Age,
which is uſually attended with an ill Habit of Body; and too
wiſe a Prince, eaſily to be brought to engage himſelf in the
Toils and Uncertainties of another War; eſpecially, in that
there was ſo little gained, or I ſhould have rather ſaid, ſo
much loſt by this: To ſay nothing of that Regard he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
have to the Intereſts of his Poſterity, as well as
his Dominions; whoſe Affairs, at his Death, he will be very
unwilling to leave embroiled with thoſe of their Neighbours.
It remains therefore now, that I take notice that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
King <hi>William</hi> ſtaid in <hi>Holland</hi> till all was over, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having very Honourably paid off all the Forreign Troops,
who by this time were Marching to their reſpective Homes
after the Toyls of this long War, He returned to <hi>England,</hi>
and upon the 16th of <hi>November,</hi> at the Citizens requeſt,
made His Publick Entry thro' <hi>London,</hi> being attended by all
the Men of Quality in very great State, and never, (I am
ſure,) in one Day ſaw ſo many People (and all of them His
own Subjects) in all His Life-time; and in whoſe Affections
He Triumphed as much as ever he had done at any time
over His Enemies; and may He always do the firſt, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have occaſion for the ſecond, but may we long live under
the Benign Influence of His Reign, who hath Reſcued our
Religion and Liberties out of the Jaws of Hell and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

THE War, which I Entred into by the Advice of my People,
is by the Bleſſing of God, and their Zealous and Affectionate
Aſſiſtance, brought to the End We all propoſed, an Honourable
Peace; which I was willing to Conclude, not ſo much to Eaſe My

but the Funds intended for the laſt Year's Service have fallen ſhort

remain conſiderable Deficiencies to be Provided for.</p>
               <p>There's a Debt upon the Account of the Fleet and the Army.</p>

Intereſt and Reputation of <hi>England,</hi> to have always a great Strength

               <p>The Circumſtances of Affairs Abroad are ſuch, that I think My Self obliged to tell you My Opinion, that for the preſent, <hi>England</hi>

that the ſo ſudden diſappearances of it made it to vulgar

However, this was but a Flea-bite to what the Nation had
gone thro' in the courſe of the War;<note place="margin">Parliament proceedings.</note> and ſo our Parliament
went tightly to work upon the Affairs of the Nation; and
finding the buſineſs of our Coin pretty well remedied, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the currency of any hammered Silver Mony would be any
longer a grievance, they made an Act to prevent it, and for
the Recoining of ſuch as was then in being, as alſo for making
out new Exchequer Bills, where the former Bills were or
ſhould be filled up by Endorſements. It was moreover far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſidered by them, that whereas now by the Peace
there would be a free intercourſe between <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> it was enacted there ſhould be no Correſpondence
held with the late King nor his Adherents upon any account;
They alſo took care to diſcharge and ſatisfie the Arrears
of ſeveral Annuities that incurred between the 17th of <hi>May,</hi>
1696. and <hi>May</hi> 17th, 1697. But that you may not think
they forgot the diſbanding of the Army, paying of Seamen,
and ſuch things, they gave to his Majeſty no leſs than the
Sum of 1484015 <hi>l.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> 11 <hi>d.</hi> 3/1 <hi>f.</hi> to which we may add the

Debt for the Reduction of <hi>Ireland;</hi> Beſides a great

could pretend to at that time of day; And that all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
might be had to his Majeſty's Honour and Support,
they granted a Subſidy upon Tunnage and Poundage, for
the raiſing of Seven Hundred Thouſand Pounds a Year,
for the Service of his Houſhold. Abundance of other Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs

               <note place="margin">King's Speech.</note> When his Majeſty was pleaſed to tell

Remedying the Coin, reſtoring ſuch Supplies for

                        <p>V. In caſe any Prince or State will enter into this Treaty within a Year, they ſhall be admitted by the conſent of both Kings.</p>
                        <p>VI. Neither the one nor the other ſhall make Peace or Truce without comprehending the other therein.</p>
                        <p>VII. The Articles of the Treaties formerly concluded by either of the two with other Kings, Princes, or States, ſhall remain in their full Strength and Vertue, ſo far as they ſhall
not be contrary to this.</p>
                        <p>VIII. The Freedom of Commerce between the Subjects of the two Kings, ſhall be preſerv'd as formerly, without any Impeachment, as well in time of War as in Peace, paying the
uſual Duties.</p>
                        <p>IX. In purſuance of which, all Ports, Cities and Provinces ſhall be open to the Subjects of both Crowns, according as the Laws and Cuſtoms ſhall permit, both to ſell their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
in thoſe Places, and buy others.</p>

X. This particular Treaty ſhall continue Ten Years, with
Liberty to prolong this Term, if it be judg'd convenient by

the means to preſerve the Peace againſt the Dangers that
threaten it.</p>
                        <p>XI. This Treaty ſhall be exchang'd by both ſides within three Months after the Signing, or ſooner if it may be.</p>

               </note> with the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Affairs, and obſerve, that
tho' the King's Competitor was now gone without any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
of ever returning again, and that the potent City of
<hi>Danzick</hi> were firm to his Intereſt, yet other Difficulties,
from the Obſtinacy of the Cardinal Primate and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and from the preſent Neceſſity he lay under to be
guarded in <hi>Poland</hi> with his own Troops, made his Affairs
much perplex'd; However, he ſet forward and arrived at
<hi>Warſaw, January</hi> the 14th, in great State. The King us'd
all imaginable Endeavours to bring the Primate to ſubmit,
and the Offices of the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Miniſter were indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to this end, but the ſtubborn old Gentleman ſhew'd
altogether as much Averſion on the other hand, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Senators, Lords, and Gentlemen that were confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated
in the <hi>Rocoſche,</hi> to meet the 18th of <hi>February.</hi> To
encounter which, in ſome meaſure, the King thought of no
better way than to iſſue out his Circular Letters, to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the Dyet of Pacification to Aſſemble on the 16th of
<hi>April;</hi> But this being thought not ſufficient, as ſoon as the
<hi>Rocoſche</hi> was met at <hi>Lowitz,</hi> the King ſent the Grand Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
of the Crown, and the Great Treaſurer of <hi>Lithuania</hi> as
his Deputies thither, with a Letter alſo from his Majeſty
to the Aſſemby. But the Title of Commiſſioners, and ſome
Expreſſions in the Letter, which were thought too ſmart,
offended the <hi>Rocoſche</hi> to that degree, that they not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to admit the Deputies, but they were alſo forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to the Caſtle of <hi>Lowitz,</hi> after a narrow Eſcape from
ſome Danger: Nay, the Common People grew ſo inſolent
that they fired upon the Windows of the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy's
Lodgings, notwithſtanding his publick Character, and
the Prohibitions of the Cardinal Primate to the contrary.
The Deputies hereupon ſent preſently Advice of what had
paſſed, to the King, who ſent them another Letter, with
new Powers; However, after ſome Conteſtation, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Letter, and then drew up the following Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:</p>
            <p>1. POſitive Aſſurances were demanded from <hi>Rome</hi> of the Change of the King's Religion.<note place="margin">The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of the <hi>Rocoſche.</hi>
               </note> 2. That the Queen ſhould embrace the ſame Religion. 3. That it ſhould be alſo
ſettl'd in <hi>Saxony.</hi> 4. That the Provinces diſmember'd from
the Crown, ſhould be re-united. 5. That an account ſhould
be given of the Money that had been expended. 6. That
the <hi>Pacta Conventa</hi> ſhould be drawn up by themſelves, and
preſented by the Marſhall of the <hi>Rocoſche.</hi> 7. That the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Employments which had been diſpos'd of, ſhould be
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:62930:343"/>
confirm'd by new Pattents. 8. That all the Foreign Forces
ſhould be ſent away. 9. That in conſideration of the Damages
done by the Saxon Soldiers, the Elector ſhould grant Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Quarters
to the Polanders, in the Countries under his
Dominion. 10. That no Employments ſhould be given to
Foreigners. 11. That the <hi>Indigenat</hi> granted to the Houſe
of <hi>Saxony</hi> ſhould not extend beyond the Electoral Branch.
12. That being acknowledg'd for King, he ſhould not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the Title of Elector. 13. That the Damages done
by the Army ſhould be repair'd at the Expences of the
Grand General. 14. That all the Officers of the Army,
and of the King's Guards ſhould be Roman Catholicks.
15. That all unprofitable Foreigners, ſhould be ſent away.
16. That the City of <hi>Danzick</hi> ſhould have Reparation for
the Damages ſuſtain'd by the War, upon the Account of his
Electoral Highneſs. 17. That a Decree ſhould be publiſh'd
againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Cujavia,</hi> by which he ſhould be forbid
to Crown any King. 18. That Enquiry ſhould be made
into the Violence that was made uſe of in forcing the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
that the like Attempt may be prevented for the future.
19. That the Eccleſiaſticks ſhall not be moleſted in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of their Eſtates. 20. That General <hi>Brandt</hi> ſhall be
proſecuted in the Courts of Juſtice, for the Damages done
by his Men; for which Satisfaction ſhall be given. 21. That
all Acts made during this Fraction or Diviſion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
ſhall be cancell'd and made void.</p>
            <p>Some there were for all this, who ſubmitted to the King, who notwithſtanding the ill Succeſs of the ſaid Aſſembly, and their exorbitant Demands, reſolved upon his Journey into
<hi>Pruſſia;</hi> And on the 17th of <hi>March,</hi> arrived near <hi>Danzick,</hi>
into which place he made his Publick Entry with great Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,
was treated moſt ſplendidly, and on the 25th, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Homage of the City, after he had confirm'd their
Privileges, and taken an Oath to maintain them according
to the uſual Form; But his Majeſty all this while did not
forget to notifie his Advancement to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Throne in
all the Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and Major General <hi>Jordan</hi> was
more particularly ſent into <hi>France</hi> upon that occaſion.<note place="margin">The Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cio his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> In the
mean time Seignior <hi>Paulucci,</hi> the Pope's Extraordinary
Nuncio, arrived at <hi>Warſaw;</hi> And becauſe the King was then
abſent at <hi>Danzick,</hi> he ſent to <hi>Lowitz</hi> to give the Primate
notice of his Arrival, and preſently after went to Viſit his
Eminency, at the ſame time conſigning the Pope's Brief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Hands, whereby he was exhorted to employ his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Care to ſettle the Tranquility of <hi>Poland,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and procure the farther Advantage of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion; Aſſuring him, That he had ordered his
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:62930:344"/>
Nuncio to omit nothing upon all Occaſions, that might tend
to the Preſervation of the Rights and Priviledges of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency:
To which the Cardinal anſwered, That he would
always ſubmit to his Holineſs in Spirituals; That if his
Holineſs, after he had ſeriouſly examined the State of things,
were of Opinion the Roman Catholick Religion was ſafe,
he was willing to believe ſo too: But as to what concerned
the Temporal Intereſts of the Republick, he could not quit
them without Injury to his own Character and Dignity,
without drawing upon himſelf the Reproach of the Nation,
and without being brought under a Neceſſity of becoming an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
for it in his own Perſon; However, that he accepted
the Mediation of the Holy Father with a filial Obedience.</p>
            <p>This was a pretty good Pace, for tho' the Dyet of Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, upon the King's return, meeting upon the time appointed, made but a very ſmall Appearance, and that
ſome of them flung out of the Aſſembly, with a Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and perſiſting in their Demands, of a Dyet to be held
on Horſe-back; Yet the Cardinal Primate, who was to have
held the Aſſembly of the <hi>Rocoſche, April</hi> 15th, put the ſame
off till the 5th of <hi>May:</hi> And when they then met, there
was but a very ſmall Appearance, and all the Oppoſition
they pretended to make ſignified nothing: For the good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Nuncio at length, ſo far prevailed, that on the
16th of <hi>May</hi> the Treaty of Accommodation was fairly writ,<note place="margin">Brings the Primate to ſubmit.</note>
publickly read with all its Explanations, and then ſigned
by the Commiſſioners, as the King's Plenipotentiaries, by
the Cardinal Primate, Marſhal of the <hi>Rocoſche,</hi> Deputies of
the Palatinates that were preſent, and by Seignior <hi>Paulucci,</hi>
as Mediator and Guarrantee of the Treaty. The Articles
conſiſted of twelve Particulars to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>1. THat the King ſhall uſe his utmoſt Endeavour to bring over the Queen to the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that he ſhall prove by viſible, uncontroulable, and
authentick Teſtimonies, and ſuch, in a word, which the
Primate and the Pope's Nuncio ſhall deem proper, that he
has effectually embrac'd the Catholick Religion.</p>
            <p>2. That he ſhall diſmiſs all the Lutheran Miniſters that are in his Army.</p>
            <p>3. That he ſhall give an Authentick Act to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by which he ſhall conſent, that the Liberty of Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Elections ſhall be reſtor'd; and promiſe never to
re-demand the vaſt Sums which the Crown has coſt him.</p>
            <p>4. That he ſhall pay all the Arrears which are due to the Army of the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="681" facs="tcp:62930:344"/>
5. That he ſhall employ his own Soldiers in the Siege of
<hi>Caminiec,</hi> and for the Recovery of <hi>Podolia,</hi> which ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
be re-united and incorporated in the Crown.</p>
            <p>6. That then he ſhall ſend back his Soldiers into <hi>Saxony,</hi>
and repair the Damages done by his Saxon Soldiers.</p>
            <p>7. That he ſhall revoke the Conceſſions of Crown-Lands, and take 'em away from thoſe on whom he has beſtow'd 'em, and that the Revenues thereof ſhall be employ'd toward the
Subſiſtance of his Houſhold.</p>
            <p>8. That he ſhall revoke and diſannul all the Proteſtations which he made againſt the Primate, and the Heads of the <hi>Rocoſche.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. That he ſhall confer no Employments, Benefices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but upon Polanders, who ſhall profeſs the Roman Catholick
Religion; and that the Members of the <hi>Rocoſche</hi> ſhall be
preferr'd before others, in the Diſtribution of publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
            <p>10. That the River <hi>Piſca</hi> ſhall be made Navigable at the King's Expences.</p>
            <p>11. That after the Expedition to <hi>Caminiec</hi> is ended, a General Dyet of Pacification ſhall be call'd; and that in the mean time his Majeſty ſhall, by his Circulatory Letters,
give notice of the Treaty of Agreement to all the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>12. That the Tribunals ſhall remain ſuſpended, till the King be again confirm'd in the Poſſeſſion of the Crown.</p>
            <p>This being over, the Cardinal went in great State to wait upon the King, who received him in the Marble Chamber, and according to Cuſtom advanced ſome few
Paces to receive him, and to whom his Eminency made the
following Speech in French.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>SIR,</hi>
IF I have the Misfortune to preſent my ſelf among the
laſt,<note place="margin">The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare's Speech to the King.</note> to pay my moſt humble Reſpects to Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
I have the Satisfaction to bring You the Fruits of a
long Expectation, the Hearts of Your Subjects, and the
Repoſe of Your Kingdom. It was not for a Perſon of my
Character to appear without theſe two Guides, which
in regard they are to be the chief Ornaments of Your
Reign, I place 'em at the Feet of Your Throne, wiſhing
that whatever eterniz'd the Renown of the Great <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi>
may be accompliſh'd in Your Majeſty's Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
to whom I have conſecrated my Devotion, and my

            <p>
               <pb n="682" facs="tcp:62930:345"/>
But tho' this Agreement we find thus to be at length
happily accompliſh'd in <hi>Poland,</hi> yet things in <hi>Lithuania</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
all this while in utmoſt confuſion;<note place="margin">The Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuania.</hi>
               </note> the Party of the
Great General <hi>Sapieha</hi> and that of <hi>Oginski</hi>'s, the Great Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
Bearer, with whom ſided the major part of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
ſeeming to remain Irreconcilable; and the demands of
the latter were ſo exorbitant, as if they ſeemed to be made
on purpoſe to prevent an Accommodation; However, dire
Neceſſity having no Law, and the King being eager to go
into the Field, he ſigned the Articles propoſed by them,
wherein, among other Things, the inſeparable Union and
Coaequation of the Rights and Priviledges of the Grand-Dutchy
of <hi>Lithuania</hi> with the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> were agreed
on, and both ſides bound by Oath to the obſervance of this
Coaequation; That the Imployments of the Great General
Mareſchal and Treaſurer, ſhould ſtill remain, but with no
other Priviledges than thoſe allowed to the ſame Officers of
<hi>Poland;</hi> that the Army ſhould not exceed 9000 Men; That
as for the Treaſurers paying the Army no longer, unleſs it
were in the Preſence of the Palatines, that Point ſhould be
referred to the Approbation of the General Diet; That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and Damages ſuſtained on either ſide ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and any new Differences that might ariſe, ſhould be
left to the Arbitration of the next Diet: But ſo unhappily it
fell out, that while they were labouring to bring this Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
to bear,<note place="margin">A Fight in <hi>Lithuania.</hi>
               </note> a Bloody Fight happened between <hi>Oginski</hi>'s
Forces and thoſe of the Great General, commanded by his
Son, wherein the former was defeated, loſt four Field-pieces
and his Baggage, had part of his Men Killed, part Drowned
in the <hi>Mimnell,</hi> while the reſt fled one and another way, the
Great Enſign himſelf making an hard ſhift to Eſcape into
<hi>Ducall Pruſſia.</hi> But neither this nor the daily Brangles and
Skirmiſhes that happened between the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> could
hinder his Majeſty to prepare for the Field, in order to which,
he arrived <hi>Aug.</hi> 15th at <hi>Leopold,</hi> from whence the Czar and
Princes of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Czar's Travel's</note> who were got thither before, went to meet
him, as far as <hi>Rava,</hi> where they ſtaid together for ſome Days;
and after all the Demonſtrations of a Reciprocal Satisfaction,
accompanied with rich Preſents on both ſides they parted.
The Czar began his Travels laſt Year, firſt into <hi>Brandenburg</hi>
and thence into <hi>Holland</hi> to ſee his <hi>Brittanick</hi> Majeſty, for
whoſe heroick Vertues he had always profeſt a very high
Eſteem: From <hi>Holland</hi> he went for <hi>England,</hi> and having ſtaid
here moſt part of the Winter, went over for the Court of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> from whence he deſigned to go for <hi>Italy,</hi> where there
were great Preparations made (and particularly at <hi>Venice</hi>)
for his Reception; but the unhappy News of a Conſpiracy
having been formed againſt him in his own Country, made
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:62930:345"/>
him poſt thither, where he quickly brought things into good
Order, and his Armies this Year had ſome Bruſhes with the
<hi>Crim Tartars</hi> to the diſadvantage of the latter: Whatever
the matter was, 'twas obſerved he had a perfect averſion to
the <hi>French,</hi> and notwithſtanding (as was ſaid) a very kind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
from that Monarch, nothing would induce him to
go thither, which perhaps was no ſmall Mortification to that
Court: The Czar was obſerved to be wonderfully inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
eſpecially in Maritime Affairs, and very Ingenious, and
nothing but the Ignorance of the Cuſtoms, and Barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Country, could make any think him otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But to leave him, and return to his Poliſh Majeſty, at <hi>Leopold</hi> he held divers Councils of War, about the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Campaign, concerning which the Generals were
of very divided Opinions; the formal Siege of <hi>Caminiec</hi> was
the thing which the King aimed at: But while neither that,

the Enemy an Opportunity to penetrate as far as the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals

the <hi>Polanders</hi> had time to rally, and repel the Enemy who
were forced to retreat: The Fight laſted 8 Hours, and was
Bloody on both ſides; The <hi>Tartars</hi> at firſt defeated two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies

Years in vain, the Accompliſhment of this Treaty ſo So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly

Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>3. That the Magiſtrates ſhall be continu'd in their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Employments, as formerly; and the Election of new ones ſhall be made as before; they ſhall alſo enjoy the ſame
Sallaries and Emoluments.</p>
            <p>4. The Elector ſhall take the Burgeſſes into his Protection, and maintan 'em in their Privileges.</p>
            <p>5. That he ſhall alſo preſerve their Trade, and endeavour to encreaſe it, and render it more flouriſhing.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="686" facs="tcp:62930:347"/>
8. That the Traffick of the Town, with the Biſhoprick of
<hi>Ermeland</hi> and other Places, within the Territories of <hi>Poland,</hi>
ſhall remain free and open.</p>
            <p>9. That the City ſhall enjoy all the Goods and Effects which they have within the Electoral Juriſdiction; and the Adminiſtration of Juſtice ſhall continue as before.</p>
            <p>10. His Electoral Highneſs promiſes to maintain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the City; to let her have her Cannon, and her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition; not to deprive the Burghers of their Arms, not
to add any new Works to the Fortifications; nor to put any

of the Treaties.</p>
            <p>13. The City ſhall pay no farther Contributions, than ſuch as ſhall be impos'd in Dyets, by the States of Royal <hi>Pruſſia.</hi>

            <p>Theſe the Elector ratified with ſome Variation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in reſpect to the firſt Head, he conſented that the Oath which the City had taken to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity;
But in caſe of a Rupture between him and the
King, and that their City was to be attack'd, the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
was to be void, and they were to take the ſame Oath
of Fidelity to him; The Elector was alſo willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:62930:347"/>
all that he had promiſed on his part for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and Defence of the City, in caſe it were attack'd,
and to ſatisfie the Inhabitants for any Loſſes they might ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain,
by any new Fortifications he might be obliged to
raiſe for the Defence of the Place; he is farther content, that
the Preſident of the Burgomaſters ſhould have the Cuſtody
of the City-Keys and give the Word, and that the Guard
of the old Town, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be entruſted with the Soldiers,
in their Pay, except the Burgeſſes Port, and another Poſt
granted to the <hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> ſo long as the City ſhould not
be attack'd. But if otherwiſe, he would have his own Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
employ'd in all the Poſts, where there ſhould be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
for the Security and Defence of the City. The <hi>Poles</hi>
have bluſtred mightily about this Matter, and the King at
leaſt wiſe, in outward appearance, ſhewed a mighty concern
at it; So that with many of them, nothing but a War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Elector muſt ſerve: However, 'tis hoped things are
ſomewhat cooled, and that the Interpoſition of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the States General, may bring
all things again to an amicable Compoſure, either to bring
the <hi>Poles</hi> to pay the Elector his Money, or confirm <hi>Elbing</hi>
to him. I confeſs, as it fell out, I do not think <hi>Elbing</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
in the Change of Maſters, the Elector being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Prince, who is under no Obligation to diſturb her
in the Exerciſe of her Religion, and withal ſo famous for
his Prudence, Moderation, and other admirable Qualities,
that he cannot but promote the Intereſts of it; However,
I cannot, without ſome ſort of Indignation, think of that
Liberty ſome Princes have aſſumed to themſelves, of Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
or out-right Selling of Cities and their Subjects (as
Men do Horſes and Cows) and not only ſo, but many times
alſo their Religion, Lives and Properties; Tho' by what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
or humane Right, is beyond my Capacity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand:
But to leave this ungrateful Subject, and return to
<hi>Lithuania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We told you before of <hi>Oginski</hi>'s Defeat and Flight, which by the Conſequence thereof did not appear to be ſo entire as was at firſt repreſented; For he quickly recovered again,
and moſt part of the Nobility joyning in with him, he in
his turn, before the end of <hi>November,</hi> with a body of 15000
Men, fights and defeats the General <hi>Sapieha</hi>'s Army, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting

of the chief Leaders of them, and that being inferiour in
Number, they plainly ſaw the Dangers they expos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
too, if they perſiſted longer to trouble the Repoſe of
the Dutchy, and that thereupon they began to lend an Ear
to the Remonſtrances and good Offices of the Biſhop of
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:62930:348"/>
               <hi>Wilna,</hi> for the Re-union of the contending Parties; Yet ſuch
was the Obſtinacy of Prince <hi>Sapieha,</hi> that he got what Troop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
he could together, and poſted himſelf at ſome diſtance from
the City of <hi>Grodno,</hi> while the other Quartered himſelf on
the other ſide of the ſaid City, with the Nobility of the
Country and his other Adherents, who far ſurpaſſed the
Prince in Strength, and where they ſeemed to be ready to
engage, when General <hi>Fleming</hi> ſuddenly came and poſted
himſelf with 28 <hi>Saxon</hi> Companies between both Armies,
with Orders to fire upon thoſe that committed the firſt act
of Hoſtility. This he had no ſooner done, but he ſent
Orders to Prince <hi>Sapieha,</hi> in the King and Republick's Name,
to diſband his Army upon the Place; Which tho' the Prince
at firſt made a ſcruple to obey, yet conſidering the
pernicious Conſequences of a Refuſal, and the vaſt inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Force between them, his Enemy being computed to
be thrice his Strength, he reſolved to yield Obedience: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, Commiſſioners were appointed on both ſides, in

ſigned, <hi>December</hi> the 20th; Importing, That <hi>Sapieha</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which was the chief Cauſe of the Conteſt, in ſo ſevere
a Seaſon, ſhould be forthwith diſbanded, 2620 Foot ſhould
be kept ſtill in Pay, comprehending the Regiment allow'd
by the Republick; That the Officers ſhould Swear an Oath
of Fidelity, and engage never to Attempt any thing againſt
the Republick, and faithfully to ſerve the King; That the
Hungarian Troops ſhould be diſbanded, 1140 Dragoons
ſhould be kept on foot; That the Soldiers, as well diſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as otherwiſe, ſhould be promiſed free Quarters in lieu of
all their Pretenſions; That all Hoſtilities committed on both
ſides ſhould be obliterated by a General Amneſty; That
the Money which the King had promiſed the Army by the
<hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> ſhould be paid, and that the Republick
ſhould preſs the Performance of the ſaid <hi>Pacta Conventa.</hi> But
as for the four Quarters promiſed by the Republick, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
ſhould be ſent to the next Dyet, that the Money
might be paid to the Reſpective Companies; No new Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
ſhould be made without the Dyet, and that till the ſame
met, all poſſible care ſhould be taken that the General of
<hi>Lithuania</hi> might exactly obſerve the Inſtitution of the Coae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation.
And whereas ſome Palatines had hitherto refuſed
Winter Quarters, and other Contributions, Commiſſioners
ſhould be ſent to the Dyet to demand Satisfaction; That
the Right of Coaequation, Partition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of <hi>Lithuania</hi> ſhould be preſerved inviolable, and that all
Manifeſto's for that end ſhould remain in full Force, as to
that particular; But ſhould be annull'd in every thing that
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:62930:348"/>
concern'd the General of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> his Family, and other
Perſons in particular, comprehended in the ſaid Manifeſto's,
and that all poſſible ſecurity ſhould be procured for their
Perſons, Eſtates, and Dignities; That the Government of
General ſhould ſubſiſt upon the Terms of Coaequation, and
that his Penſion be reſerved to him; That for the Sum which
he promiſed to pay ſome Enſigns out of his own Money,
the ſame ſhould be taken out of what ſhould ariſe from
the four Quarters: The Artillery was to be paid out of
the Revenue of <hi>Lipiuski, Germoreski,</hi> and <hi>Winoſopski,</hi> till
the ſucceeding Dyet, of which the General of the Artillery
was to give an account to the ſucceeding Dyets at hand;
That the Artillery ſhould be laid up in the Arſenal of <hi>Wilna,</hi>
from whence it was not to be taken out, but to be employ'd
againſt the Enemies of the Republick; That Protection
ſhould be granted to the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Tartars, as well for
their Eſtates as Perſons, upon Condition that they took forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had ſettled the Succeſſion of that Crown

it muſt be in the Perſon of this young Prince by vertue
of the Seventeenth Article of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty; Which

                        <p>XI. But in Conſideration of the Tranquility of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and the Repoſe of the Subjects, it is farther agreed, That thoſe Perſons before-mention'd ſhall not ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but in Places remote from the Frontiers; and in caſe
there happen any Diſputes upon any one of the Articles of
this preſent Treaty, an equal Number of Commiſſioners ſhall
be choſen on both Sides, to determine 'em in friendly wiſe.</p>
                        <p>XII. Priſoners taken during the War ſhall be exchang'd, and if there be a greater Number of the one ſide than the other, their Imperial Majeſties ſhall extend their Clemency
towards 'em, and releaſe 'em, when they ſhall be requeſted
ſo to do, by the Embaſſadors or Miniſters reſiding in their
Courts. As for thoſe that are in the Power of particular
Perſons, they ſhall be permitted to ranſom 'em at reaſonable
Rates.</p>
                        <p>XIII. In reſpect of the Monks, and the Exerciſe of the Roman Catholick Religion, the Grand Signior promiſes to renew and confirm all Priviledges granted by his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.
Moreover, it ſhall be permitted to the Embaſſador of
of the Moſt Serene and Moſt Potent Emperor of the Romans,
to make his Complaints and Demands upon the Subject of
Religion, every time that he ſhall receive Orders from his
Maſter.</p>
                        <p>XIV. That Trade ſhall be reſettl'd between the Subjects of both Sides, according to the ancient Capitulations.</p>
                        <p>XV. That all the Conditions ſtipulated in the preceding Capitulations ſhall be religiouſly obſerv'd in every thing, not excepted in this preſent Treaty.</p>
                        <p>XVI. For the maintaining of a good Friendſhip and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repondence between the Two Empires, Embaſſadors ſhall be ſent reciprocally, which ſhall be honourably receiv'd and
treated, and they ſhall be permitted to demand whatever they
ſhall think fitting.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="698" facs="tcp:62930:353"/>
XVII. As for the Reception of the ſaid Embaſſadors, the
ſame Rules ſhall be obſerv'd for the future, which have been
obſerv'd for the time paſt, according to their Character, and
they, together with their Domeſticks, ſhall inviolably enjoy
the Law of Nations.</p>
                        <p>XVIII. This Peace, tho' concluded, according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Conditions, ſhall not have its full force, nor engage the Parties concern'd to obſerve the Laws of it, till every
thing that has been ſtipulated on both ſides, as well in regard
of the Limits as the demoliſhing of Places be entirely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</p>
                        <p>XIX. The Plenipotentiary Embaſſadors of both Empires re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally engage themſelves, and promiſe to procure the Ratification of their Maſters upon all the Conditions of this
Treaty, ſo that an Exchange thereof may be made by the
Mediators within the ſpace of 30 Days, to count from the
Day of the Signing, or ſooner if poſſible.</p>
                        <p>XX. The Term of the preſent Treaty ſhall be Five and twenty Years, to count from the Day of Signing; and at the end of that Time, both Parties ſhall be at their Liberty to
prolong it or not, as they ſhall judge moſt convenient for
their Intereſts.</p>

            <p>This being effected, there remained now no other Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation but that with <hi>Venice</hi> to be decided, which the Senate at length were brought finally to conclude on, upon the ſame
Conditions which had been long before in a manner offered
them, and which they had ſo long refuſed, to which end they
ſent their laſt Orders on the 7th of <hi>February</hi> to their Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries
to agree to the following Articles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="699" facs="tcp:62930:353"/>
1. THat the <hi>Morea,</hi> with all the Cities, Fortreſſes, Caſtles,
Lands, Villages, Mountains, Rivers, Lakes, Woods,
Ports, and generally all things elſe whatever, which ſhall be
found to be comprehended within the whole Extent of the
ſame Province, and which are now poſſeſs'd by the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhall remain in the Poſſeſſion, and under the
Dominion of the ſame Republick, including the full Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the Country inclos'd between the Sea, and the
<hi>Iſthmus,</hi> in that part where ſtill are to be ſeen ſome Remains
of the ancient Wall, ſo that there ſhall be no Extenſion made
of the Continent of the <hi>Morea</hi> into the Firm Land, beyond
the Confines of the ſame Province.</p>
            <p>2. In regard the Firm Land is under the Dominion of the High Empire, it ſhall remain entirely in the Poſſeſſion of the ſaid Empire, in the ſame Condition it was at the beginning
of the laſt War.</p>
            <p>The Fortreſs of <hi>Lepanto</hi> ſhall be evacuated by the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Caſtle, call'd <hi>Romelia,</hi> ſhall be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd on that ſide next <hi>Lepanto.</hi> The Fortreſs of <hi>Preveſa</hi> ſhall
be demoliſh'd in like manner, and the Firm Land ſhall be
left, on that ſide, in its former and entire Eſtate.</p>
            <p>3. The Iſland of <hi>Sancta Maura,</hi> with its Fortreſs, and the Head of the Bridge, call'd <hi>Peraccia,</hi> not extending any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Firm Land, ſhall remain in Poſſeſſion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Juriſdiction of the Republick of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The Evacuation of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> and the Demoliſhment of the Caſtle of <hi>Romelia</hi> and <hi>Preveſa,</hi> ſhall be perform'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Limits of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> ſhall be regulated;
and in the mean time, to prevent all manner of Hoſtilities,
as alſo to cut off all Opportunities of doing it, the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Three Places ſhall not ſtir out; they ſhall keep
within the Fortifications of thoſe Places, and ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to do any thing, upon any Pretence whatever, without
making any Incurſions upon the Firm Land. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
alſo of the ſaid Places ſhall be permitted to remain
there, or depart from thence, as they ſhall think moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
nor ſhall the leaſt Violence be offer'd to 'em.</p>
            <p>5. The free uſe of the Gulphs that lie between the Firm Land and the <hi>Morea,</hi> ſhall be in common to both Puiſſances; and both the one and the other of the Two Parties oblige
themſelves to preſerve 'em free, and to cleanſe 'em from all
manner of Pirates and miſchivous Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="700" facs="tcp:62930:354"/>
6. The Iſlands of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and thoſe Seas, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
under the Dominion of the High Empire, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they were in before the beginning of this laſt War.
No Tributes, call'd <hi>Caraches,</hi> ſhall be exacted from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Republick, nor any Contributions levy'd, nor
any other Impoſitions levy'd that have been introduced dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the preſent War.</p>
            <p>The High Empire ſhall not exact for the future, from the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> for the Iſland of <hi>Zant,</hi> or from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof, any Penſion for the time paſt, nor to
come.</p>
            <p>7. The Iſland of <hi>Egena,</hi> with its Fortreſs, lying near, and adjoining to the <hi>Morea,</hi> ſhall remain in her Poſſeſſion, in the Condition it is at preſent.</p>
            <p>8. The Fortreſs of <hi>Chonin, Sign, Ciclut</hi> and <hi>Gabella,</hi> ſeated in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> being at preſent poſſeſs'd by the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhall remain, for the future, under the Dominion of
the ſame Republick, peaceably to enjoy them. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Limits of that Province are to be ſo exactly fix'd,
and ſo clearly, that there may be no Diſpute about 'em for
the future, for the Preſervation of the Repoſe and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Subjects of both Parties, and to prevent all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
Differences that may in any manner trouble the Peace
of the Frontiers, it is concluded and agreed, That from the
Fortreſs of <hi>Chonin</hi> to that of <hi>Verlica,</hi> from <hi>Verlica</hi> to <hi>Sign,</hi> from
<hi>Sign</hi> to <hi>Duara,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Paduaria,</hi> from thence to <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goraz,</hi>
and from thence to the Fortreſs of <hi>Ciclut,</hi> and <hi>Gabella,</hi>
ſtrait Lines ſhall be drawn to make the Separation of the
Confines, ſo that between the ſaid Lines, and the Sea-Coaſt,
all the Lands and Cantons, with the Caſtles, Forts, Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and enclos'd Places, ſhall be only poſſeſs'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
aforeſaid; and as for the Lands and Cantons that
ſhall be without the ſaid Line, they ſhall remain in Poſſeſſion,
and under the Dominion of the High Empire, with all the
Caſtles, Forts, Towers, and inclos'd Places comprehended
therein; nor ſhall it be lawful to extend or leſſen the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
of their Party.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Lines ſhall be mark'd out clearly and diſtinctly, according to the Situation of the Place, by means of the Hills and Woods, or of the Rivers and running Waters; and
where the Place ſhall not evidently diſtinguiſh the ſaid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
they ſhall be mark'd out by Ditches, Stakes, and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
as the Commiſſioners appointed by both Parties to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:62930:354"/>
the Limits aforeſaid, ſhall judge convenient. And to
the end the ſaid Fortreſſes which are to remain in Poſſeſſion
of the Republick, may have ſome convenient Space of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory
before 'em, the Commiſſioners ſhall mark out about
the Fortreſſes of <hi>Chonin, Verlica, Sign, Duara, Vergoraz,</hi> and
<hi>Ciclut,</hi> ſuch a Space of Ground as may be march'd in an Hour,
in a ſtrait Line, or Semicircle, as the Ground will permit.</p>
            <p>The Fortreſs of <hi>Chonin</hi> will preſent her Flank on that ſide next <hi>Croatia,</hi> as far as the Confines of the Emperor's Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, without doing any Prejudice to the Three Potentates,
whoſe Confines ſhall join to the ſaid Limits. But they ſhall
be oblig'd inviolably to obſerve the Right which belongs to
every one of the Three Potentates, according to the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this Univerſal Peace. Both Parties ſhall be equally
bound to obſerve the ſaid Line; and if it ſhould happen, that
in the Neighbourhood of the ſaid Line, or in the Line it
ſelf, there ſhould be any Fortreſs depending upon the High
Empire, the Territory ſeated behind that Place ſhall remain
entire to the Empire, and in Front a Space of Ground taken
in the Circumference of the ſaid Line, ſhall be mark'd out
in a Circular Line, and which ſhall alſo have the Extent of an
Hour's March.</p>
            <p>As for the Fortreſs of <hi>Ciclut,</hi> there ſhall be in like manner aſſign'd it in Front the Circuit of a League, without the Line, drawing out a ſtrait Line to the Seaward; and when
the Limits ſhall be once fix'd, and the Bounds and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ſettl'd, in Manner and Form aforeſaid, they ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
obſerv'd, without the leaſt Alteration. And if any
one ſhall have the Boldneſs to violate the ſaid Bounds and
Marks of the ſaid Frontires, or to paſs beyond the ſaid Limits;
or that the Officers themſelves ſhould fail in their Duty and
Care in that particular, by puniſhing the Offenders accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Deſerts, they ſhall themſelves be ſeverely pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh'd,
on both Sides. And in caſe the Commiſſioners ſhall
meet with any Difficulties, or ſhould not agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they ſhall faithfully and exactly inform their Maſters
thereof, to the end ſuch Differences may be amicably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by the Good Offices and Interpoſition of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
his Imperial Majeſty, and the Lords Mediators at
the Ottoman Court.</p>
            <p>9. The Territory and Dependencies of the Signory of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſa</hi>
ſhall be annex'd to the Territories and Cantons of the
High Empire, and all Obſtacles that hinder the joining and
Communication of the Lands of the ſaid Signory, with the
Lands of the High Empire, ſhall be taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="702" facs="tcp:62930:355"/>
10. <hi>Caſtelnovo,</hi> and <hi>Liſano,</hi> which are in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of <hi>Cattero,</hi> being actually in the Poſſeſſion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhe ſhall remain in the peaceable Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thoſe Places and Territories. Which is likewiſe to
be underſtood of ſome other Fortreſs, whatever it be, ſeated
in that Canton, and of which the ſame Republick is in actual
Poſſeſſion. And the Commiſſioners which ſhall be choſen on
both Sides, ſhall be Perſons of known Integrity, without
Paſſion, or private Intereſt, to the end they may determine
this important Affair with all poſſible Equity, by making a
Separation of the Limits of the Country, by evident and
undeniable Marks.</p>
            <p>11. The Commiſſioners ſhall give reciprocal Notice of their meeting, and ſhall meet in a Place proper and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for their Buſineſs, with an equal Number of armed At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
Men of Peace, and not given to create Trouble;
and they ſhall begin their Conferences upon the firſt Day of
the Equinox; that is to ſay, the 14/22 of <hi>March,</hi> of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Year now running on.</p>
            <p>12. Neither Party ſhall give Sanctuary or Protection to Fugitives, on either ſide, but ſhall cauſe 'em to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and impriſon'd, that they may be brought to condign
Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>13. Both Parties ſhall be permitted to repair and fortifie the Fortreſſes in their Poſſeſſion; but not to build any new ones upon the Frontiers, not to rebuild ſuch as are demoliſh'd.
The Subjects alſo of both Parties are permitted to build Towns
and Villages in order to live in Peace, and as good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
one with another.</p>
            <p>14. As for what concerns Religion, the releaſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Slaves, and matter of Trade and Commerce, the Conditions of the laſt Treaty ſhall be obſerv'd, according to
their Form and Tenor; and the Sacred Imperial Edicts, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
granted to the Republick, are confirm'd by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Peace.</p>
            <p>15. All Hoſtilities to ceaſe from the Day of the ſigning the Treaty concluded between the High Empire, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; and for the Information of the Governours of the
Frontiers, Thirty Days are allow'd for the Provinces of <hi>Boſſina,
Albania,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and Forty for <hi>Candy,</hi> the <hi>Morca,</hi> &amp;c.
And a general Amneſty is to be allow'd to the Subjects of
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:62930:355"/>
both Parties, for any Action or Crime committed during the
War.</p>
            <p>16. The Duration of this preſent Peace ſhall be determin'd upon the Delivery of the Acts of this preſent Treaty.</p>
            <p>By theſe reſpective Treaties may be ſeen the ſeveral Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of the Confederates, from the <hi>Turk,</hi> during this long and bloody War, now fully terminated; How vaſtly
the Emperor has increaſed his Territories, no Man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands

Yet how many ſtrong Fortreſſes, and what vaſt Tracts
