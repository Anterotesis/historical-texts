            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

of your acustomed clmencie: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
at the consideration of your
excellent vertue: more confidentlie doe I present vnto
your Worship these few vntutord lines, the trauell of
my rude Mule, and vntimelie fruites of my first spring.
The ground where they grew, as it needed much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring,
and diligent tillage, euen so the Gardener to
make amendes, was none of the skilfullest, but lacked
that cunning which riper yeares and longer experience
might peraduenture haue supplyed, whereby the fruit,
which otherwise would haue bene delicate, be changed
and turned to meere wildings. Yet considering that the
stomacke ouercloyd with daintie and sweete iunkets, is
oft times very much recreated with meaner and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher
meats: So your Worship sometime wearied with
high and serious affaires, may at length vouchsafe to
cast a glaunce vpon these my vnlettered poemes, which
<pb facs="tcp:11200:3"/>
wil perhaps bring no lesser content than delectation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your graue and stayed mind, vnto whome, and vnto
whose noble predecessours, I do acknowledge me and
my weake parentes so much to bee and haue bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted,
that should the gods allot vnto the tearme of my
life, <hi>Nestors</hi> yeares, bestowe vpon me <hi>Croesus</hi> wealth,
and endue me with <hi>Tullies</hi> elequence, yet were I neunr
able with long endeuour, incessiue giftes, or finenesse
of Oratorie, to make satisfaction, requite, or set foorth
halfe that praise and dutie, which is of me, to you to be
perfourmed, for so great and so many inestimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites:
should I goe about to rehearse them, I shoulde
vndertake a matter as hard to be compassed, as is <hi>Aetna</hi>
to be remooued. These rude lines, penned at vacant
houres, partly to shun the vntolerable crime of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
partly to make known in some measure, my boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
dutie, I haue presented to your Worship, praying
you to vouchsafe them your acceptance', as <hi>Alexander</hi>
did of a cup of cold water, offered vnto him of a simple
man, which not doubting of, I hope hereafter I shall be
better able to present your Worship with some polisht

            <l>And hearing them so soundlie snorting both,</l>
            <l>Rose vp, opt doores, and priuily crept out.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11200:16"/>I caught her vp, and mounting on a horse,</l>
            <l>made no delay but hasted to the shore.</l>
            <l>But see what hapt, scarce were we on his backe,</l>
            <l>But suddenly our palfrey neighed out,</l>
            <l>Vnhappy neighing <hi>Thirsis</hi> might it call.</l>
            <l>Who wakening at the snril and sudden noise,</l>
            <l>Cald <hi>Flora,</hi> thinking robbers had been there,</l>
            <l>Vp <hi>Flora,</hi> (quoth he looke about the house,</l>
            <l>Bar fast the doores, false knaues are neere at hand.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Flora</hi> was now far ynough from him,</l>
            <l>He rising vp, ran foorthwith to her bed.</l>
            <l>And missing her, straightway he cryed out,</l>
            <l>Alas poore wretch, how shall I liue henceforth,</l>
            <l>The traytor hath my <hi>Flora</hi> stolne away,</l>
            <l>O gastfull night, wast dungeon of sinne,</l>
            <l>Concealing <hi>Chaos,</hi> hider of all vice,</l>
            <l>Nurse of ill actes, companion of woes,</l>
            <l>How couldst thou let me sleepe in carelesse bed,</l>
            <l>Whilst my sweet daughter, staffe of mine old age,</l>
            <l>Ioy of my life, prolongresse of my dayes:</l>
            <l>Is by a villaine falslie from me stolne.</l>
            <l>Ile after him, and if I may but once</l>
            <l>The traitor see, then in despight of gods,</l>
            <l>And fortune both, these age-shakt bedred lims</l>
            <l>Shal either bring my sweetest child againe.</l>
            <l>Or els I vowe vnto the highest powers,</l>
            <l>I will not stick to spend my dearest blood.</l>
            <l>This said, he tooke an horse, and desperate,</l>
            <l>Came posting after vs vnto the port:</l>
            <l>And scarce were we, vnhorst and gone aboord,</l>
            <l>But like a Tyger, when her tender ones</l>
            <l>He sees on seas, thus raged he on land,</l>
            <l>Stay periurde villaine, homicide vniust,</l>
            <l>Lust-breathing traytor, giue me my sweet child;</l>
            <l>

            <l>Come my sweet child, tis I thy father call,</l>
            <l>Ah cruell Tyger, flinty-hearted flaue,</l>
            <l>Canst thou thus murther old vnweeldy age,</l>
            <l>I fearing least these fierce outragious tearmes</l>
            <l>Should mooue the minds of people vnto ruth:</l>
            <l>Made no delay, but leaping on the shore:</l>
            <l>Caught in mine armes the swayne, an irksome loade,</l>
            <l>And caried him perforce into the ship:</l>
            <l>Not mooued with these miserable words,</l>
            <l>Ah cruell wretch, incester pittilesse,</l>
            <l>What wilt thou do? first take from me my child:</l>
            <l>Then take me from mine old and aged wife,</l>
            <l>What should I do, shal these old age shakt lims,</l>
            <l>Be tost on seas, which rather couet rest:</l>
            <l>Shall I now liue amongst some barbarous folke,</l>
            <l>And in some vicious country lay my bones,</l>
            <l>O take my daughter, take her and be gone,</l>
            <l>And let me goe vnto my wife againe,</l>
            <l>Ah my sweet <hi>Mepsa,</hi> who shall hug with thee,</l>
            <l>And what shall now betide my tender flocke,</l>
            <l>This done, the shipmen hoisted vp their sayles:</l>
            <l>Plide oares, and quickly lanched into deepe:</l>
            <l>All hope was gone, now must he needs away,</l>
            <l>Sometimes he railde, sometimes he held his peace,</l>
            <l>Poore <hi>Flora</hi> sate vpon my louing knee:</l>
            <l>And scarslie durst behold her angrie Sire:</l>
            <l>The scowling euen had thrise with dankish mysts,</l>
            <l>Obscurde the day, and brought in pitchie night:</l>
            <l>The blushing morne thrise with rose-colloured hue,</l>
            <l>Expeld the night, and brought in day againe:</l>
            <l>When cutting through the Caerule salt-sea some,</l>
            <l>With flying pines, and plowing <hi>Tethis</hi> waues,</l>
            <l>Enuious Fate, prosperities Archfoe,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11200:17"/>Minding to shew her fickle deity,</l>
            <l>That in her forehead as she dimples had,</l>
            <l>So she had also wrinckles in her front,</l>
            <l>That as she smilde, so she could also frowne,</l>
            <l>Now turnde her wheele, and wrought our endles woe</l>
            <l>Securely now between my folded armes,</l>
            <l>Held I my loue, the hauen of content:</l>
            <l>When suddenlie a stormie Orion came,</l>
            <l>Blacke hellish mystes the splendent skies obscurde,</l>
            <l>Skies taking now the shape that once they did</l>
            <l>When princelie <hi>Ioue</hi> did worke the great deluge?</l>
            <l>Winds flewe abroad burst out from craggie hils:</l>
            <l>And all <hi>Eolia</hi> then was vp in armes,</l>
            <l>Vast surges rose, death-threatning billowes rag'd,</l>
            <l>Our flying pinnesse now mounted to and fro,</l>
            <l>Now downe to <hi>Stix,</hi> now vp to heauen they went:</l>
            <l>Ay me poore wretch, thus gan I then crie out:</l>
            <l>Sin-hating powers, reformers of all vice,</l>
            <l>Abandoners of euil and cruell actes,</l>
            <l>Cease to pursue with weapons of reuenge,</l>
            <l>Mine haynous and intollerable fact.</l>
            <l>Alas my rigour to old <hi>Thirsis</hi> showne,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Floras</hi> rape do follow me by seas,</l>
            <l>If nought but death can satisfie my crime,</l>
            <l>Then take away mine vndeserued life.</l>
            <l>Spare <hi>Floras</hi> life, she hath deseru'd no death.</l>
            <l>This said, an huge tempestuous blast of wind</l>
            <l>Fraught with a mightie garison of waues,</l>
            <l>Laid so hard siege against our fortrest pine,</l>
            <l>That cables crackt, and sailes in sunder tare.</l>
            <l>Out cride the keepers, now are we vndone,</l>
            <l>Yet fully bent vnto our endlesse wracke,</l>
            <l>Fietce <hi>Adria</hi> remunified his force,</l>
            <l>A roaring cannon he againe dischargde,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11200:17"/>Which rent our ships against the craggie rockes,</l>
            <l>Then might you see an heart lamenting hap,</l>
            <l>Some hang on boords, some swimming in the deep,</l>
            <l>All labouring to saue and keep their liues:</l>
            <l>I held in armes my true and dearest loue:</l>
            <l>Thinking with her to end my lothed life:</l>
            <l>When suddenly we were by fate disioynd:</l>
            <l>I throwne by force all headlong in the seas,</l>
            <l>Yet labouring my life still to preserue:</l>
            <l>For who so wretched but desires to liue,</l>
            <l>These twinding armes caught hold vpon a boord,</l>
            <l>Which drew me to this life-preseruing rocke,</l>
            <l>And as thou didst, I found this cottage heer:</l>
            <l>Which hath been some religious house of Gods,</l>
            <l>Nought was in it, but bare and naked seats,</l>
            <l>And sea-Gods shapes, which thou doest now behold,</l>
            <l>But in this seat this instrument did lie,</l>
            <l>Which was (I thinke) <hi>Apollos</hi> Citterne once,</l>
            <l>The storme now ceast, I took it in mine hand,</l>
            <l>Descending where thy Wherrie now doth stand,</l>
            <l>There viewed I the qualified waues,</l>
            <l>And looked if some ship I could espie,</l>
            <l>Preseru'd from winds, to aide me in distresse:</l>
            <l>For here was neither nourishment nor food</l>
            <l>To saue my life: thus standing on the rocke,</l>
            <l>I with my fingers toucht these twinckling strings,</l>
            <l>No dittie fine, but yet a sound it made:</l>
            <l>The sportiue fish enchanted with the sound,</l>
            <l>Did come to me, and seemde to leape and play.</l>
            <l>And suffered me to take them in mine hand,</l>
            <l>Admiring at this rare and strange euent,</l>
            <l>I thankt the Gods which such reliefe me sent:</l>
            <l>And sith that Fortune had so cruell been,</l>
            <l>As to bereaue me of my sweetest ioy:</l>
