            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Author's
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE War that the Turks
commenced againſt the
Emperor in 1683. hath been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with ſuch remarkable
Circumſtances, that it will be
hard to find in Ages paſt any
thing more worthy of Publick
View, or more capable of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhing
Hiſtory. All the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that have hitherto been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:54820:3"/>
are defective, ſtuffed
with forged Particulars, diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Narratives and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
founded upon no better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
than that of ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from one Friend to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who diverted themſelves
at the Expence of the Truth.
Yet the Publick was eaſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon, as uſual, by thoſe
ſorts of Relations, which they
fancy contain ſomething more
Secret and Particular, than is to
be found in the Publick News-Papers.</p>
            <p>One of the moſt intollerable
of thoſe Forgeries is (in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion)
what we find in the
Story of <hi>Mahomet</hi> VI. who was
dethroned, the Abſurdities of
which, I ſhall obſerve according
as they come in my Way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54820:3"/>
'Tis true, that he who wrote
the Hiſtorical Account of the
Fall of that Ottoman Emperor,
was not on the ſpot where thoſe
Affairs were tranſacted, nor is
an Hiſtorian obliged always to
ſee what he relates. 'Tis not
for that I condemn him, but I
cannot excuſe his inſiſting upon
the Infallibility of his Memoirs,
upon which he founds his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
If he had no better for
the other Particulars of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
Misfortune than he has for
the Circumſtances of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn
of <hi>Vienna;</hi> We ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee by reading of them, how
little Credit is to be given to his
Romance.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Conſiderations prevailed
upon me to undertake this Work,
and to form the Deſign of giving
<pb facs="tcp:54820:4"/>
the Hiſtory of that famous War,
with all the Exactneſs of an
Eye-witneſs with all the Fidelity
of a diſintereſted Writer, and
without Paſſion, Qualities very
requiſite in every Hiſtorian, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in one who writes the
Hiſtory of hs own Time, in the
view of thoſe who are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Matter, and whoſe
Attention to it is no ſmall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
to that Liberty, which he
might otherwiſe be inclinable to
take.</p>
            <p>My Teſtimony and Sincerity
is ſo much more to be relied on,
becauſe I was not wanting in Care
and Exactneſs to obſerve what
paſſed in that great Event, nor
do I want Courage to ſpeak the
plain Truth without diſguiſe. The
Letters and other Pieces, I join
to my Relation, are inconteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:54820:4"/>
Proofs of it. The Reader
muſt begin with razing out his
Prejudices, and forgetting, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
the ſorry Relations that
have already been publiſhed of
that Campagne, which contain
nothing of real Truth, but the
Groſs of the Action, that is to
ſay the raiſing of the Siege, and
the Names of thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
at it.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
I conceive it will not
be amiſs to ſay ſomething how
the <hi>Poles</hi> manage their War,
which will be found at large
in the firſt Chapter. I could
have added ſome Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
concerning the League con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
at the Diet of <hi>Warſaw,</hi>
betwixt the Republick and the
Emperor, but it is not with Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
as with Military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits;
<pb facs="tcp:54820:5"/>
the latter being acted in
the view of the Publick, ſeem
to require, or at leaſt to allow
that Fame may be charged with
them: But the former demand a
reſpectful Silence, the Intereſts
and hidden Deſigns of Princes
not admitting us either to be
able or to dare to publiſh them
in the ſame manner as we do
their Exploits and Atchievments.
So that I have ſatisfied my ſelf
here with illuſtrating the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Particulars, of a Publick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
one of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
that hath fallen out in our
Days, but which may well be
ſaid to be more remarkable by
the happineſs of the Succeſs, than
by the greatneſs of it or the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of putting it in Execution.
In effect, it may be ſaid without
raſhneſs, That there were many
Blunders in the Art of War, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:54820:5"/>
on both ſides on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
as if the ſame Genius
which conceived thoſe vaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
had all of a ſudden been
deprived of Underſtanding and
Reflection to carry them on to
an iſſue. But here we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who
always ſhewed himſelf a great
Captain both in Project and
Execution, was conſtantly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Common Cauſe, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
his own Intereſt, ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
all to thoſe of the Empire,
which he ſerved without concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himſelf with the particular
Intereſts or Heats of the Miniſters
of the Court of <hi>Vienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall further add here, for
illuſtrating thoſe Preliminaries,
that the Emperor being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the Deſign of the Turks
to make a powerful Irruption
<pb facs="tcp:54820:6"/>
into <hi>Hungary,</hi> looked out for
Methods on all ſides, to guard
himſelf and prevent the Storm.
Finding it was not to be done,
by renewing of the Truce, the
very Propoſal of which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by the Port, he bethought
himſelf of having recourſe to an
Alliance with Chriſtian Princes,
Count <hi>Albert Caprara</hi> his Envoy
at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> not having been
able to ſucceed in the Treaty that
he had Order to manage with
thoſe Infidels. The Emperor
knew that the King of <hi>Poland</hi>
had a deſign to renew his War
with the Turks, which being too
much divulged, by Noiſie Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies
ſent to ſeveral Princes,
had made the Sultan haſten his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.
The Emperor knew alſo
that the Repub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ick of <hi>Poland</hi> was
making conſiderable Preparations
for the Recovery of <hi>Caminiec</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:54820:6"/>
               <hi>Podolia.</hi> Upon this he ordered
his Reſident at the Court of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to begin a Negotiation on
that Subject. After the firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſent the
Great Chancellor of the Crown
his Brother-in Law, to confer with
ſome of the Imperial Miniſters at
<hi>Breſlaw,</hi> on pretence of taking
the Waters of <hi>Hiertberg</hi> on the
Frontiers of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conference had all the
Succeſs which the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi>
could deſire. There they laid the
Foundation of that famous League,
which reached ſuch a fatal Blow to
the Ottoman Empire. The Count
<hi>de Valeſtein</hi> was in 18 Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſent by his Imperial Majeſty
in Quality of Ambaſſador to the
Diet held at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
full Powers to compleat that
Great Work. Not only the League
was concluded, but a particular
<pb facs="tcp:54820:7"/>
Treaty made by the Mediation of
the Nuncio <hi>Palavicini,</hi> in which
the King of <hi>Poland</hi> engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to march in Perſon to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> in caſe it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged,
the Grand Viſier having
actually projected it.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak nothing of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Preparations that were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
made in the Empire and
<hi>Poland,</hi> that may eaſily be judged
of by the Greatneſs of the Event,
and the Importance of the Deſign.
I ſhall only obſerve, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
made ſurprizing Efforts,
the Pope open'd his Treaſures, and
the K. of <hi>Poland</hi> his Coffers, which
no Body expected from that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
ſo as thoſe that knew him,
nay, even thoſe of his own Family
and neareſt Relations could ſcarce
believe it when they ſaw it. This in
ſome meaſure may ſerve to juſtifie
the Ambaſſadors that reſided at
<pb facs="tcp:54820:7"/>
his Court, whoſe want of <hi>penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or exactneſs</hi> was <hi>ſo much</hi> blam'd,
<hi>becauſe their Accounts were afterwards
found to differ very much from the real
poſture of Affairs.</hi> Such Contrarieties
are more ordinary at the Court of
<hi>Poland,</hi> than at any other in <hi>Europe.</hi>
There's no Point ſo difficult to
know, nor more uneaſie to manage
<hi>becauſe of the different Intereſts which
juſtle there.</hi> They have their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Negotiations, as they have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Intereſts from that of the
Kingdom in general. They abound
with <hi>Cabals, Intrigues,</hi> &amp;c. The K.
in particular <hi>has his ſeparate Maxims
and Politics.</hi> The Q. makes a ſecond
Party, <hi>which is principally made up
of her own Family, and many times ſhe
brings over the King.</hi> The Confidents
of that Princeſs have likewiſe a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Intereſt for themſelves, under
her Majeſty's Protection, and the
ſhadow of her Name; ſo that an
Ambaſſador muſt have an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb facs="tcp:54820:8"/>
Genius to negotiate with <hi>ſo many</hi>
Heads, and conciliate <hi>ſo many</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Parties, in order to bring 'em
into the Intereſt of his Prince.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if an Ambaſſador apply
himſelf too much to make Intereſt
at Court, he certainly miſcarries
with the Republic, where there are
alſo <hi>as many Heads of Parties, as
there are Senators and Miniſters,</hi> who
in General <hi>are always oppoſite to the
Intereſt and Deſigns of the King.</hi> On
the other Hand, if he endeavour <hi>to
get in with the</hi> Republic, he infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
loſes the Court, which is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable
Enemy; <hi>ſo that a Miniſter
able to manage</hi> both, <hi>is as hard to be
found as the</hi> Phaenix, of whom we
know nothing but the Name.</p>
            <p>I thought fit to inform the Reader
of thoſe Circumſtances, that he may
know the Genius of a Nation, whoſe
Exploits I am about to recount, and
<pb facs="tcp:54820:8"/>
avoid drawing Conſequences to their
Favour or Diſadvantage upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Particulars he may meet
with in this Relation. I have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obſerved two things, which the
Public hath approved in other Works.
The one is, that I have added an <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary</hi>
at the ends of the Chapters,
to ſatisfie the Curioſity of Travellers;
and the other is, that I have wrote
the Names of the <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi>
according as they are pronounced in
each <hi>Language,</hi> wherein I took the
Advice of <hi>Men</hi> that were able to

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">Containing the State of the Armies of Poland: The
different ſorts of Troops that compoſe them:
Their Pay: Their Arms: And their Manner of
Encampment and Fighting.</head>
               <p>THE Explanation of this Head is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary before we enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Relation of the Campagne of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> becauſe the Poliſh Soldiery
differs ſo much, in every thing, from that of other
Countries, that we cannot make a Judgment
of their Exploits, without knowing how they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54820:10"/>
put them in Execution. Here we are to treat of
a People different from thoſe of this Part of the
World, Men that have a diſtinct ſort of Arms, a
Diſcipline proper to themſelves, and a Method
of War peculiar to their own Nation, of which
we have form'd an extraordinary Idea, meerly
becauſe of the Turks and Tartars, who are the
Enemies they have to deal with. We muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin,
If the good Opinion conceived of them,
be well founded; and, Whether it ought to
be aſcrib'd to the Skilfulneſs of the Poles in
Matters of War, or to the Unskilfulneſs of their
Enemies.</p>
               <p>It muſt be own'd, That there's Valour to be
found amongſt the Poliſh Troops: That their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
is reſolute, and their Cavalry bold, and
manage their Horſes better with an ordinary
Snaffle, than the French and Germans do theirs
with their Bitts and Spurs, which are altogether
unknown to the Poles. But, at the ſame time, we
may truly ſay, That the Valor of the Poles is
not ſo much a Noble and Generous Courage, as a
Natural Inſenſibility of Temper, in relation to
Danger, or a Vain glorious Humour, to which they
are emboldened by their Numbers, and a brutal
Fierceneſs, acquired by a Habit of enduring the
Rigors of the Seaſon, want of Proviſions and othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Conveniencies, which is plain enough to be ſeen in
Duels, wherein the Poles ſeem to have no Senſe
of Honour, and likewiſe in Poſts of danger, which
they very willingly yield to thoſe that think them
the more honourable, becauſe more dangerous. In
Duels they always give over upon the firſt wound,
and conſtantly fight in preſence of Spectators,
who are there, as they pretend, to prevent foul
Play, but, in effect, to part the Combatants,
without ſometimes giving them leave ſo much as
to draw Blood. They don't value themſelves here
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54820:10"/>
upon thoſe nice Points of Honour, as in other
Nations. Thoſe brave Fellows arm'd Capapee,
and who ſeem to threaten the very Sky with
their fierce Looks, dare not in cold Blood attack
a vigorous French Man Hand to Hand, that
offers to look them in the Face. They go always
in Troops or keep their Blood warm with Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
on ſuch Occaſions. Yet I muſt confeſs, this
is not without Exception. I know Lords and
ſingle Gentlemen among them, who are Perſons
of an undaunted Courage, of a Noble refined
Valour of a great Capacity for Martial Affairs,
and fully inſtructed in the Art of War, which
is of no uſe nor eſteem here, becauſe they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make Sieges nor Attacks, but do all in the
Field. Beſides, the beſt concerted Deſigns that
can be, miſcarry here for want of Neceſſaries to
put them in Execution. They have neither Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers,
Artillery-Men, Utenſils nor Ammunition
ready in time. The building of a Bridge, is with
them a Work of three Months. When the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
is in the Field, the Ammunition is in the
Magazin. Their Infantry pinch'd with Hunger,
ſtarved with Cold, and overwhelmed with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
and their Cavalry lazy and void of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
are enough to fruſtrate the beſt laid deſigns
of the greateſt Generals. Among thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
this Character, we muſt reckon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin
of <hi>Ruſſia, Jablonouski</hi> a Lord of a fine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
of a Noble and VVarlike, and yet of a
ſweet Mien, he is a Perſon of undaunted Courage,
accompanied with an admirable Temper, and
great Penetration. He was firſt Grand Enſign of
the Crown, afterwards Little General, and for
his Valour advanced to the Supreme Dignity of
Grand General, after the Death of Prince <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius
Wietſnieviſtski.</hi> One of the Actions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this General ſignalized himſelf with part of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54820:11"/>
the Foreign Troops was to ſtop the fury of
Tartars, and give the King time to retire under
<hi>Leopold</hi> with the reſt of his Army. This parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
will merit the Readers pardon for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
I ſhall here make to acquaint him with
one of the greateſt Actions of the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the Palatin of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Leopold</hi> is Capital of the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the Seat of the Palatin, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
famous in the Hiſtory of the preſent Age, by
reaſon of the ſhare it hath born in the War betwixt
the Poles and the Turks: But this Action of the
King, which we are now about to relate, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
its Memory to all Poſterity, and advance
it to the higheſt Pinacle of Glory. In the laſt Year
of the Reign of <hi>Michael</hi> his Predeceſſor, this
City was in great danger. The Turks burnt its
Suburbs in 1672. and were likely to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
this Important Place, which is but ſorrily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
had not the Inhabitants come to a Treaty,
promiſed a great Summ for their Redemption, and
given up the principal Citizens as Hoſtages, who
were retained a long time in <hi>Caminiec.</hi> But
King <hi>John</hi> III. knew how to guard this City in
the Sequel of the War, by the moſt glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
imaginable. In 1675. the Tartars advanced
very near this City, which the Grand Viſier had
commanded them to beſiege. The King of <hi>Poland</hi>
encamped round the Place, and fortified the ſame
with diligence, though he had ſcarcely 5000
Men left. <hi>Ibrahim Pacha</hi> and Sultan <hi>Nuradin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Enemies Army, which conſiſted of
15000 Turks and 20000 Tartars. Theſe two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
having miſcarried before ſeveral other Places,
ſat down before <hi>Sbaracz,</hi> in which there were but
40 Heidukes and 6000 Payſants, who were more
inclined to ſurrender, than to fight, and in effect,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54820:11"/>
as ſoon as the Enemy appear'd, the Rabble open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Gates.</p>
               <p>After this Expedition <hi>Ibrahim</hi> retired to <hi>Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niec,</hi>
and <hi>Nuradin</hi> detatch'd 15000 Men to block
up <hi>Leopold,</hi> poſting himſelf with the reſt of the
Army, two Leagues higher to attend the Iſſue,
which was to his diſhonour, for the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
marched with ſome Squadrons againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
charged them with vigor, and drove them
back to <hi>Nuradin</hi>'s Camp, whence that Tartar
Prince retir'd with great Precipitation.</p>
               <p>Some time after, having aſſembled more
Troops, he renewed his deſign of inveſting <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold</hi>
and forcing the King's Camp, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
it himſelf at the Head of 40000 choſen
Men, being attended with abundance of Officers
of the beſt repute among the Tartars. He began
with the Attack of <hi>Slotzow,</hi> which is a Caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the King's Hereditary Demeſnes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ten Leagues of <hi>Leopold</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Caminiec.</hi>
This Caſtle is well enough for a Gentleman's
Houſe, and hath ſome Fortifications according to
the Modern way, faced with Stone, but of very
little Defence. The Enemy attacqued it vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
by way of Scalade with Sword in Hand.
The Palatin of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> defended it with extreme
bravery, and forced the Tartars to retire from
before this ſorry Place, after an obſtinate Fight
of five Hours duration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nuradin</hi> thinking it beſt to preſerve his Troops
that were deſigned for a more important Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
would not expoſe them to any more Aſſaults,
but continued his march towards <hi>Leopold,</hi> and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
himſelf of a vaſt Plain below the Hills, with
which the Town is ſurrounded, and upon which
the King had taken his Poſt. This Plain was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in an Inſtant with the Enemies Squadrons,
who raiſed ſuch a mighty Duſt as quickly covered
them from view. In the mean time, thoſe of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54820:12"/>
the Caſtle of <hi>Leopold</hi> fired ſome Guns to give No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to the People of the Country, to retire for
their Security behind the King's Camp. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
having viewed that of the Tartars, was nothing
diſcouraged by their prodigious Number, but gave
all neceſſary Orders for the ſafety of his Camp,
and the City in which the Queen and the Princes
her Sons were ſhut up. He poſted Guards in two
places, on the Right and Left, to prevent a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
placed his Infantry in Ambuſcade, amongſt
the Buſhes at the foot of the Hills, which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
his Camp from the Plains poſſeſſed by the
Tartars, and planted his Cannon on the Heights,
to favour the deſcent of his Squadrons, his eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to fight, having quite over-ballanced his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Numbers.</p>
               <p>They began to skirmiſh aſſoon as they could join,
and the Poliſh Horſe not finding a convenient
ground at firſt, were put into diſorder, but the
King coming to their relief with the reſt of his
Troops, and enlarging hi Front inſenſibly, as his
Squadrons gain'd gtound, he reſtored the Battle,
where his preſence ſeconded by his Example, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
his own Men with as much Valour, as it
did his Enemies with terror. The Sultan quickly
perceived by the diſorder of his Troops, that he
was defeated by a Superior Power. The King of
<hi>Poland</hi>'s Hand became dreadful to them, by the
weight of its blows, and every one ſtriving to
avoid them, that prodigious Army vaniſhed in an
inſtant like a Phantome.</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed this Digreſſion, I return to my
Subject.</p>
               <p>The Palatin of <hi>Kiow,</hi> General of the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
is owned by all Men, to be one of the
braveſt Officers and wiſeſt Generals at this time in
<hi>Poland,</hi> and hath acquired an univerſal Eſteem
by his Gallant and Prudent Actions. Thoſe who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54820:12"/>
have ſeen him in Battle could not but be charmed
to behold his Magnanimity in expoſing himſelf,
and taking care to ſave his Men. Thoſe who
have heard him diſcourſe of Martial Affairs are
perſwaded, that were he in a Country, where
the Art Military is regularly cultivated, he would
be accounted one of the greateſt Captains in
<hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is moreover in <hi>Poland</hi> another Perſon of
extrordinary Merit in that kind, namely Prince
<hi>Lubomirski,</hi> who is no leſs expert in War than
the Palatin, and exceeds him much in Temper
and Preſence of Mind, which contribute ſo much
to the winning of Battles: ſo that the ſame para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
might be made betwixt thoſe two Poliſh Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
that was made betwixt the Prince of
<hi>Condé</hi> and the Mareſchal <hi>Turenne,</hi> the one was
incomparable for managing a Campagne, and the
other for fighting a Battle.</p>
               <p>I would not that others, whoſe Names and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Endowments I don't mention here, ſhould
ſuffer by my ſilence. I ſhall do them Juſtice elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
but I thought fit to mention thoſe Great
Men here, whoſe Reputation is generally known,
that I might give the Reader an Idea of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Bravery, of which thoſe Gentlemen are the
Model, as well as the Honour of that Nation. I
don't pretend to rank the King of <hi>Poland</hi> with his
Generals, becauſe he is beyond Compariſon, and
above all Encomiums and Titles, but we may
without flattery adventure to call him <hi>the Hero of
the North.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Republic hath two ſeparate Armies, under
two different Generals, who are not ſubordinate
nor dependant on one another. They encamp ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately,
and act in the ſame manner as Troops
of different Countries. When they are obliged to
join in Day of Battle, each General iſſues his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54820:13"/>
according to the Meaſures agreed on in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
the one receiving none from the other, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to Command, nor yet as to the Word
given to the Troops.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt of thoſe Armies is that of the Crown,
or more properly that of the Kingdom of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
The 2d is that of the Grand Dutchy of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania,</hi>
being an Auxilliary State and Allie to
the other, and not a ſubjected Province, like
thoſe who compoſe the Kingdom. That of the
Crown is to conſiſt of 36000 Men, and that of
<hi>Lithuania</hi> of 12000. Nor have they in our Days
raiſed any greater Army on any Expedition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
But as that Number is never compleat,
the Army is ſometimes greater, ſometimes leſſer,
according to the Efforts the Republick thinks fit to
make, as the Caſe requires, without ever amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to that Number of 48000, fixed by the
State of the War, which the Poles call <hi>Kompout</hi>
or <hi>Komport.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Each Army hath a Great and Little General, the
former is call'd <hi>General</hi> by way of Eminence, or
General of the Crown; the latter is called <hi>Little
General,</hi> or General of the Campagne. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp
the one on the Right and the other on the
Left of the Line. They have both the ſame Badge
of Command, <hi>viz.</hi> a Great Lance, adorned at the
end either with Feathers, or Knots of Ribbons, or
ſome other ſort of Plume, under a great Ball of
ſome rich Stuff: This the Poles call <hi>Bontchouk</hi> or
<hi>Bunczuk.</hi> It is carried by a Man on Horſeback be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the two Generals, and by its height diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
their Poſts at a great diſtance, either on a
March or in Battle. The King hath one of the
ſame ſort, with a Plume either of Herons or Eagles
Feathers or Knots of Ribbons. But when he is at
the Head of the Army, his is only carried aloft,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54820:13"/>
and thoſe of the Generals along by the Horſes
Neck, in token of their Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>The Generals have likewiſe a Batoon of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
which is given them by the King, together
with their Office, as is done to the Mareſchals
of <hi>France;</hi> It is a Mace of Arms very ſhort, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a great Ball at one end, either of Silver
or Vermillion gilt, ſometimes adorned with Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.
This Batoon is called <hi>Boulaf</hi> or <hi>Bulawa,</hi> is
ſeldom carried, but only repreſented in their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
to denote their Charge, as is done in the
Pictures of the Mareſchals of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are not Senators by their Office, their
Prerogative reaching no further than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Armies; but as they are uſually very
Conſiderable by their Birth and Merit, the King
makes them always Palatins or Caſtellans, by
Vertue of which they take Place in the Senate,
according to the Rank of their Province, without
any particular Preheminence. In the Army their
Power is without Reſtriction, their Authority
Sovereign, and their Tribunal, or Council of
War, Independent on the King. A Great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
has power of Life and Death, puts in and puts
out as he pleaſes, ſettles Winter Quarters, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
Marches, aſſembles the Army, and appoints
the Time and Place of Rendevouz as he thinks
fit, without receiving Orders from, or being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to any other than the Republick, met in
a General Diet. He appoints what Provinces ſhall
pay the Troops, and changes them at pleaſure.
'Tis true, that in the Council held by the King,
with the Senators and Generals, before the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Campagne, the Expeditions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
are concerted, but the executive Power is
in the Hands of the Great General, who acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own Mind and Intereſt, and as the
Conjunctures require.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54820:14"/>
The Grand General hath an Allowance of
60000 Francs at 10 Sous <hi>per</hi> Franc, the Poliſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
being leſs in value than that of <hi>France,</hi> by one
half; and the Little General hath 40000 Francs.
Thoſe Salleries are raiſed upon the Staroſties, the
Royal Demeſnes and the Lands of the Church,
the Caſh of which is carried to <hi>Leopold</hi> about
<hi>Michaelmaſs,</hi> that being ſuppoſed to be the end
of the Campagne. The Grand General preſides
at this Aſſembly, where he diſtributes Rewards and
Gratifications to the Army, according to Merit, and
the Neceſſity of the Officers and Gens d'Arms. The
Marches and Quarters of Aſſemblies in <hi>Poland,</hi>
do equally ruine the Country, and enrich the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
and are ordered by the Grand General, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to pleaſure. And as there is neither Inn
nor Road ſpecified, the Commander of a Troop
leads it where he pleaſes, and lives upon the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
at Diſcretion; ſo that he provides himſelf
for the Campagn as he marches, and needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Carriages and a Purſe. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
an Officer on his way from <hi>Warſaw</hi> to <hi>Leopold,</hi>
that is to ſay, about 50 Leagues, (f he go on ſtraight)
will go on the Left, and the Right to all the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
out of the Road, make the Tour of the whole
Kingdom, if he pleaſes, and will ſpend two or three
Months, ſqueezing and eating up the Peaſants at
diſcretion, by Vertue of a meer Order from the
General to go to ſuch a Place: And provided
indeed he come at the time appointed, there's no
enquiry made, what way he takes, or how much
time he ſpends in his Journey. Thus the Officer
enriches himſelf in his March, or more properly
ſpeaking, <hi>pillages at Diſcretion.</hi> I have known
thoſe who in a Journey have gathered together 5
or 6000 Francs, without reckoning Proviſions.
'Tis true indeed, there's no quartering upon Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens
Lands, or if they do, they muſt be forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54820:14"/>
to pay for it, otherwiſe the Gentry would make
a terrible Noiſe at the Diet; ſo that it's only
thro' the King's Lands, and thoſe of the Church,
that the Troops can march, that is to ſay thro'
the Villages of the Staroſties, Abbies, Biſhopricks
and ſuch like, which they force to contribute alſo
to the other Charges of the War; on which I
cannot but take Notice of the odneſs of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the Poles, who extend their Devotion
even to Hypocriſie, and yet dont exempt the
Lands of the Church from Military Exactions,
but on the contrary, expoſe them the moſt of any
to the fury of the Soldiers and the rigour of
Taxes.</p>
               <p>Formerly thoſe Marches were more vexatious
than at preſent, being more frequently allowed to
Friends and Officers of the Grand General, by
way of Gratification, but now they are never
granted, except in caſe of neceſſity, and the Grand
General does all he can to preſerve good Order and
Moderation in this Matter, yet he cannot totally
prevent the Oppreſſion of the Country, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
more by one march of the Poliſh Troops, than
by an Irruption of the Enemies, (Burning, Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and Rapes excepted) eſpecially in thoſe Parts
that fall to the ſhare of the Lithuanian Army,
which is more to be feared than the Tartars. This
is the True Cauſe of the extreme Poverty of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and of the inconceivable Deſolation of the
Kingdom, which is ſo much waſted ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Campagne of <hi>Vienna,</hi> that it does
not look like the ſame Country.</p>
               <p>The Grand General ſettles the Winter Quarters
in the ſame manner, alſo their Places of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
at the end of the Campagne, cantons the
Regiments as he thinks fit, in the Staroſties and
Lands of the Church, and oppreſſes or eaſes
whom he pleaſes. By this means a Grand General
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54820:15"/>
of the Crown called <hi>Konietſpolski,</hi> purchaſed
immenſe Riches for his Family. He obliged the
Gentry to ſell him ſuch Staroſties as lay conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for him, and conſtrained thoſe that were
unwilling to part with them by oppreſſive Winter-Quarters.</p>
               <p>At preſent this Tyrannical Power of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is much leſſened, not only becauſe the King
when he had that Charge, diveſted himſelf of
that Prerogative in order to deliver the Nobility
from the bad Deſigns of thoſe that might ſucceed
him, but alſo becauſe the preſent Grand General
makes uſe of his Power with all poſſible Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and beſides, the Lords, the King himſelf
and the Queen demand their proper Regiments
to be quartered on their own Lands, where they
oblige them to live orderly without ruining the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.
This Priviledge the preſent Crown General
denies to no Man, except he be obligd by Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to guard the Frontiers, in which caſe he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes
them indifferently, in the moſt Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Places, be they the Royal Demeſnes, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
Demeſnes or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides thoſe two Generals, each Army hath
an Officer, that commands a detached Body, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Vant-guard,</hi> which encamps at the Head of
the Whole, about half a League before the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and is compoſed of Dragoons, Infantry and
Light-Horſe to the Number of 11 or 1200. The
firſt Officer is called the <hi>Stragenick of the Crown,</hi>
and the ſecond the <hi>Stragenick of the Army.</hi> Their
Charges are different, the one being properly only
for the Nobility on Horſeback, when the <hi>Poſtpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita</hi>
is called out; the other particularly for the
regular Troops; and the latter refuſes to yield to
the other either in Command or Precedency, which
Controverſie ſtill remains undecided, the Stragenik
of the Crown maintaining his Poſt, even in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54820:15"/>
Army at preſent, being a Man of Quality and
Senator.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Obogenick</hi> is the ſame with the Quarter-maſter
of the Armies, and their <hi>Piſſar</hi> anſwers
to the Commiſſary General, who reviews the
Troops at the beginning and end of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,
and it's according to his Account that the
Regiments are paid at the Tribunal, eſtabliſhed
by the General Diet for this end in the City of
<hi>Radom</hi> in <hi>Great Poland.</hi> As to the <hi>Korongy</hi> or
Standard-bearer of the Crown, he has no Function
in the Army, but only in the Arrear-ban called
the <hi>Poſtpolita Ruſſenia,</hi> or the Nobility on their
March.</p>
               <p>The Army of the Crown, and that of <hi>Lithu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ania</hi>
is ſubdivided into two Bodies, the one all Horſe
and Natives, diſtributed into free Companies,
like thoſe of the French Gens d'Arms; this they
call the Poliſh Army. It comprehends two thirds,
that is to ſay 24000 Horſe: The other Body
conſiſts of Infantry, Dragoons and Light Horſe.
This they call the <hi>Foreign Army,</hi> becauſe in effect
it is according to the Foreign Model, cloathed
and armed after the German faſhion, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by General Majors, which are like our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchals
de Camp, divided into Regiments, and
not into Companies. This makes the other third
of the <hi>Kompout,</hi> that is to ſay, twelve thouſand
Men.</p>
               <p>Thoſe two Bodies march and encamp a-part, or
more properly ſpeaking, they compoſe the two
Lines of the Army. The firſt is all Foot and
Dragoons with the Artillery in the Center. The
ſecond is compoſed of Poliſh Horſe, or Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Companies: And 'tis at the Head of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Line, that the two Generals take their Poſt,
the one on the Right, and the other on the
Left, as I have ſaid already. The King himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camps
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54820:16"/>
in this quarter, when he is in the Army,
together with the Senators that accompany him
thither, the firſt Line being under the Command
of General Majors, and the General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
amongſt whom there is a Subordination
of Antiquity and Office.</p>
               <p>The Poliſh Army then, conſiſts all of Horſe,
divided into Troops, commanded by the greateſt
Lords, beginning with the King and the Princes
his Sons. Thoſe Troops are of different Sorts
and Qualities, ſome of them real Gens d'Arms,
others Light-Horſe. The Gens d'Arms are again
divided into <hi>Huſſars</hi> and <hi>Pancernes,</hi> and ſome
add <hi>Peteores,</hi> of whom there are more in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuanian
Army than in that of the Crown. Theſe
Gens d'Arms are all Gentlemen, eſpecially the
<hi>Huſſars,</hi> and are honoured by the King and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
with the Name of <hi>Touariches,</hi> that is to ſay,
Comrades or Companions: They admit them to
their Table, are reſpected in their particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and moſt of them Penſioners of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
and great Lords, whom they accompany to the
Diets to do them honour. Nay, I have ſeen the
Referendary of the Crown, a Man of a 100000
Livres Rent in Staroſty's, account it his honour
to have the Title and Pay of a <hi>Huſſar.</hi> The Light-Horſe
are Troops of Poles, Coſſacks, Vallachians
or German Troopers. The Army of <hi>Lithuania</hi> is
compoſed in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Huſſars</hi> are the firſt Gens d'Arms of the
Kingdom, as the Corps du Guard are in <hi>France,</hi> and
without Contradiction the fineſt Cavalry in <hi>Europe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
in reſpect of the Mein of the Men, the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Horſes, and their Magnificent and
Noble Apparel. Their Name is <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and
common to all the Cavalry of that Country, but
in its proper Signification it ſignifies <hi>Brave,</hi> for 'tis
ſuppoſed, that the Touariches ought to be ſo by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54820:16"/>
way of Eminence. In <hi>France</hi> we ſuppoſe, that the
Hungarian Cavalry was called <hi>Huſſars</hi> from their
Cry of War in time of Battle, where 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
they cry, <hi>Houſſa! Houſſa!</hi> as we ſay, <hi>Tue!
Tue!</hi> kill, kill; and the Turks cry, <hi>Alla! alla!</hi>
But this Etymology is unknown in <hi>Poland,</hi> where
they animate one another by crying <hi>Bi-zabi: i.e.
Strike, ſtrike him to death.</hi> The <hi>Huſſars</hi> never keep
Guard, don't go out on any Parties, Con-voys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and much leſs in the Strageniks Detachments. They
are reſerved only for Battles and other diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
Actions. But the preſent Grand General be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcontented with this ſort of Gens d'Arms, who
are become more effeminate and leſs valiant than
formerly he began in the Campagne of 1689. to
take away their Lances to arm them with Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons,
and to make them ſerve like ordinary
Troopers on Convoys, Vantguards and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
of the Camp without diſtinction, a certain
evidence that thoſe Troops are much degenerated
from their Ancient Splendor, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſe they would never
have endured it.</p>
               <p>They are compoſed of handſom Men, mounted
on the fineſt Horſes of the Kingdom, with divers
other Led-Horſes, richly cappariſoned, their Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
adorn'd with Plates and Nails of Silver or
Vermillion gilt, embroidered Saddles with gilt
Boys, great hanging Houzes, according to the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
Manner, with Fringes of Gold and Silver:
A Falchon or very rich Sword fixed to the left-ſide
of the Saddle under the Horſeman's Thigh. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
the Poliſh Cavalry had no Piſtols, but now
they are uſed amongſt thoſe fixed Troops. But
the Vallachians, Coſſacks, and even abundance of
Poles, have none at the Saddle Boys, no more
than the Turks, but carry one or ſometimes two
at their Girdle behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54820:17"/>
The Equipage of the <hi>Huſſars</hi> is as much diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
as their perſonal Habit. They have two or
three Waggons, a great number of Servants, and
fine Tents, ſo that a Troop of them takes up a great
deal of Ground in the Camp, becauſe the Streets
muſt be large for their Equipage, which is placed
in the Intervals, and not in the Rear, as in <hi>France</hi> and
Elſewhere. The <hi>Huſſars</hi> are armed with Back and
Breaſt, a ſcaled Head-Piece adorn'd on the ſides, and
be hind with Pendants of Iron Plates quilted, which
come down to their Shoulders, where they have
another ſeparate Piece of Armour, with Braces
reaching over their Neck to which there is fixed
a ſort of a Gantlet of Mail, which covers the
back of the hand only, the Poles not knowing the
Uſe of Gloves, nay, not ſo much as on Horſeback.
Over all this they wear a great Leopard or Tigre's
Skin, in form of a looſe Coat made in a Warlike
Faſhion, which is a very fine Ornament to the
Gens d'Arms. The Lances they carry are no leſs
Ornamental to the Body of the Troops in general:
they are longer than the French great Pikes, round,
pointed with Iron, made of a light Wood; the
upper part adorn'd with a Streamer of Taffata, in
form of a Standard, and three or four Ells in
length, painted and gilt from one end to the other.
They carry 'em in a Boot fixed in the Saddle, which
ſupports 'em alſo when they make uſe of them in
Battle, otherwiſe there were no making uſe of this
Machine, becauſe of its Weight. Nor is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of it, ſo terrible as was imagined. I have
ſeen thoſe Huſſars in Action, and likewiſe at
muſter in the Camp, and always found they had
a great deal of Trouble in making uſe of their
Lance, and that their Impetuoſity is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
when particularly enquired into. 'Tis
true indeed, that they never retire, they ride at
full ſpeed, as if they were running at the Ring,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54820:17"/>
ſo that they break through all that oppoſe them.
In the Battle of <hi>Prag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> on the <hi>Wefil,</hi> near <hi>Warſaw,</hi>
where King <hi>Caſimir</hi> attack'd <hi>Charles Guſtavus,</hi>
King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who was ſhut up between two
Rivers with a handful of Men: There was a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of <hi>Huſſars</hi> that broke through the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Line, as far as the Body of Reſerve, but they
could not return, and ſo were encompaſſed. That's
the danger this ſort of Cavalry is liable to by the
weight of their Arms, and the difficulty they have
to manage their Horſes by Snaffles, without Bitts,
when their Mouths are heated. If they had to do
with the <hi>French,</hi> who are expert in their Motions
and Countermarches, they would not kill one Man,
nor could one of themſelves eſcape: There were
no more to do, but to open the Ranks, as the
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> did, and to mix Platoons of Foot in
the Intervals of the Squadrons, to fire upon them
as they paſs; for if you kill the Horſe, you put
the <hi>Gens d' Arms</hi> out of a capacity to fight; it
being impoſſible for them to raiſe themſelves again,
becauſe of the weight of Iron upon them: So that
this ſort of <hi>Gens d' Arms</hi> is meerly <hi>in terrorem,</hi>
as <hi>Lowis le Grand</hi> judg'd at firſt ſight of them.
The Marquis <hi>de Bethune</hi> had Orders, upon his firſt
Journey into <hi>Poland,</hi> to bring home a <hi>Huſſar</hi> with
all his Accoutrements, to ſee if the Effect anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Reputation: The King being minded to have
of that ſort of Foreign Troops, the thing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
at firſt, becauſe of its Novelty and their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page;
but the Experiment made of them in the
Court of the Caſtle at St. <hi>Germans,</hi> at a Courſe
of the Lance, convinc'd His Majeſty that they
were of ſmall uſe, and could do but little damage;
and beſides they muſt have a ground on purpoſe
for them, <hi>i.e.</hi> Open Plains, like thoſe of Champagn,
to be drawn up in. If after breaking their Lance,
as they do at the firſt ſhock, they took their Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54820:18"/>
in hand, their Charge would be more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
for then they would break thro' all that
ſtood in their Way. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> hath
remedied this Inconvenience in the laſt Wars, by
flanking a Squadron of Huſſars, with two others
of Pancerns, armed with Falchons and Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons,
who join cloſe after the other are put in
diſorder, and poſſeſs themſelves of their ground
to compleat the defeat of the Enemy, whoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is already broke by the Charge of the Lances.</p>
               <p>The Huſſars have each two Servants arm'd, and
in pay, who are called <hi>Pacolets;</hi> they are mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much like their Maſters, armed with Head-Pieces
and Lances, but without Back and Breaſt,
and Leopards Skin; inſtead of which they have
the Skin of a White Wolf made like a Coat; and
behind their back a very great Wing made of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
Feathers, which gives them a fierce and ſavage
Mein: Formerly they had two Wings; and we ſee
them painted ſo in Pictures of old Wars. I am
of opinion that they are very uſeleſs, but the
Poles pretend that the whiſtling they make in the
Air terrifies the Enemy's Horſes, and helps to
break their Ranks. They left off one of them by
degrees, and it's hoped that the Great General,
who hath lately eaſed 'em of their Lances, will
likewiſe take away this Accoutrement, which is
good for nothing but to frighten little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Troops form themſelves into Squadrons,
like ours, three Men deep, and ſeventy in Front,
more or leſs, according to the number of the Gens
d' Arms and <hi>Pacolets;</hi> for every Huſſar may have
three but no more. The firſt Rank conſiſts all of
Maſters, the other two of <hi>Pacolets:</hi> And when a
Huſſar has the Guard of the Standard, he fixes
his Lance by it, and hangs the Wings of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
round it, according to their number, for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54820:18"/>
ſome have three, and others but one, and they
are paid in proportion.</p>
               <p>As thoſe Companies are very expenſive, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
entertains but few of them, and give them
little enough Pay; but the Lords who have them,
make this up by an augmentation of Pay, as a
ſort of Penſion; and thus they make themſelves
Creatures of the Touarizes, and of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
that command them, who are always Men
of Note, and fit for Service, to whom they give
at leaſt a Penſion of 6000 Francs to bear their
charge, becauſe thoſe Officers are oblig'd to keep
a Table in the Army. The Captain Lieutenant of
the King's Huſſars, called <hi>Polanoski,</hi> was one of
the Candidates for the Crown when <hi>Caſimir</hi> abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated;
by which the Reader may underſtand that
thoſe Places are fill'd with Perſons of Merit and
Quality.</p>
               <p>The King hath a Company of thoſe Gens
d' Arms; Prince <hi>James</hi> and Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> have
likewiſe each of them one; the Chief Senators,
the Biſhops and Miniſters of State, who will be
at the expence of it, have the ſame: They coſt
the Captain above 25000 Francs, beſides the Pay
of the Commonwealth. The King makes them a
compenſation for this Expence, by giving them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Foot or Dragoons in the Foreign Army,
which coſt them little, and bring in a great deal,
as I ſhall ſhew afterwards. The Standard of thoſe
Companies is very high, and almoſt as large as
that of a Company of Foot. The Lance has a
gilt wooden Ball upon the upper end, like that on
the Stern of a Ship. The Drums and Trumpets are
plac'd round the Standard, in March as well
as in Battle: For other things the Order is
much the ſame as ours, only their Trumpets ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
found any Charge, or point of War, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a <hi>Fanfare</hi> even when on a March. They
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54820:19"/>
have this peculiar in their way of Encampment,
that the Officers are always at the Head of the
Company, not far from the Standard, and all the
Baggage in the Streets or Intervals, which is the
ſame in all the other Troops of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of Gens d' Arms is the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes,</hi>
who are ſomewhat inferior to the Huſſars,
but much higher than all the reſt of the Cavalry.
They are called ſo from their Armour, which is a
Coat of Mail, in the Poliſh Tongue <hi>Pancernick,</hi>
with an Iron Cap, encompaſſed with a Net-work
of the ſame, which covers all to their Shoulders,
and ſhewing only half the Viſage, makes them
look like Satyrs, becauſe of the great Muſtaches
ordinarily worn by the Poles. Thoſe <hi>Pancernes</hi>
are arm'd with Falchons and Muſquetoons, like
Light Horſe, as well mounted as the Huſſars, but
not ſo richly equipped: They are upon all Guards
that require fatigue, are form'd into Squadrons as
the others, with a Standard of the ſame form,
their Drums are alſo the ſame; but in lieu of a
Trumpet they have a certain little Inſtrument of
Copper, not much bigger than a Flagelet, crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and hollow like a Cornet, which makes the
ſhrilleſt and moſt Savage Noiſe imaginable. It
is ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Ltuus</hi> of the Ancients.
Thoſe Companies have leſs Pay than the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars,
but are on the ſame footing as to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who make up the two laſt Ranks, and are
alſo called <hi>Pacolets.</hi> They paſs however for Light
Horſe, that is to ſay, Lightly Armed, for in other
reſpects they are true Gens d' Arms by their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and commanded by Lords; the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and the Princes having each of 'em a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in the two Armies.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe two ſorts, there's a third in the
Great Dutchy of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> armed like the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes,
and having Lances as the Huſſars, but not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54820:19"/>
quite ſo long; nor are their Streamers ſo large;
and from this difference they have different
Names: Thoſe of the Huſſars are called <hi>Kopies,</hi>
from the Latine word <hi>Copia, Forces;</hi> and thoſe of
the other are call'd <hi>Gides,</hi> which is a Word in uſe
in that Country, and alſo amongſt the Turks, as
is likewiſe that ſort of Lance. I ſaw only four
Companies of them in the Lithuanian Army, that
of the Crown having almoſt none of 'em; but
there's nothing finer than thoſe I ſaw in that
Dutchy, the Huſſars not being more magnificent in
either of the Armies. At preſent they have left
off their <hi>Gides,</hi> and are upon the ſame footing
with the <hi>Pancernes;</hi> they are call'd <hi>Peteores,</hi> and
are likewiſe honoured with the Quality of <hi>Toua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reſt of the Poliſh Army conſiſts of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Valachians, Coſſacks and Poles, armed like
our Light Horſe, with Muſquetoons and Falchons,
but not ſo uniform either in Horſe or Habit.
Their Standards, March, Drums, and way of
drawing up, agree with the ordinary Cuſtom of
the Country. It is this ſort that go out on Parties,
guard the Camp, and are made uſe of for Guards
and Convoys. I have ſeen Companies of Tartars
amongſt theſe, and formerly the Republic had
abundance of that Nation in Pay in their Wars
againſt the Muſcovites. The King of <hi>Poland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he went to the Relief of <hi>Vienna,</hi> had a
mind to try the Pulſe of the Officers of thoſe who
continued ſtill in his Service, and all of them
promiſed him an in violable Fidelity, not only
in fighting againſt the Turks, but alſo againſt the
Tartars, offering to leave in <hi>Poland</hi> one half of
their Number as Hoſtages for the Loyalty of
the other, who ſhould follow his Majeſty; for
he had offer'd to give all of them their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
which they would not accept of, but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54820:20"/>
in that Expedition with extraordinary fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>That which they call the Foreign Army, hath
quite another ſort of Diſcipline, they are Regiments
of Foot and Dragoons, Cloth'd and Arm'd as thoſe
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> with this difference, that
the Dragoons are mounted on ſorry Jades, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
equipped, almoſt naked, and all of them in
different Colours. The Infantry is of all things
the moſt pitiful, and more tatter'd than any Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
or Italians that ever we heard of; ſome of
them have Caps, others Hats; ſome have Cloaks,
others none: They are all without Swords, but
carry long Battle-Axes faſhioned like thoſe that
were carried before the Roman Conſuls. Thoſe I
always took to be of admirable uſe. The Poles
carry them faſtened to their ſhoulders by a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Thong, they ſerve them inſtead of Reſts for
their Muſquets; and there's nothing in the World
comparable to them for covering a Battalion, and
defending them againſt Horſe. Thoſe miſerable
Fellows, all in Rags, as I have ſaid, and more
like Scullions than Soldiers, ſome of them with
Cloaks, and others of them with a ſort of Gowns
of a ſcandalous diverſity, are nevertheleſs incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſtout, which in reaſonable Men I ſhould call
Bravery. They reſiſt all ſorts of Inconveniencies,
Nakedneſs, Hunger and Blows with an Heroic
conſtancy; bear all the burden of the War, and
undergo all the dangers of it, inſomuch that I
have ſeen this Infantry form the Arreir-guard in a
Plain, in dangerous Retreats, when the Tartars
purſued the Camp cloſe, to cover the Poliſh Gens
d' Arms, who retir'd before them without any
ſcruple; I have ſeen thoſe Soldiers, dying with
Hunger, and quite tir'd out, lie upon the ground
charging their Muſquets, which they were ſcarce
able to carry, and yet would keep firing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54820:20"/>
This Infantry don't indeed pride themſelves
in their Miſery, which is ſo diſproportionable to
the ſplendor of the Gens d' Arms, but it's they
that do the ſervice, and are the ſafety of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
whereof the others are meerly the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Tho' this Army be called Foreign, it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
compos'd of native Poles, with Officers of
a Foreign Name and Model, Colonels, Lieutenant
Colonels, General Majors and others. People of
all Nations may be employed in this Army,
whereas the Poles only are admitted into the Free
Companies. There are Germans, Curlanders,
French and others in the Foreign Army. The
King, Queen, Princes, Generals and other Lords,
have Regiments therein of both ſorts. The Foot
and Horſe Guards, that attend the King's Perſon,
are comprehended in this Body of the Army, as
are abundance of other Free Companies of Horſe,
Dragoons and Heidukes, which the Generals have
rais'd for their particular ſervice, and make the
Republic pay for them. Upon which I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
by the way, that there are Royal Lands in
<hi>Poland,</hi> which we call <hi>Fiefs</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> given to
Lords, and their Deſcendants as Hereditary Eſtates,
on condition of maintaining a certain number of
Troops; whereof there are ſome that are obliged
to furniſh an hundred Dragoons: but the Court
does not keep thoſe Lords to an exact performance;
tho' if they would oblige the Poſſeſſors of thoſe
Lands to it, the Republic ſhould have in caſe of
need near twenty thouſand Men that coſt them
nothing.</p>
               <p>This is the diſpoſition of the Poliſh Armies,
with which that Nation hath formerly made their
Neighbours to tremble, ev'n thoſe who now keep
them under the Yoke; of which one eſſential
Reaſon is, not ſo much the want of Courage, tho'
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54820:21"/>
the Poles be in that very reſpect much degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from their Anceſtors, as the want of Mony
and Diſcipline, which hinders the compleating of
their Troops, prevents their arrival at the place of
their Rendeſvouz againſt the time appointed, and
overwhelms them with miſery. As to their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
that is ſtill more irregular than their Pay,
there being nothing of any exact ſervice perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here. I never ſaw in the Army neither main
nor ordinary Guard, nor Convoy for their Forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
their Troops going to ſleep upon the moral
ſecurity they conceive themſelves to be in from the
ſtupidity of their Enemies. Had they to do with
French or Germans, not one Forrager ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Camp; nor could there paſs a Night
without beating up one quarter or other. There's
nothing but the Body commanded by the <hi>Stragenik,</hi>
compos'd of all ſorts of Troops, and amongſt
them Pancernes and Poliſh Cavalry, which makes
a ſort of advanc'd Guard for all the Army in
general, encamping at their Head, about half a
League from the firſt Line, and the ſame is rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
proportionable to the danger. Beſides this
Detachment, each Regiment of Infantry makes
one of twenty or twenty five Men, poſted about
thirty paces before the Line, for the Guard of the
Colours, which are planted all together at the
Head of the Colonel's Company. They do more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
beſides this, when they are in the open Field,
and in preſence of the Enemy, incloſe their Camp
with an Entrenchment of Waggons, which they
call the Tabor, and is certainly an Extraordinary
Rampart againſt the Tartars. This Tabor marches
in order of Battle with the Army, without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Every Officer makes ſuch an Entrenchment
round his Tents. The number of Carriages is
twice as great as the number of the Men; and a
Camp ſo entrench'd hath ſomething that is great,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54820:21"/>
ſingular and formidable in it. In cover'd or une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ground, they make uſe of <hi>Chevaux de Frize,</hi>
each Regiment hath a certain number of them,
they are fixed to four Wheels like a Waggon, and
on a March are drawn by Horſes. This is none of
the worſt Inventions, and is owing to a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
call'd <hi>Hoccart,</hi> who is Ingineer to the King
of <hi>Poland,</hi> and hath ſerv'd him for fifteen years
with applauſe.</p>
               <p>The Poles have a particular way of Encamping,
<hi>viz.</hi> in a very large Square, inclos'd on all ſides;
the firſt Line conſiſts of all the Infantry, with the
Artillery in the Center, the Dragoons on the Wings,
diſpoſed according to the German manner, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
encamping in the Rere, and the Soldiers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Baracks for themſelves. The ſecond Line is
form'd of the Gens d' Arms, Huſſars, Pancernes,
Peteores, all call'd <hi>Touariches.</hi> The two Flanks
are clos'd by the Light Horſe, Coſſacs, Vallachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Poles, to whom there is added Pancernes
and Dragoons, as the Number of the Troops will
allow, and the Ground requires; ſo that the Camp
fronts every way, and the middle or ſpace betwixt
the two Lines ſerves for a Market to the Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Merchants and Purveyors.</p>
               <p>As to the Artillery, which is at the Head, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
without the Line, ſometimes in the Center. It
hath its particular Guard, <hi>viz.</hi> a Regiment deſign'd
for that purpoſe, called the Regiment of Artillery.
The Strageniks advanc'd Guard, is beyond the
Square, ſeparated from all the reſt, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaid.</p>
               <p>The King's Quarters, thoſe of the Senators,
Grand General and Volunteers is in this Incloſure,
adjoining to the Huſſars, at the Head of the Line,
which is begun by the King's Company, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of which commands all the reſt, and his
Drum gives the ſignal of March; there being no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54820:22"/>
ſuch thing amongſt the Poles as beating to the
Watch in the Evening, nor for a General March
in the Morning, during their Encampment.</p>
               <p>This leads me to ſpeak of their Tents, which
in <hi>Poland</hi> are extraordinary magnificent both for
Number and Beauty. They are the ſame with
thoſe of the Turks, that is to ſay, of a certain
coarſe Cloth, much like our Tent Cloth, painted
without, and lin'd with a Cotton Stuff, cut out in
Figures, Flower-Baskets, Squares, Compartments.
Their form differs according to the occaſion, ſome
have Pavillions with Porches in form of a Wall
and double Roofs; Some of them reſemble long
Halls, others are like ſquare Chambers, call'd
<hi>Cotars,</hi> made of coarſe Cloth, and lin'd with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stuff, reſembling Tapeſtry, with Glaſs-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Deal-floors, and encompaſſed without
by a great Wall that forms an Ally or Gallery
round it, which compoſes a Wardrobe, and a
Lodging-place for Servants. Theſe Cotars are of
admirable uſe in the advanced ſeaſon, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
true Stoves.</p>
               <p>As the Poles ſurpaſs all other European Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in this ſort of Magnificence, ſo the Turks do
much exceed the Poles; both of 'em affect to
ſhew their Pomp and Grandeur in the richneſs of
thoſe Moveable Houſes, as thinking them moſt
convenient for them. The Quarters of the Poliſh
Generals, and Turkiſh Pachas, are encompaſſed
with Walls that have Battlements, flanqu'd with
little Pavillions, or Turrets like Towns; they have
likewiſe Halls for Council, Cloſets, Porches to
eat in, great Kitchins and prodigious Stables. The
Parc or Quarter of the Grand Viſier before <hi>Vienna</hi>
was as large as St. <hi>Denis</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> that of the
Pacha of <hi>Egypt</hi> reſembled a Magnificent Pallace,
adorn'd in the inſide with Rich Tapiſtry, Alcoves
and Cuſhions. The Poliſh Senators make a faint
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54820:22"/>
Reſemblance of this Martial Pomp. It is a very
fine fight to ſee their Quarter, becauſe of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Colours, the Gilded Balls on their Pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
the diverſe Apartments, and the vaſt extent
of their Lodgings. The King hath ſo often defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Turks, who always leave conſiderable ſpoils
behind them, that his whole Quarter or Park is
made up of thoſe of the Baſſas he has defeated;
and amongſt others, of them that commanded the
Ottoman Army at <hi>Kotchim,</hi> called <hi>Soliman</hi> and
<hi>Uſſein,</hi> whoſe Tents demonſtrate the magnificence of
their Seraſquiers, or Commanders in Chief, and of
the Grand Senior's Favourites. <hi>Soliman</hi> had a Hall
for his Council or Divan, the Largeneſs and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of which charms me every time I think on it.
The Tapeſtry was of Silk and Gold, the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
and Figures of which were as agreeable
as the Matter was rich. The Columns that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
it were all gilt, and the Architecture of
them, reſembling thoſe of the Columns of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace;
the Cords of it were of Silk and Cotton, of
a wonderful Largeneſs and Beauty; and indeed
there are few People of Note, either in <hi>Poland</hi> or
<hi>Turky,</hi> but the Cordage of their Pavillions is of
Cotton.</p>
               <p>I ſhould here ſpeak of the Pay of the Poliſh
Armies, but have reaſon to fear that the Reader
will be weary of ſuch a particular account, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhall only ſay in general, that it would be
good enough if the Republic took care to give it
regularly; but they don't much trouble themſelves
to pay the ſame quarterly, according to the order
of the Diet. The Colonels, who are abſolute
Maſters of their Regiments, take leſs care to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute
to their Soldiers the little Mony which
they receive from the Treaſury, or from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
upon which their Pay is aſſigned; they never
clear Accounts with their Officers, but give them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54820:23"/>
only a Sum in part of what is due, which here
they call <hi>ad rationem,</hi> or on account; ſo that the
Captain is obliged to keep back the Pay of the
Subaltern, and the Soldiers who ſtarve for hunger,
whilſt the Captain makes up his loſs by pillaging
on his march. Indeed when they are in the Field,
he takes care for the ſubſiſtance of his Company;
for having neither Ammunition-bread, nor Sutlers,
at leaſt in no great number, the Soldiers would
ſtarve, and the Campagn by conſequence come
to nothing, if the Captain did not take care to
have Meat and Bacon carried on Waggons for his
Men; and this is the reaſon why they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to have ſo much Equipage.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader judge then, if any Man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or Officer of Merit can be fond of the Poliſh
Service, ſince he cannot live there without pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
nor have any ſatisfaction to ſee himſelf at
the Head of a Troop of Beggars in Rags, who
have neither Mein nor Diſcipline, all their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
conſiſting in forming of a Battalion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
their Pieces. If they were to make a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Attaque, the Major Generals themſelves
would find it hard enough to manage a Trench;
and yet they are for the moſt part choſen out of
the ableſt Officers, and the eldeſt Colonels of the
Foreign Army. Their Office looks ſomewhat like
a French Mareſchal de Camp, but in <hi>Poland</hi> it is
a meer vain Title without Profit, and Authority
without Sallary.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be diſcourſed of, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their Pay, is the advantages of the Great
Treaſurer of <hi>Poland,</hi> becauſe of the dependance
the Army has upon him, and the Compoſitions
which the Officers are obliged to make with him,
who quit part of what is their due, to have the
reſt in ready Mony. Thus they ſay Count <hi>Morſtin</hi>
enriched himſelf when he was Great Treaſurer of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54820:23"/>
the Crown. But when this Officer is too rigorous,
he may occaſion great Diſorders, if not Revolts,
which endanger himſelf. There was an Inſtance
of this in the Reign of King <hi>Caſimir,</hi> upon <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefski,</hi>
the Grand General and Treaſurer of <hi>Lithu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ania,</hi>
which may well make his Succeſſors tremble.
The Lithuanian Army being diſſatisfied with ſome
Article or Command of the Treaſury, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a Confederacy againſt this Lord; twenty
five Towariches, or ſworn Officers, went to his
Houſe, pulled him out of his Bed from his Lady,
carried him to the Field, with a Confeſſor at his
Heels, oblig'd him to confeſs himſelf ſpeedily,
and afterwards kill'd him. This unparallel'd
Crime was only puniſhed on a ſmall number of
thoſe Madmen that were found, whoſe Heads were
cut off; one of them being condemned to have
his Hand burnt off, holding certain Papers in it;
and being daub'd over with Pitch, ſuffer'd that
puniſhment with as much Conſtancy as <hi>Scevola,</hi>
without ever opening his Hand, or turning away
his Head.</p>
               <p>Since I am come to ſpeak of the Army of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania,</hi>
I ſhall only ſay, that it is an Auxiliary
Body, independant on the Army of the Crown,
ſubmitting only to their own Generals, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
no Supream. They aſſemble the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
aſſign them Quarters, and act with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own Pleaſure and Intereſt; tho'
in general they regulate themſelves by the Councils
held at the end of the Diets, or the beginning of the
Campagns; but thoſe Reſolves, and their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
never keep pace: Their beſt concerted Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
do frequently miſcarry for want of Union
and Agreement. For Example during the Siege
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which I am going to relate. The King
was returning back to <hi>Poland,</hi> when the Lithuani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
join'd him in <hi>Hungary.</hi> At the Battle of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54820:24"/>
                  <hi>Kotchim,</hi> their Grand General <hi>Pats</hi> refus'd a long
time to fight, ſo that the Crown General, then
call'd the Great Mareſchal <hi>Sobieski,</hi> took it upon
himſelf in point of Honour, and reſolv'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for the Event; notwithſtanding all which,
<hi>Pats</hi> would not Charge till after <hi>Sobieski</hi> had
forced the Turkiſh Camp, but retir'd from the
Council the night before, refuſing to conſent to
the Expedition. During the famous Campagn,
which General <hi>Sobieski,</hi> then King, continued ſo
long in the <hi>Winter,</hi> the Lithuanian Army refus'd
to follow him after ſome days march, which did
ſo much provoke that Great Prince, that he
publiſhed Circular Letters to ſend them back as
uſeleſs, which might be called a Caſheiring them,
if the King had that deſpotical Authority in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
He compleated that Expedition only with
the Army of the Crown, and ſubdued all <hi>Ukrania</hi>
to the Republick, whoſe Standards he advanced
within ten days Journey of the <hi>Black Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us ſpeak at preſent of the Arms of the
<hi>Poles</hi> in general. Of old they made uſe only of
Scimiters, Lances, Gides, Javelins, Bows and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;
at preſent they have added Fire-Arms, and
moſt of them have Piſtols, with which they don't
hit very exactly, tho' they be great Skirmiſhers.
By degrees they lay aſide their Lances and Gides;
their Javelins are almoſt wholly diſuſed, ſo that
they have nothing of the Old Sarmatian Armour
left but the Bow and Arrow. The firſt Journy I
made into <hi>Poland,</hi> all Horſemen, of any diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Gentlemen belonging to the King,
Queen and Senators, ſtill carry'd them, ev'n as they
travell'd thro' the Country, and made a Noble Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of thoſe Arms in time of Peace. I have
ſeen the King and Princes carry them; they are
not unbecoming, nor unſeemly in a Chamber,
where the Poles expoſe them upon a piece of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54820:24"/>
Tapeſtry by their Beds ſide, as a very conſiderable
part of Houſholdſtuff. Tho' indeed this Armor is
of no other uſe to them but for Ornament, for
they are not very dextrous at throwing the Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
nor at ſhooting with the Bow as are the Turks
and Tartars, who uſe them in Skirmiſhes inſtead
of Fire-Arms. Yet there are ſtill ſome Poles who
are very dextrous at this Exerciſe. The King eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
hath a particular grace in managing the
ſame, and a ſtrength accompanied with a dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that comes nothing ſhort of the Nations, that
have moſt experience in thoſe ſort of Weapons.
From this uſe of Arms formerly ſo common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Poles, they form'd a Proverb anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to our French Proverb, of knowing the Sole
by the motion of the Foot, to denote the pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
and diſcerning faculty of any one, who
diſcovers in another the Marks and Signs of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Conduct. I heard a pretty application of it
by the King in a Senate, who ſpeaking to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of a contrary Party, that pretended
to give advice for the good of the Republick, but
pointed indirectly at ſome part of the King's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
which he had a mind to blame; that diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prince ſignified to him, that he had diſcover'd
the Secret, and knew his Deſign, by telling him,
<hi>that when he ſaw an Arrow in the Air, he could
tell from what Quiver it came.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Poles had formerly Bucklers of Ozier, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Skins, of a round Figure a little rais'd,
pointed in the middle, where there was a piece of
Iron, the uſe of which is now almoſt aboliſhed.
I have ſeen ſome Lords carry them in a day of
Review or Battle, not ſo much for Defence as for
Ornament; for on ſuch Occaſions they fix them
to the Saddles of their Led-Horſes. When the
King march'd to the Relief of <hi>Vienna,</hi> he had a
mind to review his Cavalry in the Plain of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novitz,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54820:25"/>
the firſt City of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> before Count <hi>Caraffa,</hi>
who was ſent by the Emperor to receive his Allie at
the entrance of his Dominions. The King drew them
up in Order of Battle the morning before his March,
that the Emperor's Miniſters might ſee the Beauty
of his Troops. The Poliſh Senators, who had there
their Troops of Huſſars or <hi>Pancernes,</hi> appear'd at the
Head of 'em with all the Warlike Ornaments of
the Nation; their Rich Murrions, Gilt Harneſs,
Magnificent Houzes, ſplendid Coats of Mail, and
ſome of them had Bucklers of great price, for ſo
I think we may call 300 Ducats of Gold for a
Buckler of Ozier. It's true they alledge that they
are proof againſt Shot, but for any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by them, there's nothing to commend them
but a pleaſant variety of Colours, and a Satin
Quilt in the inſide. The King who has in the
Armorial Bearings of his Houſhold a Buckler of
the Roman Form, that is to ſay, long and pointed
below, with an Orillon on the upper part, had one
of this faſhion of Beaten Gold fixed to his Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
upon which there was in Baſs Relief, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of the Battle of <hi>Kotchim</hi> very well
done. That Prince us'd to place the ſame Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and a Scimiter enriched with Jewels, upon
the Table of the Chamber of Audience, on thoſe
days when he admitted the Ambaſſadors of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes.</p>
               <p>The Poles have a Scimiter longer and heavier
than thoſe of the Turks, but don't cut ſo well,
whether the fault be in the Blade or Hand. The
Poles endeavour to accuſtom themſelves to the uſe
of this Heavy Weapon, by the continual uſe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Battle Axes of great weight, to break their
Arm, as they term it, for the uſe of the Scimiter.
Beſides they make it a kind of exerciſe, and ſtudy
to accuſtom themſelves to the uſe of it, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
fencing with Clubs, to which their Youth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54820:25"/>
is much addicted. There's conſtantly to be ſeen
in the Streets of <hi>Warſaw</hi> and other Cities, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when the Court is there, Troops of Boys, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and others fighting with Clubs; they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
thoſe who paſs by, and will put Clubs in
their hands to oblige them to fight, as Fleurets are
preſented in a Fencing-Room to the Spectators that
come in. This general Cuſtom joyn'd to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Animoſity there is betwixt the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuanians,</hi>
hath given riſe to a very bad Cuſtom,
which the Publick connives at either from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Stupidity or Policy, as thoſe of <hi>Venice</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Quarrels betwixt their <hi>Nicolotti</hi> and <hi>Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lani.</hi>
During the Diets the Servants or Followers
of the Nobility, who are moſt of them Gentlemen,
aſſemble together according to their Country, take
the Field with Drums and Trumpets, take up thoſe
they find in the Streets, force them along with
them, and fight bloody Battles, tho' only with
Clubs, the Conquerors purſue the Conquered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege
them in the Neighbouring houſes, and enter
as formally into the Town, as if they were Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Troops, and this almoſt every day, having firſt
choſen a Mareſchal or Preſident for each Party,
which is here an indiſpenſible Cuſtom in Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of all ſorts, which may rather be call'd Routs,
becauſe of the Confuſion that is to be found in
thoſe of them that are the moſt famous and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
This Mareſchal preſuppoſes that there have
been other Leſſer Combats, for in order to become
Mareſchal, he muſt have conquered all the other
Candidates, and the braveſt of thoſe Champions.
Antipathy and a deſire of Conquering, have inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
rendred thoſe Battles very dangerous; for in
1690. they begun to make uſe of Fire-Arms, and
this Licentiouſneſs roſe to that degree of fury, that
there was a neceſſity of ſending the Guards to
diſperſe this Rabble, who had made ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54820:26"/>
kill'd abundance of People, and beſieged
the Houſe of a Palatin. Thoſe of the Crown di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
themſelves from the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> by a
Handkerchief they put in their Hats inſtead of a
Scarf; and as they are moſt numerous, they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
come off Maſters of the Field at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> but
then the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> have alſo their Tour at the
Diets held at <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Such is the Order of the Armies of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
who might perhaps be as good as formerly,
were they complete, paid, and well entertain'd,
but the want of thoſe things hath diſſolv'd their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Diſcipline, and made the braveſt of them
indifferent for the Service, which neither deſire of
Glory, ſenſe of Honour or Duty, have been able
to cure. The General Officer, the Collonels and
Captains go to the Camp as to an unprofitable
Drudgery. Nay, the firſt do now begin to forbear
their attendance without ſhame, and ſpend their
time at their Country-houſes, or at Court. The
Subaltern does not begin his March till two months
after the time appointed for Rendezvouz, and the
Touarizes don't make much more haſte, ſo that the
Grand General wearies himſelf out by ſtaying
alone in the Camp waiting for the Troops, and thus
is witneſs to the loſing of many opportunities, and
ſees the beſt concerted Deſigns and Enterprizes miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
by thoſe diſorders and unaccountable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managements
joyn'd with the Natural Careleſneſs
of the <hi>Poles,</hi> and the Impunity to which they are
accuſtomed. The Palatin of <hi>Ruſsia</hi> the preſent
Grand General, does indeed begin to make his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
valued, and to reſtore Diſcipline in the
Camp, having order'd ſeveral People to have their
Heads cut off at the Entrance of the Campagne
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54820:26"/>
of 1688. He likewiſe check'd the fooliſh Pride of
the <hi>Huſſars,</hi> by taking away their Lances, arming
them with Carbines, and ſending them out upon
advanc'd Guards and Convoys as Light Horſe. This
he began in 1689, and if he continue, there may
be ſome hopes of reſtoring the Antient Poliſh Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
for theſe Troops are not really bad, but
fight in great and ſmall Bodies, as well as thoſe of
other Countries, if they be well managed. They
underſtand little of the Art of War during a Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,
as to know how to ſeize a Poſt or Defile.
They are yet more ignorant of the Way of Manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Party, tho' they make very large ones; and
we may truly ſay, they underſtand nothing of
Sieges. All their time is ſpent in ordinary Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes
and Fights. The Stratagems of War are
little known amongſt them. They ſend out for
intelligence or diſcoveries ſome <hi>Coſſack</hi> Foot, who
Lye in Ambuſcade one by one in Woods, or hide
themſelves in a hole that they dig in the ground
like Badgers, and flie like Wolves upon any miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
fellow that ſtraggles from the Camp, or on
a March, and this Priſoner they call a <hi>Tongue,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of his informing them of the State of the
Enemies Army. After the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> I ſaw
one of thoſe Savage Partymen return to the K. with
a Turk tied ſo as a Huntſman does a great Beaſt,
and puſh him brutiſhly into the Tent without
ſpeaking a word. The K. gave thoſe <hi>Coſſacks</hi> ten
Crowns for each <hi>Tongue,</hi> as they call them; and
relied very much upon them for getting ſuch fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
on occaſion, as the fitteſt perſons in the Army
for that Trade; as to which I cannot omit one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
which may ſerve to give the Reader a
better Character of thoſe Savage Fellows. A <hi>Coſſack</hi>
returned one Evening with a Turk taken in that
manner as I have ſaid, threw him into the Kings
Tent, juſt as if one ſhould throw down a Bundle
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54820:27"/>
upon the ground, and then went to the Treaſurer
for his Premium; after which he returned to the
Door of the Tent, and thruſting in his head to
thank the K. ſaid, <hi>John, They have paid me, God
reſtore it thee, and good night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their great Parties are uſually conſiderable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments,
or Entire Brigades of Poliſh Cavalry.
Thoſe Brigades are from 600 to 1000 Men, and
are call'd <hi>Poulk.</hi> Thus all the <hi>Gens d'Arms</hi> are
divided amongſt the principal Officers of this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as is alſo the reſt of the Cavalry, <hi>Coſſacks, Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachians,</hi>
or <hi>Poles,</hi> whoſe Poulks are compoſed of
40 Companies. We muſt except the <hi>Huſſars,</hi>
who don't enter into the Brigades, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
ſerving alone. The Brigadiers of the reſt
are twice as proud, but nothing braver than
the other Officers. I knew one of them call'd
<hi>Miogensky,</hi> that was firſt Gentleman of the Kings
Chamber, and is now Treaſurer of the Court, who
hearing ſome <hi>Poles</hi> returned from <hi>France,</hi> telling
<hi>Wonders</hi> of the Valour of the Troops of the Kings
Houſhold, boaſted that he would with his Poulk
and a hundred Horſe only, beat all thoſe Gens
d' Arms to pieces. This Bravo ſaid, he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
from a Party without putting his Enemy to
flight, tho' a whole Garriſon, and that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed
the Enemy to the very Gates of <hi>Caminieck:</hi>
Yet never did any Man flie better than this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and his Brigade, on two occaſions, eſpecially at
the Town of <hi>Eperiez</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where he was
ſhamefully beat by a Party of Rebels.</p>
               <p>I muſt not forget one Circumſtance relating to
the Huſſars, which is that every Year they had
new Lances given them at the beginning of the
Campagn; for it was ſuppoſed for their Honour,
that they had broke thoſe of the preceding Year;
and indeed formerly nothing more ſhameful could
befal an Huſſar, than to bring back his Lance from
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54820:27"/>
an Engagement, and therefore new ones were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
carried in Waggons with the Camp to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
thoſe that were broken. At the beginning of
each Campagn, when the Captain gave the Huſſar,
his Lance he uſed to give him a Preſent of 100
Crowns with it towards the Charge of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn,
beſides his Pay from the Republick.</p>
               <p>There's another Circumſtance no leſs neceſſary
to be known for the better diſcovery of the Poliſh
Genius, and their way of making War, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the Huſſars Pancernes and other Gens d'Arms
who are paid their Winter Quarters in Silver, and
have nothing to look for from the place where the
Company is Quarter'd, ſpend that time either
at home or at their Captains Court, and leave
their Servants only with the Standard. In 1688.
the Tartars made an Irruption towards <hi>Volhynia,</hi>
where they forced ſome Regiments of Foot into
places fortified with Palliſado's, and carried off
whole Companies of Huſſars, as was ſaid in the
Gazetts, but 'twas only the Pacolets or Huſſars
Servants; and beſides, there were ſeveral Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
particularly that of the Great Chancellor of
<hi>Lithuania,</hi> which had not above ſeven or eight Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
at moſt left to guard the Standard.</p>
               <p>Being unwilling to tire the Reader with any
more particulars of this nature, I come now to
the particular Account of the famous Expedition of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> which was ſo extraordinary in all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
ſo happy in its Succeſs, ſo ill diſputed
by the Turks, and ſo little expected by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
An Expedition famous for its Event, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
for the Number of Princes that came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to put themſelves under the Command of the
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> whoſe great Fame excited a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Curioſity, and laid the Foundation of the
Hope of the Empire. I ſhall relate the Matter
as a faithful Hiſtorian, being ready to account
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54820:28"/>
for the Truth of my Relation before thoſe who
were preſent at that great Action.</p>

               <head>CAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">Containing the Relation of the Campagn of 1683:
being the firſt after the Rupture of the Truce
betwixt the Emperour and Turks.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire became ſo formidable
under the Reign of Sultan <hi>Mabomet</hi> IV.
and the Miniſtry of the two Grand Viſirs, <hi>Kuproli</hi>
the Father and Son, that the leaſt March of the
Infidels gave the Alarm to all Europe. The Battle
on the Banks of the <hi>Raab,</hi> where the Auxiliary
Troops of <hi>France</hi> put a ſtop to the progreſs of the
Turks, and ſaved all <hi>Germany,</hi> did a little diminiſh
the fear on that ſide: But their ſubduing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Candie</hi> in 1669. by taking its Capital re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
it. The Grand Viſir <hi>Ahmet Kuproli,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Politicks of the Port made a Truce
of twenty years with the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the bad ſucceſs of the Battle of <hi>Raab</hi> or Saint
<hi>Gothar.</hi> He renewed a Truce with the Republick
of <hi>Venice,</hi> that ſtood in need of a breathing after
their Uſeleſs Expence and Efforts to preſerve the
Kingdom of <hi>Candie,</hi> which that ſame <hi>Kuproli</hi> had
juſt taken from them.</p>
               <p>The Sultan bethought himſelf afterwards on
other Conqueſts: He turn'd his Arms againſt the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> upon the mouth of the Boriſthenes or
Nieper, which he ſhut up with his Fortreſſes to
prevent the Incurſions of the Coſſacs, and their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Black-Sea. He attaqu'd the Poles,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1672. and in perſon beſieged <hi>Caminiec,</hi> the
Capital of <hi>Podolia,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Yaſloviets</hi> and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54820:28"/>
                  <hi>Bouchach,</hi> advancing further into the Province,
which was all ſubdued or ruined. Theſe ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Exploits extended themſelves into <hi>Ukrania,</hi>
whoſe Revolt the Grand Senior favoured, and he
would have extended his Arms into the very heart
of the Kingdom towards the <hi>Viſtula</hi> if the Grand
General and great Mareſchal <hi>Sobieski,</hi> had not
ruin'd all his vaſt Projects by the Battle of <hi>Kochin,</hi>
where he defeated a flouriſhing Army, commanded
by two Baſſa's of Reputation, <hi>Soliman</hi> and <hi>Uſſeyn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Defeat put the Turks out of a condition to
oppoſe themſelves next Year to the Irruption of
the Victorious <hi>Sobieski</hi> then choſen King, who in
1674 recover'd part of <hi>Ukrania,</hi> and advanc'd, as
has been ſaid already, within ten days Journey of
the Black-Sea. But being much weakened with
that long Expedition, in the middle of the Winter,
during which the Tartars having joyn'd the Rebel
Coſſacs under their Commander <hi>Doro Chenko,</hi> they
haraſſed him continually, &amp; once ſhut him up near
<hi>Bratſlavia.</hi> Thus the Sultan gain'd the upper-hand
of him again, and in 1675 repulſed him as far as
<hi>Leopold,</hi> and at laſt ſhut the Poliſh Army up in
their Camp near <hi>Jurafno,</hi> and attaqu'd them in
their Trenches, where after a very bloody Fight,
the two Nations made a Treaty for many years,
and the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſent an Ambaſſador to the
Port to Ratifie that Peace, when the Turks by a
Contravention very ordinary amongſt them, forc'd
the Poliſh Plenipotentiary to add and diminiſh
what they thought meet.</p>
               <p>The Sultan renewed the War againſt the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites.</hi>
His good fortune which <hi>Kuprolis</hi> Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
maintain'd with luſtre, did not fail him under
his Succeſſor <hi>Kara Muſtapha Pacha</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Miniſtry. This Viſir beſieged the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
<hi>Tcherrim,</hi> and took it in the ſight of above
100000 Men who came to its Relief, which did
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54820:29"/>
ſo raiſe his Courage and Vanity, that he thought
nothing too hard for him to undertake. He was
at that time in favour with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whoſe
Daughter he had married. His Riches were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe.
The Sultans Treaſury being fill'd with the
Spoils of Chriſtians, and his Empire encreaſed by
conſiderable Conqueſts, he thought there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could hinder his attaining to the Univerſal
Empire. The Example of his Predeceſſor ſerv'd
him inſtead of a Plan to direct him in his deſign.
<hi>Kuproli</hi> had form'd that of ſubduing <hi>Italy,</hi> towards
which he had opened his way by taking of <hi>Candie,</hi>
and which he had in a manner block'd up on one
ſide by the places he was poſſeſs'd of in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi>
and on the other by the Provinces which lye at
the back of it, <hi>viz. Boſnia, Sclavonia,</hi> and the
other Provinces of the Antient <hi>Illyria;</hi> and beſides
this, by the Fortreſſes that the Sultan had gain'd
gradually almoſt to the Gulph of <hi>Venice.</hi> On the
ſide of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Sultan was poſſeſſed of the
Country from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Styria</hi> on one part,
and to the Frontiers of <hi>Auſtria</hi> on the other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
betwixt the <hi>Danube</hi> and the <hi>Dnieſter,</hi> which
he had rendred Tributary, <hi>viz. Vallachia, Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> formerly the Country of
the <hi>Dacae.</hi> So that if he could have got <hi>Vienna</hi>
for a place of Arms, he would have incloſed by
a double Creſcent <hi>Italy</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Poland</hi>
on the other. He had ſufficiently diſcovered his
deſign to conquer <hi>Vienna</hi> by taking <hi>Neuhauſel,</hi> and
afterwards attempting <hi>Raab,</hi> which commands
both the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and is within eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hours March of <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Marquis <hi>de
St. Andre Montbrun,</hi> had perceiv'd his deſign in
regard of <hi>Italy,</hi> when after the taking of <hi>Candie,</hi>
which he had defended ſo long, and with ſo much
bravery, he wrote into <hi>France, That the Grand
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54820:29"/>
Viſir</hi> Kuproli <hi>had opened a Way to</hi> Rome, <hi>and by
what he knew of that Ottoman Generals humour,
he doubted not but he had a deſign to turn St.</hi> Peters
<hi>Church into the Grand Seniors Stables;</hi> but the
death of the ſaid Viſir defeated all thoſe deſigns.
This Viſir was born in a Village of <hi>Illyria,</hi> called
<hi>Kuprocu,</hi> whence his Family took the name of
<hi>Kuprioli,</hi> ſo that he was not the Son of a French
Renegado, as ſome have falſly given out. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Mehemet Kuproli</hi> was likewiſe Prime Viſir,
one of the Greateſt Men that ever fill'd that Poſt,
and executed that Charge with as much ſucceſs
and capacity as ever his Son did, who ſucceeded
him in the Miniſtry, and which is look'd upon as
a Prodigy that two Grand Viſirs ſhould have died
in their Beds, and ſucceeded one another. He left
a Brother behind him, as great a Man as himſelf,
and more learned, whom he conſulted in all his
Enterprizes. He lived obſcurely as Governour of
<hi>Chio,</hi> but in 1689. the new Sultan <hi>Solyman</hi> brought
him from thence, and advanc'd him to the ſupream
Government of the State which his Father and
Elder Brother had enjoy'd. But I return to my
Story.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kara Muſtapha Pacha</hi> willing to follow the
Plan, laid down by his Predeceſſor, reſolv'd on
the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> to raiſe the Glory of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and himſelf above that of the Grand <hi>Solyman,</hi>
otherwiſe called the <hi>Magnificent,</hi> who fail'd of
taking that place, becauſe of his not daring to
Risk his Fortune againſt that of the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> V. who came to Relieve it with an Army
of 80000 Men. Beſides this thought his Vain
Ambition inſpired him with another, which as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Turks inform'd me, was to out-rival <hi>Louis
le Grand,</hi> to conquer <hi>Germany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and
make himſelf Emperour of the French, and thoſe
Viſions of his were known in the Divan and Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54820:30"/>
Such a Vaſt Deſign required Extraordinary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
which the Viſir work'd on for ſeven or
eight years with wonderful application, ſo that
there never was ſeen ſuch a vaſt deal of Money,
Ammunition, Artillery and Equipage as he amaſs'd.
He thought to have taken <hi>Vienna</hi> immediately, as
he did <hi>Tcherryn,</hi> being mightily poſſeſſed with an
Opinion of his own Valour, and a contempt of
the <hi>Germans,</hi> whoſe Valour he meaſur'd by that
of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and therefore had provided all
neceſſaries for revictualling the place forthwith,
thinking to make it the place of his Reſidence,
and therefore he had a Magazin and Arſenal kept
apart in his Camp to be thrown into the City af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
its being reduc'd. We muſt not deny the Viſir
the Juſtice that is due to him concerning this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
and the putting it in Execution ſince this vaſt
thought was conducted with ſo much abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
care and prudence to the very Baſtions of
<hi>Vienna.</hi> Never was there a bolder Enterprize than
this, which the Hand of the Lord only did fruſtrate;
Nothing was ever more fine than the Preparations
he made for it; Nothing more glorious than his
firſt ſucceſs, ſo that no General could carry on any
thing further by his own Ability had Foreſight,
the reſt is in the hands of the Lord of Hoſts, who
ſcatters them with his Breath, as he did here
this Army of Infidels.</p>
               <p>Beſides thoſe Great Precautions <hi>Kara Muſtapha</hi>
was not wanting in thoſe Excellent Qualities which
make a Complete General. He had Valour, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and Capacity, but with thoſe an unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
Boldneſs and Preſumption, ſupported by his
Riches, and the favour of the Sultan his Son-in-Law,
which Character he maintain'd with all the
Grandeur, Expence, Pride and Splendor imaginable.
His Equipage, his Houſe, his Furniture equall'd the
Magnificence of Kings, and ſurpaſſed that of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54820:30"/>
greateſt of other Princes. That which I ſaw of it
in the Army was ſurprizing, his Waggons for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
what belonged to his Chamber were painted
and gilt. His Turkiſh Coffers, which are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Ozier, and covered with Leather, were covered
with Crimſon Velvet; his Pavillions, his Tapeſtry,
his Moveables diſcover'd ſo much Pride and Pomp,
as makes what the Romans ſaid of the Antient
Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> credible. And as to theſe things
deſign'd for his own uſe, never was there any
thing ſeen more beautiful, delicate, handſome, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and rich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially in his Armour, Scymiters,
<hi>Anchars</hi> or Daggers, Quivers, Bow-caſes, Saddles,
Houſſes, Harneſs for his Horſes; but ſtill more in
things prepar'd for his own Body, as Girdles, Veſts,
Turbans, which were ſo covered with Jewels, that
nothing elſe was to be ſeen. He had 150 <hi>Valets de
Chamber,</hi> who had nothing elſe to do, but every
one of them to take care of one piece of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
as three of them inform'd us who were taken
in the Camp before <hi>Vienna</hi> after he fled. To look
upon this ſurprizing Treaſure of Riches and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Equipage, one would think that this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
came rather to a Triumph than Battle, and ſo
much the more that there, was found in his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
abundance of rich Standards of Cloth of Gold
deſign'd for a Triumphal Pomp, and ſome Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Eſtabliſhing a Moſque, but the King of
<hi>Poland</hi> Conſecrated 'em in diverſe Churches to the
Glory of the God of Hoſts, as that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at
<hi>Rome, Loretto,</hi> and diverſe Churches of his own
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add, to compleat the Viſirs Character,
that he was a handſome Man, tho' of a ſwarthy
black Complexion, like thoſe of certain remote
Provinces in <hi>Aſia,</hi> as is ſignified by his Name <hi>Kara,</hi>
which in the Turkiſh, is as much as to ſay Black.
There are diverſe perſons of this Colour at the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54820:31"/>
Sultans Court; <hi>Mahomet</hi> IV. himſelf is ſo, as was
the <hi>Caimacan,</hi> and the Viſir of <hi>Buda,</hi> the Viſirs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Friend, who was preferr'd to that Poſt by
his means inſtead of another who was a Man of
ſenſe, and diſſwaded the Port from undertaking
the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> for which ſage Advice he
was rewarded with the Loſs of his Head.</p>
               <p>The Fame of the Great Preparations of the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
Court ſpread abroad inſenſibly; the King
of <hi>Poland</hi> at the ſame time bethought himſelf of
Preparations. The Diet of <hi>Grodno</hi> having left the
diſpoſition of the Affair to him, he ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
into diverſe Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> but the Cabals
amongſt them for driving on their private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
made all the good deſigns of that Prince to
miſcarry. The Convocation of 1681. terminated
in vain diſputes. The Diet of 1681. was broke by
the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> Intrigues, ſo that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing was ſuſpended in that Country by the
miſunderſtanding there was amongſt the Members
of the Republick.</p>
               <p>The Muſcovites on the contrary thought of
nothing but Peace. The Czar ſent one to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
to treat of it, and at the ſame time, that he
might have two Strings to his Bow, according to
the vulgar ſaying, he ſent an Ambaſſador to the
Convocation at <hi>Warſaw</hi> in 1680. to propoſe a
League againſt the Turks, that ſo by threatning
the Port with that Alliance, he might obtain the
better Conditions, or aſſure himſelf of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the Republick in caſe the Treaty with
the Turks came to break off. But having ſucceeded
in their deſign at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> they recall'd their
Ambaſſador from <hi>Warſaw,</hi> and the following year,
<hi>viz.</hi> July 1681. the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſent an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy
into <hi>Perſia</hi> to repreſent to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> the
Advantages he might reap in that conjuncture, if
he would declare againſt the Sultan, who being
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54820:31"/>
taken up with his Vaſt Deſign againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
could not be in a condition to diſpute the
Conqueſt of <hi>Babylon</hi> with him, which was taken
from his Predeceſſors by <hi>Amurat;</hi> but the <hi>Sophi</hi>
would not liſten to thoſe Overtures, preferring the
Intereſt of his Religion to the Aggrandizing of his
Empire, tho' the Turks themſelves look upon the
Perſians as Infidels, becauſe they follow <hi>Alis</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Yet on this occaſion he
would manifeſt to the Turks, that tho' he err'd
according to them in point of Diſcipline, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
their Eſſential Opinions, and was acted by the
true Spirit of Mahometiſm, in ſacrificing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Intereſts of his Glory to their common Sect.
Thus Count <hi>Siry</hi> the Poliſh Ambaſſador return'd
without having been able to engage the <hi>Sophi</hi> by
the Natural Motives of Ambition or Grandeur,
he lov'd his Repoſe and Pleaſures cover'd over
with the pretext of Conſcience, better than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of <hi>Babylon</hi> his Antient Patrimony, and its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
he alſo inform'd the Sultan of it, to aſſure
him againſt all fears of any ſuch diverſion.</p>
               <p>The Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> being more allarm'd than
the reſt of Chriſtendom, labour'd with all poſſible
Application to cover themſelves from the Storm
with which they were menaced. Count <hi>Teckleys</hi>
Progreſs in Upper <hi>Hungary</hi> ſeem'd to prepare the
Grand Seniors path, ſo that the Imperial Miniſters
endeavour'd all they could to lay ſome Obſtacles
in his way. They prevail'd in <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> where
Prince <hi>Michael Albaffi</hi> abandon'd the Rebels by
degrees; they alſo engaged the King of <hi>Poland</hi> on
the Emperors ſide, and in the mean time until they
could pry further into the Deſigns of the Turks,
the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> maintain'd the War againſt
Count <hi>Teckley</hi> with as much Vigour as they could.
General <hi>Caprara</hi> wandred up and down in <hi>Hungary,</hi>
without being able to ſave the Provinces, the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:54820:32"/>
Count taking Places of importance there
every day in ſpight of him. The Grand Viſir well
knowing the importance of the Counts Progreſs,
which made his ſo much the eaſier, neglected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to fortifie the Malecontents, ſent them Troops
inſtead of the Tranſylvanians who had withdrawn,
and had a mind to have depoſed <hi>Abaffi,</hi> for which
end he was ſummon'd to the Port; but ſuſpecting
the reaſon, he avoided the Snare by temporizing,
and paying his Money inſtead of going in Perſon.
The Grand Viſir had a mind to Inveſt Count <hi>Teck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
with that Province, until ſuch time as he could
beſtow on him the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> of which
he enjoyed part already, with the Title of Prince. He
was at the ſame time declared the Son of the Port.
He had an Army aſſign'd him with three Pachas to
act towards <hi>Presburg</hi> on one ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi>
whilſt the Grand Viſir was to act with the other
towards <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Bohemia;</hi> one part
of his Vaſt Deſign being to march directly to

               <p>Matters being thus ſtated, the Emperor in the
beginning of 1683. ſent Count <hi>Albert Caprara</hi> to
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to endeavour to renew the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
betwixt the two Empires, by renewing the
Truce concluded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fter the Battle of <hi>Raab,</hi> ſome
years of which were ſtill unexpir'd, and by this
means to diſcover the Intentions of the Sultan, &amp;
the State of his Forces and Affairs. But the Grand
Senior was ſo far from liſtening to Count <hi>Caprara,</hi>
that inſtead of renewing the Truce, he prepar'd
to break it before the Term was expir'd, and it
was publiſh'd to the World, that the Grand Senior
had wrote an Anſwer to the Emperor in threatning
and execrable Terms, the Puniſhment of which
was not long deferr'd, ſince that ſame City of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> in which it is ſaid he threatned to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54820:32"/>
him <hi>in ſpigbt of his Crucified God,</hi> was the
Rock on which his Power was ſhipwreck'd, and
gave the firſt Mortal Blow to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire,
by the terrible Arm of that ſame God, who overturns
the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> as the leaſt Shrub in the Vallys.</p>
               <p>The Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> had no Recourſe to any
but to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and he after conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the League, labour'd with all poſſible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to raiſe the Army that the Republick had
reſolved to pay, he gave out Commiſſions to the
Collonels, and ſent into <hi>Ukrania</hi> to raiſe Coſſaes
with the Money he had from the Pope, that Prince
relying much upon this People, becauſe of the
Antient Valour of the Infantry of their Nation. I
have heard him a hundred times cry out upon the
ſlowneſs of thoſe Troops, for not coming up in
time, he did all he could to haſten their Levies,
and recommended it to the Queen at parting, to
haſten their March all ſhe could, as if the ſafety
of <hi>Vienna</hi> had ſolely depended upon the preſence
of the Coſſacs. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> open'd his own
Coffers, a thing which his own Family could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hope for at his hands, and which Strangers
never expected, It is certain that all that paſs'd
in thoſe Preparations of War, was a true Miracle in
regard of that Country, where the Execution is
ſlower than the Reſolves. The Emperors Miniſters
acted alſo on their part, and gave out the Sums
promiſed to haſten the Army; every one diſcover'd
their carefulneſs in this matter, yet <hi>Poland</hi> could
never get together 18000 Men. <hi>Lithuania</hi> did
very little better; their Generals could ſcarcely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
6000 Horſe, Dragoons, or Gens d'Arms, nor
did they artive in <hi>Hungary</hi> till the latter end of
<hi>October;</hi> but to ſay the truth, never was there any
thing ſo fine, nor well equipped, as all thoſe Troops
both of th'one and t'other Nation.</p>
               <p>The Court, after the Diet of 1683. retir'd to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54820:33"/>
                  <hi>Villaneuf,</hi> where the Queen was brought to bed of
a Prince about the end of <hi>June,</hi> which was taken
for a happy preſage of the proſperity of the
Royal Family. The King made an end of his
Conſults there, and ſent his ſecret Spies into the
Enemies Country to learn their Motions, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their Marches. He ſent into <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi>
whoſe Prince <hi>Michael Abaffy</hi> before-mentioned, not
being able to diſpence with following the Grand
Viſir, did nevertheleſs entertain a ſtrict Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with His Majeſty, and never fail'd neither
in Fidelity or Exactneſs, writing to him Regularly
ev'n by Expreſs from the Camp before <hi>Vienna;</hi>
informing him of their Attaques, Loſſes and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
by way of Journal, and all in as good
and pure Latin as any that was wrote in the time
of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> I ſaw all thoſe Diſpatches, and
ſhould have publiſh'd them here in particular, if
His Majeſty would have conſented to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
thoſe Memoirs which are ſo much for his
Glory; but he hath no itch after that Fame and
Renown which Men are ſo fond of elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Teckley</hi> entertain'd alſo a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with His Majeſty, but with more reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it not being his Intereſt to favour the League,
or the Germans his Mortal Enemies, tho' it was
to keep in with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> that he might
be a ſupport to him, and Moderator for him, in
caſe the Turks receiv'd any conſiderable Check,
beſides the Intereſt he had to preſerve his Eſtate on
the Poliſh Frontiers, and to ſecure his Lady, who
was ſhut up in the <hi>Mongatz,</hi> a ſtrong Fortreſs in
his Patrimony ſcituated in the Mountains near <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia;</hi>
it being moreover plain, that it was not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
but Policy that obliged him to ſerve the
Turks. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſent a ſecret Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1683. to reſide near his perſon, and
to entertain this Correſpondence with mutual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54820:33"/>
that the King ſhould not attack <hi>Hungary</hi>
towards his Frontiers, and that Count <hi>Teckley</hi>
ſhould not come near <hi>Cracow,</hi> where he might
have ſeized the Court after the March of the
Poles. The Perſon thus imployed was one <hi>Ghiza,</hi>
a Poliſh Gentleman, formerly a Penſioner of
<hi>France.</hi> He was much addicted to the King's
Service, a Man of Intrigue of a good Wit, a
reſerved Humour, and fit for the Negotiations of
that Country. He had beſides ſome influence on
Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> having been acquainted with him
at the Univerſity, and in effect he confirmed him in
the King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Intereſt.</p>
               <p>He found with the Count a French Gentleman,
call'd the Count <hi>de Forval,</hi> who had obtained
great Credit in his Court, by the Natural Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and Agreement there was betwixt his and
<hi>Teckley</hi>'s Manners and Temper, being a lively
ſprightful pleaſant Man, Learned for a Perſon of
Quality, well acquainted with the World, could
Carrouze without being drunk, and was very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant
in purſuit of his Pleaſures, even to the
ruine of his Health. He came into <hi>Poland</hi> with
the Marquis <hi>de Bethune,</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> in
1675. and was ſent from thence on the King of
<hi>France</hi>'s Account to <hi>Teckley,</hi> whoſe Friendſhip he
knew how to acquire. After having ſerved as a
Colonel in the Auxiliary Troops, with which the
Count's Army was reinforced, he reſided with him
as a Miniſter, and had ſo far gained upon him by
his Wit and Converſation, that <hi>Teckley</hi> was willing
to retain him in his Court, by Marrying him with a
Counteſs, one of the Richeſt Heireſſes in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Count <hi>de Forval,</hi> before the Irruption of
the Turks, having returned to <hi>France,</hi> obtained
leave of the King to go and ſerve Count <hi>Teckley,</hi>
and went to him by way of <hi>Venice,</hi> thro' <hi>Boſnia</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:54820:34"/>
and arriving at <hi>Belgrade, Ghiza</hi> and he were much
ſurprized to meet one another there, having been
well acquainted before, when both imployed in
the French Service in <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During all this Management the Grand Viſier
aſſembled his Army at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> aſſembled the Emperor's near <hi>Comora</hi> and
<hi>Raab.</hi> He was joined by the Poliſh Troops in the
Emperor's Pay, commanded by the Chevalier
Prince <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> who had treated with them for
three Regiments. The Duke advanced afterwards
to the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> where he formed
the Siege of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> an important Place, the
furtheſt advanced of any belonging to the Turks,
about 8 Hungarian Leagues from <hi>Presburg,</hi> that
is to ſay 12 Hours March at leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſituated in a
vaſt Plain, Part of which is Marſhy, and Part of
it full of Ditches, and hollow Ways, but all of
it open and cultivated: It is bounded on one ſide
by an Arm of the <hi>Danube,</hi> to which another great
River joins called <hi>Waag,</hi> and on the other it has a
pleaſant Edge of little Hills, and altogether form
a charming Lantskip with conſiderable Towns,
frequent Villages, and generally a fruitful Soil.
The Town is ſmall, formerly built of Brick, with
with large Streets, pav'd in the Hungarian Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that is to ſay, with Borders raiſed like a
Caſway, with 6 Foot of Earth. It had ſtately
Churches, very Lofty Monaſtries and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Pallaces, amongſt others that of the Biſhop
of <hi>Nitra,</hi> Spiritual Lord of <hi>Neuhauſel,</hi> upon
which are ſtill to be ſeen the Arms of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
that built or repaired it. At preſent all
thoſe Houſes are in Ruines, where the Turks have
formed 'emſelves Habitations, without reſtoring the
Buildings, to which they have added other Houſes
made of Earth and Wood, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of that Nation, who never repair any thing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54820:34"/>
that they acquire. They have turned the Churches
into Moſques, the Palaces into Lodgings for their
Baſſas, and others of the firſt Rank. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
were given to the Soldiers of the Gariſon,
the reſt is inhabited by Merchants and Tradeſmen
of their own Nation and Way, for after <hi>Ahmet
Kuproli</hi> the Son took it, not ſo much as one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſtaid in the Town, but all of them retired
elſewhere.</p>
               <p>The Town is regularly fortified with 6 Royal
Baſtions, according to the Modern Way, faced
with Brick, well terraſſed, with a great Parapet
of Turf, betwixt which and the Wall there is a
very large Way. The Top of the Platform is
alſo very large. Each Baſtion hath a ſpacious
Cavalier capable of containing 500 Men, the
Streets of the Place end at the Avenues, and the
whole Circumference is very Eaſy and Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for giving Mutual Aſſiſtance to one another.
It hath only two Gates; they are well vaulted,
but have neither Ravelin nor Half-Moon, this
being only the Body of a Fortification, which the
Turks never ſuffered to be compleated. Nay, the
Ditches are not all throwly dug, and beyond 'em
there is the Draught of a Counterſcarp, which
ſhews the Ingineers deſign, ſo that all the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
remain about the Height of a Man, and
the Place hath no other Defence, but an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which fills the Ground deſigned for Ditches,
and leaves a little Space at the Foot of the Walls
in form of a <hi>Fauſſe Braye.</hi> This City had a little
Suburb going to the Gate that looks towards <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morra,</hi>
beyond the little River <hi>Nitra,</hi> with a
ſorry wooden Bridge after the Poliſh Manner,
which is not Unuſeful to cover this Front, tho' it
be the eaſieſt Part of the Town to attack by
drawing the Water from the Ditches, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it away by the River.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:54820:35"/>
As for the reſt, the City is encompaſſed with
marſhy Medows, through which there lie Cauſe-ways,
ſhaded with Trees, and admirable Gardens,
from whence, as alſo from the River <hi>Nitra,</hi> the
Turks had great Relief, there being no Water in
the Place. It was furniſhed with Cannon, Arms,
Powder and Proviſions for 2000 Foot and 800
Horſe, the uſual Gariſon, and defended by two
<hi>Pachas,</hi> the one being Governour called <hi>Aly,</hi> and the
other his Deputy called <hi>Muſtapha:</hi> The former
was about 60 Years of Age, of a good Aſpect,
with a venerable, large, grey Beard, and of more
than a middling Stature, of a melancholy Air,
lean Face, of a Carriage genteel enough, but
Ignorant to a Progidy, a great Hater of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and full of the fooliſh Vanity of the Turks,
who have a mighty Conceit of their own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Power. The other, on the contrary, was
a young Man of a good Countenanco, fair Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
pleaſant Look, full Face, of a cold
but eaſie Acceſs, a Noble Mien, and about 40
Years of Age. The Turks call this City <hi>Oiiy-War,</hi>
a Hungarian Word for Biſhops-Caſtle. After 'twas
taken by the Grand Viſier <hi>Kuproli,</hi> it was agreed,
that the Chriſtians might build another City in lieu
of it in the ſame Country; whereupon they ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<hi>Leopoldſtat,</hi> within 6 Leagues of it fortified
much in the ſame Manner.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had ſcarce begun his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
before <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> till he heard of the
March of the Infidels. But the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi>
whom he informed of it, being prepoſſeſſed with
contrary News, ordered him to continue the Siege,
ſince the Grand Viſier was ſtill at <hi>Belgrade.</hi> He
obeyed, and very narrowly eſcaped being ſwallowed
up by the Ottoman Army, having had much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to retire his own, and to throw them ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
into the Iſle of <hi>Comorra,</hi> commonly ſo call'd
from the famous Fortreſs at the oint of it, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54820:35"/>
properly called the <hi>Grand Schit,</hi> or Schut, by
which he ſav'd the Empire. That we may the
better underſtand the Importance of this Step, I
muſt inform you, that the Iſle of <hi>Schit,</hi> is one
of the fineſt in any River of <hi>Europe,</hi> begins near
<hi>Presburg,</hi> and lies along for the ſpace of 10 Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian
Leagues. On the Point oppoſite to the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
Couutry; as you go down the River, there's a
little City formerly walled, and ſtill a good Town,
called <hi>Comorra,</hi> covered with a Cittadel, that is
looked upon as Impregnable, and a Maſter-Piece
of the Art Military, both in regard of its Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betwixt two large Arms of the <hi>Danube,</hi> which
waſh its Flanks and join together at the Point of
its Baſtions, and in regard of its Fortifications and
Works. It hath one called <hi>Couronné</hi> in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Terms, whoſe Extent, Regularity and
Outworks are certainly comparable to the fineſt of
that kind, as is alſo the Eſplanade which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
it from the City, but the Body of the Place,
is nothing anſwerable. 'Tis an Irregular Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
becauſe in order to poſſeſs all the Ground of
the Point, they were forced to contract the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
towards the end, where there are little
Baſtions and narrow Curtains; but that Part is
well enough defended by the two Arms of the
<hi>Danube,</hi> and the height of the Ramparts. But
towards the City the Works have their full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
the Ditches, Half Moon, ſpace betwixt the
Glacis, and the Crowned Work anſwer very well
to the reſt, but thoſe who are verſed in Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
think the Defences too near, the Walls
too high, and the Flanks ill defended. I obſerved
one Irregularity here, which is a great eye-ſore,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Gate opens in the Corner of the
Curtain, almoſt touching the Baſtion on the Right,
and looks more like a Poſtern, than the Gate of
a Cittadel. It's alſo very ſtrait within, and the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54820:36"/>
Lodgings crowded too near together, which would
be hurtful to the Garriſon, if it were bombarded,
but three Days in the French Manner, but as for
the reſt, every thing there is very Magnificent,
and well covered, ſo that the Place being well
entertained might paſs for one of the beſt of the
kind. The Emperor has always two Governours
in this Place, the one a German and the other
an Hungarian according to the Priviledges of that
Kingdom, as at <hi>Raab</hi> and other principal Places.</p>
               <p>The Iſle of <hi>Schit</hi> hath ſome other Towns that
were formerly conſiderable, and well peopled, but
at preſent little frequented: There's abundance of
large Villages in it, and the whole is extraordinary
fruitful. It is one of the beſt Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and a Canton of an enchanted
Country, both in reſpect of its Beauty and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.
'Tis above 20 Leagues in Circumference,
and in ſome Places above 8 in Breadth, ſo that I
look upon it to be larger than <hi>Malta.</hi> Beyond
the <hi>Danube</hi> on both ſides, there is ſuch a Country
as cannot be expreſſed, boundleſs Plains watered
with other great Rivers that come to enlarge this
on the Right and Left, ſuch is the <hi>Raab,</hi> upon
which is ſettled the Town of that Name, call'd
otherwiſe <hi>Javarin,</hi> near which there's another
Iſland called <hi>Little Schit,</hi> by the ſide of the great
one; and the <hi>Nitra,</hi> which paſſes by <hi>Newhauſel,</hi>
and about 6 Leagues higher waſhes, a Town called
by its Name, beſides ſome others no leſs Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
               <p>'Twas into this Iſland the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
threw his Army on the approach of that of the
Turks, to ſecure this fine Country and the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
and to cover his Troops from the Enemy,
without which prudent Foreſight that prevented
the Grand Viſier, the Infidels had certainly ſeized it
on their arrival. They marched up the <hi>Danube</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:54820:36"/>
upon the Bank on the Right, having left on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide a great Body of Troops, under three Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas,
to augment the Hungarian Army, whoſe
General had Order to poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Presburg,</hi>
that they might be Maſters of both ſides the River, &amp;
to hinder the Conjunction of the Germans and
Poles, and block up the Way of the latter to
<hi>Vienna.</hi> It is alſo ſaid, that Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> when
he had ſeiſed <hi>Presburg,</hi> was to have made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
be crowned King of <hi>Hungary</hi> there, with the
ſame Enſigns of Royalty that their former Kings
uſed to be crowned with: but this is only a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
without Foundation.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this Army marches towards the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
aſſigned them, the Grand Viſier advances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Raab,</hi> with a Deſign to build Bridges over
the River of that Name, that he might paſs to
<hi>Vienna.</hi> He held, as the Pachas of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
me, a General Council upon this Great
Affair, and againſt the Opinion of all thoſe who
aſſiſted at it, would undertake the Siege of that
Capital City, without amuſing himſelf with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Expeditions. The Viſir of <hi>Buda</hi> repreſented to
him vigorouſly, the Difficulties of that Enterprize,
foretold him his bad Succeſs, and laid him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Neceſſity of taking the Event of the thing
upon himſelf, which did ſo much vex the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
General, that after his Misfortune he threw
the Blame upon the ſaid Viſier of <hi>Buda</hi> and the
Tartar Han, made the Head of the former to be
cut off, and the latter to be degraded. Upon
which thoſe Pachas bewailing the Misfortune of
their Nation, ſighed for the loſs of the Great
<hi>Kuproli,</hi> and bleſſed his Memory, remembring
with what docibility he asked the Opinion of old
Captains on the leaſt Occaſion: Whereas <hi>Kara
Muſtapha</hi> his Succeſſor, believed there was none
better than his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:54820:37"/>
He advanced, in fine, as far the Town of <hi>Raab,</hi>
which he made as if he would beſiege, and took
his Poſts round it, the better to amuſe the Duke
of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and that he might with more eaſe
ſurprize the Place, which he had only in his view.
<hi>Raab, Yavarin</hi> or <hi>Javarin,</hi> is one of the beſt Towns
of that Country, built in the ſame Form, and of
the ſame Size with <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> as to the Town,
but of a prodigous Extent, as to the Fortifications,
heaped one above another, all good Pieces of
Turf, and the Outworks admirable, but not fac'd.
'Tis ſcituated near that Branch of the <hi>Danube,</hi>
which forms the little Iſle of <hi>Schit,</hi> and hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its Walls the River of <hi>Raab,</hi> which falls
there into the <hi>Danube;</hi> ſo that it may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
as in the Point of a <hi>Penniſula,</hi> betwixt
thoſe two Canals. It hath two Governours, as the
Cittadel of <hi>Comorra,</hi> and a very conſiderable Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
poſſeſſed by the Cardinal <hi>de Kolonitz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grand Viſier encamped round it, as if he
would have beſieged it, and continued there ſeven
whole Days, during which he made three Bridges
to be laid over the River <hi>Raab,</hi> on the other ſide
of the City, about a quarter of a League above,
without Cannon ſhot of the Town, which he hid
from the beſieged, by ſeiſing himſelf of the Poſts
on the Neighbouring Hills, that ſurround it, ſo
that he miſſed very little of ſurprizing <hi>Vienna</hi>
unprovided, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> not having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that Deſign t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> very late, and the Emperor,
who continued there without any manner of Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion,
had ſcarce ſo much time left as to go out
of it: Nay further, the Tartars who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to go and and inveſt it, found the People
quietly reaping their Harveſt in the Fields, within
three or four Miles of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and Gentlemen
and Women travelling thro' the Country, as if
the Turks had been ſtill at <hi>Belgrade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Of thoſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54820:37"/>
unhappy People ſurprized on the Roads, I have
ſeen a great Number, and amongſt others Col-<hi>Roſemberg</hi>'s
Lady, who was carried to <hi>Boudziac,</hi>
and ranſomed two Years after, from whom I
knew this Circumſtance in <hi>Poland,</hi> whither ſhe
was conducted.</p>
               <p>The Grand Viſier paſſed the <hi>Raab</hi> unexpectedly,
as ſoon as his Bridges were finiſhed, and marched
with great Diligence. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> got
before him however, with the ſame Celerity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs
the Iſle of <hi>Comorra,</hi> and threw all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
commanded by Count <hi>Staremberg,</hi> into the
Iſland of <hi>Leopoldſtadt</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Vienna;</hi> and,
in fine, marched them opportunely into the Town
with the General, by the favour of thoſe Iſlands
through which he conducted them; ſo that the
Turks could never cut off their March. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
with the Cavalry ſome Days in <hi>Leopoldſtat,</hi>
but fearing to be ſhut up there, if Count <hi>Teckley</hi>
advanced on the other ſide of the River and entred
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> by the River <hi>Morave:</hi> He thought beſt
to retire from that Place, where he might be
ſtarved, or taken without ſtriking one Blow, being
locked up betwixt two Rivers and two Armies.
Thus he ſecured <hi>Vienna</hi> by his firſt March, and by
his next March he ſav'd the Remainder of the
Army, marching out of the Iſland by the great
Bridge, to which he ſet Fire, as ſoon as he paſſed
it. His foreſight herein was admirable, for ſcarce
had he reached the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> when
the Tartars ſent to inveſt <hi>Vienna,</hi> entred that ſame
Iſland by the ſmall Branch of the River, which
runs along by the Walls of the Town, and was at
that time fordable. They were followed by a
Body of <hi>Infantry,</hi> who marched ſtraight to the
Bridge that the Duke had cauſed to be burnt, and
whilſt he put that Great Exploit in Execution in
view of the Enemy, the Janiſaries made a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54820:38"/>
Fire upon him with their Muſquets of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Size, and entrenched themſelves upon
the Bank of the River in the Iſland, as having a
deſign to rebuild the Bridge, and indeed that was
the Grand Viſier's Deſign, to the end he might
have an Entrance into <hi>Auſtria</hi> on that ſide, and a
Communication with <hi>Teckley</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> and
that the Tartars by their Incurſions into <hi>Moravia</hi>
and <hi>Sileſia</hi> might ſtay the Poles in their own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and lay the Country under Contribution, as
far as <hi>Cracovia.</hi> Every thing ſeemed to favour this
Deſign, every thing was for them on the Way,
they had no River to paſs, being once over the
<hi>Danube,</hi> they had no Towns to take, no Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to paſs, no Forreſts to march thro', and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Proviſions every where in the Country,
which they might have carried to the Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Vienna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe Circumſtances ſet off the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>'s
Conduct in this March, with the greater
Luſtre, he having by thoſe Motions, ſaved both
<hi>Vienna</hi> and the Empire. The remaining part of
his Conduct was anſwerable, for in the following
Part of this Campagne, we ſhall find him put a
ſtop to the Enemies Projects, in two or three impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Rencounters, the ſucceſs of which would have
ſtoped the Paſſage of the Supplies. We come now
to ſee what happened upon the arrival of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
before the City.</p>
               <p>The Grand Viſier marched them with ſo much
diligence, that they appeared before the Town at
the very ſame Moment that the Emperor and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
went out at an oppoſite Gate, to make their
Eſcape to <hi>Lintz,</hi> without having time to carry
either Money or Jewels with them. Moſt of the
Lords of the Court left their Equipages behind
them. The Marquis <hi>de Seppeville,</hi> Envoy of
<hi>France,</hi> could not carry off his, and his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54820:38"/>
of the Horſe, ſtaid willingly behind to
take Care of it.—He was a Man of Valour,
proud of the Opportunity of being in a Siege of
that Importance, but was killed in a Salley. The
Biſhop of <hi>Gratz</hi> buried 400000 Crowns there,
that he could not carry off. All thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which appeared ſo afflicting at firſt, were
yet the true Cauſe of the Viſier's not taking the
Town, and that too from the ſame Motives that
ſhould ſeem to have made him haſten it. He was
informed of the Riches ſhut up within the City,
and fearing to loſe them during the Pillage, if his
Army took it by Aſſault, he moderated their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
and ſlackened their Attacks to oblige the
Town to come to a Capitulation, with which all
the Officers upbraided him, for by this means
he gave the King of <hi>Poland</hi> time to arrive, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
had he ſtaid but three Days longer he had come
too late.</p>
               <p>The Court being gone out of the City, the Gates
were ſhut, Cavalry was poſted in the Ditch, and
Skirmiſhers were detached to diſlodge the Platoons
of the Turks that had poſted themſelves on the
little Heights about the Town, ſo that ſeveral lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Fights happened at the beginning in ſight both
of the Army and City, which wanted not their
own uſe to confirm the Garriſons Courage, and
to accuſtom them to the Turbans and Scimiters.
But at laſt that innumerable Multitude of Troops,
having poſted themſelves about the Town, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
it in form of a Creſcent, beginning from
the Bank of the <hi>Danube,</hi> which the Turks had on
their Right, and extending as far as the Mountains
on the Left. The German Cavalry poſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on the Counterſcarp and in the Ditch, and
in the mean time the Tartars ravaged all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
for Forage, and extended 'emſelves more than
15 Leagues above <hi>Vienna</hi> towards <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54820:39"/>
obliged the Emperour, who thought himſelf not
ſafe enough at <hi>Lintz,</hi> where he juſt arrived time
enough to avoid being taken, to retire to <hi>Paſſaw.</hi>
The Particulars of this Flight are very afflicting.
The Court lay the firſt Night in a Wood, where
the Empreſs being ſix Months gone with Child,
could ſcarce have a little Straw to repoſe her
ſelf upon. I have ſeen a Relation of it wrote by
the Nuncio <hi>Bonviſi</hi> to the Nuncio <hi>Pallavicini</hi> in
<hi>Poland,</hi> which contained many ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaid, and am further to ſay concerning this
famous Expedition. It is neceſſary to lay down
a Plan of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and of the Turkiſh Camp and
Army. The City of <hi>Vienna</hi> being the Capital of
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> is ſcituated on an unequal Plain, being
cut with Riſing Grounds, hollow Ways, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Heights, watered by the River of <hi>Wien,</hi> which
gives Name to the City, runs within 100
Paces of the Counterſcarp, and nearer in ſome
Places, betwixt the Glacis of the Counterſcarp,
and a Suburb, into which we enter by two Stone-Bridges
of very little uſe during the Summer,
when that River is almoſt dry. Behind that Plain
towards <hi>Upper Auſtria,</hi> there riſes a Chain of
high Mountains, which begin at the <hi>Danube,</hi> and
extend thewſelves towards <hi>Styria</hi> and <hi>Tirol,</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
as a ſort of Rampart and Barrier to the Town,
which is covered by them. Thoſe Mountains de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
by Stages, like an Amphitheatre, to the very
Avenues of the Suburbs, being a vaſt Quantity of
little Hills rough and Stony, deep Pools occaſioned
betwixt them by Rain, the Aſcent of them ſteep,
and the Heights rugged. There's abundance of
Villages amongſt them, and concealed Houſes in
the Bottoms, and all round a vaſt Plantation of
Vines, which fills the Body of the Amphitheatre.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54820:39"/>
Upon the higheſt part of the Mountains, where
the Chain begins over the <hi>Danube,</hi> there are two
ſolid Buildings, each of them ſcituated upon a
ſteep Hill, and ſeparated by a Valley. The one
is a ruinous Caſtle, call'd <hi>Callenberg,</hi> and the other
a Chappel, dedicated to St. <hi>Leopold,</hi> from which
to the Suburbs of the City, there's a large half
German League of deſcent a croſs, thoſe lower
Hill, and above a League to the Glacis of the
Counterſcarp. The <hi>Danube</hi> waſhes one ſide of all
this Ground, and before the City forms diverſe
Iſlands, by the ſeveral Streams, which it throws
out to the Right and the Left, the leaſt and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt
of which touches the Walls at one end of
the City, where there is no other Ditch, only the
Body of the Place, and a very high Wall, which
covers the Entrance of the City, with a Street
betwixt both, the Canal of the River over which
there's a fine Bridge, ſerving inſtead of a Ditch
at that Point. The two other Arms which are
the largeſt, have each of them a Bridge, of very
good Workmanſhip for Timber, and maſſy, ſuch
as the Depth and Rapidity of the <hi>Danube</hi> requires.
Betwixt thoſe Canals there are ſeveral ſmall ones,
which cut the Iſlands, but don't properly make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Arms, being only Streams that proceed from
the Inundations of the River. The firſt of thoſe
Iſlands, and the neareſt to the City, is a ſecond
Town, as we may call it, the whole Place being
full of Country-houſes, Palaces, Gardens, great
Walks of Trees, as thoſe of the <hi>Cours le Reins,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures,
Thickets, Malls, and other things that
conduce to the Ornament of a Capital City: The
whole being incloſed like a Park, with high Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſadoes
of curious Workmanſhip. This is that
they call <hi>Leopolſtadt.</hi> From hence we enter the
City by a little Bridge, and a great Suburb beyond
it, that joins to the Houſes of the Iſland; in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54820:40"/>
which the Empreſs ſome few Years before had
cauſed a Palace to be built, call'd the <hi>New Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita,</hi>
which was the principal Beauty of the Iſland,
though, to ſpeak freely, all thoſe Houſes, Palaces
and Gardens have little Magnificence or Grandeur
in them, but the Place of it ſelf is very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
by Nature. The other Iſland beyond it,
betwixt the two great Branches of the River, is
greater than <hi>Leopoldſtadt,</hi> but without Houſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only adorned with Walks of Trees and Thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets:
'Tis called <hi>Tabor,</hi> and communicates with
the Firſt, by a large Bridge, as it does with the
<hi>Terra Firma</hi> upon the Auſtrian-ſhore by one yet
larger. This Canal is properly the great Stream
of the <hi>Danube.</hi> At the Head of this laſt Bridge,
there's a little Fort upon the Bank of the River,
built only with Turf and Palliſſados, which was
uſeful to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> favoured his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
and covered thoſe that ſuſtained the Party
commanded to deſtroy the Bridge. In all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which that Prince wrote to the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
about his Retreat, of all thoſe Iſlands, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
only the <hi>Tabor,</hi> as if he had confounded it
with that of <hi>Leopoldſtadt,</hi> but it is certain that he
poſſeſſed himſelf of the latter immediately, from
whence his Infantry marched to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and into
which the Tartars and Janiſſaries entred upon their
arrival; ſo that it was not poſſible for him to burn
the Bridge, which joins with thoſe two Iſlands.
Yet he left Coll. <hi>Greben</hi> there to defend it till he
marched his Troops over the <hi>Tabor,</hi> and gained
the other Bridge of the Great Canal: But
the Tartars ſeized it, defeated the Detachment and
took or killed Col. <hi>Greben,</hi> who was never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heard of. Then they run to the other, of
which the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had time to burn part,
and by that means ſaved the Remainder of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Army. Thoſe Bridges are now rebuilt, but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54820:40"/>
to me they don't ſeem to be in the ſame Place,
and the Road acroſs thoſe Iſlands appears to be
changed.</p>
               <p>The City is encompaſſed with large Suburbs,
which at that time extended very near the Glacis,
and to which the Imperialiſts had begun to ſet fire
to ſatifie, in ſome meaſure, the King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
and to ſhew ſome deference to his Advice, for the
Emperor thought there was no need of it; ſo that
they left in effect the Walls of the Houſes and the
Terraſſes of the Gardens, which the Turks made
uſe of to place their Batteries upon, and to make
their Approaches; ſo that under the Shelter of
thoſe Ruines they advanced their Trenches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
60 Paces of the Counterſcarp, the firſt Night
that they opened them, which was the 13th of
<hi>July,</hi> 1683. This fatal Experience hath ſince oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
them to remove the Suburbs at a greater
diſtance, when they began to rebuild them after
the Siege. As to the Fortifications ſome of them
are ſtrong and others weak. There are 12 Royal
Baſtions, faced with Brick, with Cavaliers, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velins,
Half-Moons, and fine Gates, all fac'd with
Bricks, as the Baſtions, and adorn'd with Wreaths of
hewn Stone. The Ditch is large and deep, part of
of it dry and part full of Water. The Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp
is very ſorry, ill palliſſadod, nor did I ſee any
thing that deſerved to be called a <hi>Covert-Way,</hi> or
any detached Works beyond it. The ſide on which
the Town was attack'd, hath two indifferent Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
a Ravelin before the Courtin betwixt both,
the whole covered with Brick, with a Cavalier or
Platform for Guns, and a large Ditch, but ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Ground within, and ſo little ſpace betwixt the
Rampart and the Houſes, that there could be no
Retrenchment made on it; particularly the Baſtion
of the Court, the Emperor's Palace, joining cloſe
to it, and the Platform of it ſerving inſtead of a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54820:41"/>
Terraſſe for the Appartments; ſo that when the
Turks were lodg'd at the Point of it. The Count
<hi>de Staremberg</hi> could not make any more than one
Retrenchment, and told the King of <hi>Poland</hi> when
he ſhewed him the Breaches, that he could not
have held out above three Days longer, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
certain Barricadoes he had made at the
entrance of the Baſtion, and of the Streets which
run into it; but I am of Opinion, as were all
thoſe who ſaw the Diſpoſition of the Ground, that
it might have bin carried in 24 Hours. If the Grand
Viſier, had not deſpiſed our Supplies, been leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon the ſpoil of the Town, and on the
Evening before the Battle attack'd the weak Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
of the Garriſon, for all Ingineers
agree, that he began the Siege like an able Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and one that was well informed of the weak
Places of the Town, and that there is no other
Place for carrying on of Trenches, but thoſe of
the two Baſtions attack'd by the Turks, called
the Baſtions of the <hi>Lyon,</hi> and of the <hi>Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Condition of the Place without,
that within was not ill, there being great Stores of
Proviſions and Ammunition, abundance of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
the Citizens reſolved on a long Reſiſtance, and
vigorouſly to endure the fatigues of the Siege. There
was a numerous Gariſon, for Count <hi>Staremberg</hi>
brought thither above 1000 Men, and was alſo
ſeconded by Count <hi>Caplier,</hi> Commiſſary General
of the Proviſions, who defended the Place
longer than the other, that fell ſick of a Dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
during the Siege. But notwithſtanding all this
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was very much afraid of the
Town, and amongſt other Reaſons he wrote to the
King of <hi>Poland</hi> at the beginning of the Siege,
he acquainted him, <hi>That</hi> Vienna, <hi>though well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with Baſtions, ought to be looked upon to be
more a Courtly than a Warlike City, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54820:41"/>
in Works, and a regular Counterſcarp, that
which they had not being large enough in ſeveral
Places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be owned alſo, That it was very ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and as feebly attacked, ſince the Turks
having advanced the firſt Night within 60 Paces
of the Ditch, were notwithſtanding above ſix
Weeks in paſſing it, though the Place was batter'd
with ſeventy Pieces of Cannon, of which there
were twenty five of a prodigious Size, and the
Gariſon made no great Sallies, but contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to defend their Ground foot by foot in the
common Manner. I ſaw nothing in reality in all the
Letters from the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and Prince of
<hi>Tranſylvania</hi> to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> that took any
great Notice of the Vigor of the Garifon, who
undertook nothing extraordinary, but only ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Enemies Aſſaults with Bravery, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
having continued a long time in the Ditch,
without making any attack, either on the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or Trenches. The Turks on their ſide did
not puſh on the Attacks with vigor, ſo that the
City, which ought to have been in Ruins by Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
and Bombs, was very intire, thoſe Places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
that were directly expoſed to the Batteries.
I neither ſaw Steeples beat down, nor many
Houſes ſhattered, and much fewer burnt, which
confirms the Opinion of the Pachas, that the
Grand Viſier ſpar'd, that City for his own Intereſt,
whilſt, by a quite contrary and ill underſtood Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
he utterly ruined all the Neighbourhood, as
far as from <hi>Presberg</hi> to 5 or 6 Leagues up the <hi>Danube</hi>
beyond <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Tartars in effect left furious
Marks of their Rage and Cruelty in thoſe Parts
for they not only depopulated thoſe Countries, but
quite deſtroyed all the Houſes, except one Caſtle
belonging to the Emperor, which is within a ſmall
League of <hi>Vienna,</hi> upon the great Road to <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54820:42"/>
where the Turks laid up their Magazins,
and which the Grand Viſier preſerved out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the Memory of the Great <hi>Soliman,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that Emperor, having formerly encamped
upon that Ground, when he beſieged the ſame
Place. The Germans built an Houſe there, with
a Park, incloſed with Stone-Walls, flankd with
little Towers, looking like Pavillions, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Form and Diſpoſition of the Sultans Tents,
whoſe Quarter was built by way of a Palace or
Seraglio.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are verſed in War could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Reaſons of the Grand Viſier, who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any neceſſity, thus ruined a fine Country of
the Conqeſt whereof he aſſured himſelf and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to have made it his Reſidence: Beſides that
in ravaging behind him, he not only ſtarved his
own Camp, but alſo cut off all Poſſibility of
Subſiſtance, in his retreat, in caſe of any Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
whilſt at the ſame time he ſpar'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
on his left-hand towards <hi>Newſtadt,</hi> and the
Mountains of <hi>Styria,</hi> where the Tartars had
ſcarcely ever touched. He had pitched his Camp
from the Brinks of the <hi>Danube;</hi> which incloſed
his right Wing, to the Foot of the next little
Hills, where the Vineyard was, taking up a vaſt
Tract of Ground, in Form of a Half-Moon; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that the very ſight of it was formidable.
The Tartars had advanced further, having paſſed
the firſt Arm of the River, and poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the Iſles over-againſt the Place: On the
firſt of which there was an Attack, with a Battery
of only ſix Pieces of Cannon, pointed along the
Streets of the Suburbs, againſt a Baſtion on the
outſide, which is waſhed by the little Stream of the
<hi>Danube.</hi> This took up the width of the whole
Street, and could be nothing but a falſe Attack,
to fatigue the Gariſon; for its Works were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54820:42"/>
though that Arm of the River was not
only fordable but very ſhallow in that Place.
The other two Approaches were towards the
middle of the Camp, full of irregular Cutts,
Turnings and VVindings, after the Turkiſh Faſhion,
with frequent Places of Arms, all well covered and
guarded, the Trenches being deep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
raiſed high; beſides which, the laborious Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries
had made ſeveral Holes like Huts to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
themſelves from the Granado's, Firepots and
Bombs; as for Stones they did no hurt there. In
a word, all that could be thought of for ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Trench, and covering a Battery was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
here. No Body ever ſaw ſuch fine VVorks
and Gabions, nor ſo many Faſcines and Sacks of
Earth, particularly on the Brink of the Ditch,
from whence they defended the Lodgments made
upon the two Baſtions.</p>
               <p>The Grand Viſier had taken up his Quarters
upon certain little Heights, near that renowned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
called the <hi>Favorita,</hi> which he incloſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Park; the extent whereof was prodigious:
I have heard the King compare it to the largeneſs
of the City of <hi>VVarſaw.</hi> He had added Gardens,
VVater-Courſes and other Imbeliſhments to it, and
alſo a ſort of a Menagery; for after the Siege
was raiſed, ſeveral Rabbets, live Pidgeons, and
the Body of the fineſt feathered Oſtridge that ever
was ſeen, whoſe Head the Viſier's Party had cut
off as they retired, were found there. He was a
Man who loved his Pleaſures, and Magnificence
in all things, mixing them always with a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of VVar. The Cares of that Siege did
not debar him of his Divertiſements, nor interrupt
his Amours. And I know that the Mufti, who
accompanied him in that famous Expedition, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
reproached him with his brutal Debaucheries,
threatning him with the Vengeance of God, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54820:43"/>
Forewarning him, as by a Spirit of Prophecy, that
his infamous Commerce with Boys (which the
Turks as well as Chriſtians, are forbid under very
ſevere Penalties) would be the Cauſe of the ruin
of the Empire, and of his ill ſucceſs in that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
               <p>He had little reaſon to fear it humanly ſpeaking,
for the Ottoman Empire had never aſſembled ſo
vaſt an Army, nor ſo many Pioneers at once, nor
gathered together ſuch vaſt Quantities of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
and Artillery. The Camp was an entire
VVorld, as one may ſay. I have heard ſome Turks,
who pretended not to exagerate when they ſaid,
That it conſiſted of ſeven hundred thouſand Men,
including regular Troops, Pioneers, Artificers, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks
and ſuch as compoſed the Trains of the
Officers.—VVhen we arrived to the
top of Mount <hi>Callemberg,</hi> and firſt ſaw them, we
were ſtruck with Fear and Admiration, at the ſame
time, which we could not avoid, at the ſight of
ſo many Men, and ſuch great Riches, agreeable to
the Grandeur and Puiſſance of the Grand Senior:
But the terror wherewith we were ſeized over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
our Admiration; when the King asked
one of his Gentlemen, who advanced to the top
of the higheſt Mountain, to view them, and
bring ſome News of them, he gave ſo terrible a
Deſcription of them, that the whole Army trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at it; which that great Monarch ſeeing, and
fearing leſt ſuch a Prepoſſeſſion might diſcourage
the Army, he openly derided the Gentleman's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
calling it a <hi>Coward's Viſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but when the
Buſineſs was over, being himſelf amazed at his
good Succeſs, he confeſſed, that he had Reaſon
to ſpeak of it, as he had done, and that his Fear
was very well grounded.</p>
               <p>Amongſt this prodigious Number of People,
which I have ſpoke of, 'twas computed that there
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54820:43"/>
were nigh 300000 fighting Men, without inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Tartars, and other Auxiliary Troops, as
Walachians, Moldavians, Tranſylvanians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
according to the juſt Relation of an Envoy from
Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> who afterwards followed the King
of <hi>Poland</hi> to <hi>Cracow,</hi> that Number was reduced
to an hundred and ſixty thouſand effective Turks,
whereof 22000 Men were at that time killed,
(being in the Month of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>) The Grand Viſier
depending upon his formidable ſtrength, marched
as if it had been to a Triumph, and had carryed
the Reſidents of the Emperor and of the King of
<hi>Poland,</hi> chained as Captives, to be witneſſes of the
ſame, the former was found in that Condition,
in the Camp, after the Flight of the Turks, who
had forgot him there. I determine nothing about
the preciſe Number of this prodigious Multitude
of Troops, and paſs over the divers Relations that
have been made of this great Affair. I tell in a
Hiſtorical manner what I know from the Original,
recommending the Reader to judge of the thing
upon two Circumſtances; one of which is, that
next Morning after the Battle there were remaining
at ten of the Clock, twenty five thouſand ſmall
Tents, after a whole Nights plunder, which began
about 7 in the Evening: If the Turks put 4 Men
in each Tent, as we do, 'tis eaſie to draw a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
from thence. The other Circumſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the Tartars, who have no Tents; beſides
theſe a great many were ſcattered in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Iſlands, the Grand Viſier had left ten
thouſand Men to guard his Bridges upon the <hi>Raab,</hi>
to hinder the Gariſon of that Place from burning
them; and beſides all this the Sultan, who was
advanced to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> to encourage the Expedition,
had ſent him, towards the end of the Siege, a
Reinforcement of twenty thouſand Men, in the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54820:44"/>
Room of thoſe that might be killed or dead; but
they did not arrive in time.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he batters the Place with a terrible fury,
Count <hi>Teckley</hi> advances through <hi>Hungary</hi> to <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
with another Body of about twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men, Hungarians and Turks, the latter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by three Baſſas. He had brought over al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all that Kingdom to his Party, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of the Grand Viſier augmented the Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which thoſe who ſtill adher'd to the Emperor,
had for a Revolt: Thus the Town of <hi>Comorra</hi>
was burnt by the Rebbels, under the favour of this
Irruption; and that of <hi>Presburg</hi> opened its Gates
to Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> and received a Turkiſh Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of about three hundred Men. The Grand
Viſier, being informed of its Surrender, ſent ſome
Troops thither, with Orders to lay a Bridge over
the <hi>Danube,</hi> to the end that the Tartars or ſome
Turkiſh Cavalry might paſs over the ſame, from
his Camp before <hi>Vienna,</hi> into that other part
of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Moravia,</hi> in order to
ſhut up the Paſſage of the Succours expected from
<hi>Poland.</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the Surrender of <hi>Presburg,</hi> and fearing
what the Viſier had projected as to a Bridge, he
advanced in great Diligence thitherwards, with
the reſt of the Imperial Army, which ſince its
March out of the Iſlands of <hi>Leopoldſtadt</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi>
moved up and down the Plains on the other
ſide the <hi>Danube,</hi> along the Roads where the Troops
of the Allies were to come. He carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
his March, and ſlipt during the Darkneſs
of the Night, into the Thickets and Vineyards
above <hi>Presburg,</hi> from whence he ſent ſome Horſe
by break of Day, with Orders to approach the
Caſtle, and to ſee whether 'twas ſtill in the hands
of the Germans, to the end he might put ſome
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54820:44"/>
Troops into the ſame, and afterwards force the
Town to return to the Obedience of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Presburg,</hi> the Capital of the Kingdom of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
Reſidence of the Governour General, call'd
<hi>Palatin,</hi> and the Place where the States aſſemble,
for the Election and Coronation of their Kings,
was formerly a conſiderable City, and an Ancient
Roman Colony, founded by <hi>Piſo,</hi> from whence
comes the Latin Denomination of <hi>Poſonium,</hi> which
the Turks and Hungarians have corrupted to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
It has only been the Capital of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſince the Turks took <hi>Buda,</hi> which before that
time was the Reſidence of the Kings of <hi>Hungary,</hi>
whoſe Palace is yet to be ſeen, at leaſt Part of
that which King <hi>Matthias</hi> cauſed to be built there,
and called by his own Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Presburg</hi> is ſcituated upon the left-hand Branch
of the <hi>Danube,</hi> incloſed within a Chain of little
Hills, covered with Vineyards, and the Channel
of the River, which is very broad there, and
waſhes its Walls. Upon one of thoſe riſing
Heights, near the City, is a Caſtle, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a Noblemans Houſe, which in reality is
very large, in Form of a Square, but all intire:
It is covered by a Modern Fortification, with ſome
Works at a diſtance upon the brow of the Hill,
on that ſide which commands the City. The
Town is only girt with a ſingle Wall, flanked
with great Towers of Stone, and a covered Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
ſufficient to ſtop an Army for ſome Days;
The Gates are very broad, but the Ditch is
narrow and not very deep. 'Tis not very conſiderable
within; there are ſome Fountains in it, ſeveral
Churches pretty well built, ſome Squares, but
ſmall and huddled up, there's a great many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Town, and extraordinary plenty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions;
and above all of admirable Fruit. I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54820:45"/>
have heard the King of <hi>Poland</hi> expreſs his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at this Plenty, as the Product of a fortunate
Country, and of a Climate cheriſhed by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
which ought not to ſurprize us, for he ſpoke
without doubt in Compariſon of that from whence
he came, where Nature overwhelmed with Snow,
produceth nothing that is delicious; though, to
ſpeak the Truth, there are few Countries in
the World, better than the Kingdom of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notice being given to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> by
his Men, that the Caſtle of <hi>Presburg</hi> held out
ſtill, he advanced thither with his Troops, and
ſummoned the Town, which delayed its Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Emperor only to gain time for the
Turkiſh Gariſon to march out at an oppoſite
Gate, and to give 'em leaſure to regain Count
<hi>Teckley</hi>'s Camp, which was pitched upon a
riſing Ground, about a quarter of a League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it. This ſtep broke all the Meaſures of the
Grand Viſier for building his Bridge; for which
all the Materials were already got together in the
Town. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> did not content
himſelf with having retaken the Town, but went
in queſt of the Enemy on the other ſide, who
boldly offered him Battel, and bore the Shock
with Vigor; But at laſt were broke by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts,
and preſſed upon, in their Retreat, by the
Poliſh Troops under the command of Prince <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomirski</hi>
who ſignalized themſelves on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having afterwards
given neceſſary Orders for the Security of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
he repaſſed the <hi>Morave,</hi> foarding it as he
had done before when he went thither and pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Camp at <hi>Levenſtorf,</hi> in the ſame Plains,
where he had not been long, till he ſaw
the Enemy again. <hi>Anchar,</hi> one of Count <hi>Teck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eutenants, returned with a great Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54820:45"/>
of Hungarian Troops, and paſſed the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rave</hi>
burning wherever he came, and ravaging
the fineſt Country in all <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The Duke
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being informed of this by the Spies
belonging to the Poliſh Troops, could not refuſe
Prince <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> who commanded them, the
Glory of Fighting thoſe Rebels, with the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their own Nation only, and the ſaid
Prince having obtained leave for that purpoſe, led
on his Men with extraordinary Vigor, and obtained
an entire Victory, without giving the Enemy time
to rally. The Detachment was cut to pieces, and
<hi>Anchar</hi> himſelf was killed by a Dart, thrown by a
Kettle-Drummer of the Regiment of <hi>Pancernes.</hi>
This Action was much valued by the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> in whoſe ſight it was done. He wrote a
Letter about it to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and in the
ſame did particular Juſtice to their General. Pr.
<hi>Lubomirski</hi> is certainly one of the braveſt Men of
his Age, being all Fire, and having all the vigor
that can be deſired for a brisk Expedition; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes
Danger, is without Fear, a good Partiſan,
a Lover of War, but eſpecially of Battles, deſires
always to be charging the Enemy, as all brave Men
do, who are not anſwerable for the Event of an
Action. The like Deſire of Glory excited him to
ingage in the Battle of <hi>Jurafno,</hi> in the Year 1676.
where he gave marks of an extraordinary Valor,
which he alſo had Occaſion for, to make amends
for the Fault he had committed by hazarding, in
this Rencounter; the whole Poliſh Army, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the King's Perſon, and without a certain
preſence of Mind, which accompanied his Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
he would have found great Difficulty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage
him.</p>
               <p>After the Defeat of the Hungarians near the
<hi>Morave</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> marched back to the
<hi>Danube,</hi> towards that Place, where he had paſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54820:46"/>
the ſame, in order to endeavour to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the State of the Siege. He endeavoured di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
times to throw in ſome Troops, by the way
of the River, and otherwiſe, but found all the
Avenues ſhut up, and carefully guarded; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that during the Siege, it was impoſſible for
him to inform the Governor of the Relief that
was preparing for him: And on the other hand,
the Governour could not ſend any Body to the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> but once a Jew, in diſguiſe,
who deceived the vigilance of the Turks, by tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
three or four Days in their Camp; wherein
the exactneſs of the Officers may be admired, and
particularly that of the Viſier, who ſhut up <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi>
ſo cloſe, as not to leave the leaſt Paſſage for
the Imperialiſts, unleſs it were through the Air.
He had ſhut up the little Channel of the <hi>Danube</hi>
above the City, and beſides it was ſo low that Year,
that one could not ſwim under Water. If the
whole Conduct of this Ottoman General had been
equal to thoſe Precautions, perhaps the King of
<hi>Poland</hi> would have met with greater Difficulties
in ſuccouring the Place. But in the main, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unpardonable Faults, being ill informed
of the Marches of the Chriſtians, careleſs in ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up, and guarding the Paſſes, and being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to doubt of the arrival of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
he ſuffered a Bridge of above two hundred and
fifty Paces, to be made over a very rapid River,
and permitted the Chriſtian Army to march over
ſteep Mountains, where ſome little Detachments
of Foot might have ſtopt or at leaſt much incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
their March. He neglected to poſſeſs himſelf
of thoſe Mountains, and to ſeize the two Forts,
that I have ſpoken of, which were very important
Poſts to hinder their Deſcent towards <hi>Vienna,</hi> and
he wanted little of letting the King of <hi>Poland</hi> fall
upon him, without coming out of his Camp;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54820:46"/>
all out of a vain Preſumption and extraordinary
Contempt he had of the Poliſh Army. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
of his Miſtakes was his beſieging <hi>Vienna;</hi> for
it is certain, that if he had ſat down before <hi>Raab</hi>
or <hi>Comorra,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland</hi> would not have
gone in Perſon to their Succour, though they be
Places of very great Importance, he not being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to it by the Treaty, nor having promiſed
the Pope any thing, but for <hi>Vienna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt he preſs'd the Town by his frequent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who incamped at
<hi>Clauſter Neyburg,</hi> near the <hi>Danube,</hi> waited with
Impatience for the arrival of the Poliſh Army,
and gave Orders for augmenting that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
which was joined by the Princes and their
Troops from all Parts of the Empire. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Saxony</hi> brought ten thouſand four hundred
Men thither: The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſent almoſt
as many, and ſoon after followed them in Perſon:
Count <hi>VValdeck</hi> conducted the Troops of the
Circles thither. The Elector of <hi>Branderburg</hi> did
not make ſuch haſte, he would firſt have certain
Fiefs, which the Emperor was obliged to ſell him
for the Overplus of the Troops, that he was to
furniſh, beſides his <hi>Quota;</hi> ſo that that Body was
but juſt entred <hi>Sileſia,</hi> when the News of the
raiſing of the Siege paſt through that Country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carryed to <hi>Cracow,</hi> where the Queen of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was. On the other ſide, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
was buſie getting together Materials for building
a Bridge, expecting that the King would deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Place where he deſigned to paſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and in the mean time the Grand Viſier cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a great Number of Tartars and Turks to paſs
the River, ſome by ſwimming and others in Boats,
who joining Count <hi>Teckley</hi>'s Army, formed a Camp
in the Plains beyond the <hi>Danube,</hi> not far from
that of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who advanced to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54820:47"/>
give them Battle. Both Army's diſpoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for Fighting. The Duke drew up his in three
Lines, putting the Poliſh Regiments in the firſt,
and made the Emperor's Cuiraſſiers and Dragoons
to ſupport the whole. The Turks charged with
ſo much violence and fury, that they broke the
firſt Ranks, preſſed in upon the Polanders, knock'd
down all that ſtood againſt them, and pierced
through to the laſt Line, where the Count <hi>de
Boutlaer</hi> was wounded in the Head, with as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
a cut of a Scimiter, as could be received
without Death. The Germans ſeeing this Diſorder,
opened very diſcreetly to the Right and Left, that
the broken Troops might paſs, and having born
all the fury of the Turks, and ſtop'd their Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity
by the firmneſs of the Squadrons of Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſiers,
the Dragoons of the third Line, received
the Enemy without firing, charged them in their
turn, preſſed in upon them, and the Polanders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
returned from their firſt Diſorder, and having
rallyed, ſeconded thoſe brave Men ſo well that
the whole Turkiſh Army was defeated and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
to the <hi>Danube,</hi> where the Baſſa of <hi>VVarradin</hi>
fell a ſwimming through a Shower of Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot,
truſting to the ſtrength of his Horſe, which
actually carried him over to the other ſide in ſight
of every Body. This Battle was fought on St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi>'s
Day 1683. and was the laſt Action that
happened in thoſe Plains, where the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
being Maſter of the Field, ſaved that part of
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> with thoſe Parts of <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Sileſia</hi>
that adjoyn to it, by his good Conduct. The
People there were in continual Alarms, they had
barricadoed all their Ways, thrown up Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
before their Town-Gates, and armed all the
Inhabitants of their Cities. In a Word, all was in a
Conſternation as far as <hi>Breſlaw.</hi>

reckoned to be about forty Leagues from <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf;</hi>

the Queen had made a Vow at her lying in,

               <p>From <hi>Villaneuf</hi> he went to <hi>Falenta,</hi> a fine Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-Houſe,
about a League from thence, where
he tarryed that Day. The third Day he had Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
at <hi>Nadazzin,</hi> where he dined, of the raiſing
of the Siege of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> and the Retreat of

adorned with a fine Garden, with ſeveral Water-Works,
Terras-Walks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therein; and, which
is very rare in <hi>Poland,</hi> furniſhed pretty neatly.
Next Morning the Court arrived at <hi>Chenſtokova,</hi>
where the King tarryed to perform his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
There he diſpatched ſome Courriers to the
Emperor and Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had ſent a
Poliſh Gentleman, called <hi>Glinski,</hi> an Officer under

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54820:48"/>
of the Turks before <hi>Vienna,</hi> which they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.
The King of <hi>Poland</hi> wrote upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to other Courts to excite the Compaſſion of
the Princes in favour of the Emperor, who was
chaſed from his Capital City, and upon the very
brink of ſeeing himſelf ſtript of all his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
then continued his march and arrived at laſt
at <hi>Cracow,</hi> at a Pleaſure-Houſe which the Kings
of <hi>Poland</hi> have at the end of one of the Suburbs
called <hi>Lobzouf,</hi> where he ſtaid ſome Days.</p>
               <p>In the mean time his Troops advanced towards
the ſame Place, and ſome ſmall Parties of them
paſſed by every Day. Lieutenant General <hi>Schig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nafski</hi>
came no nearer than within two Leagues
with his Body of Cavalry, which the King went
to ſee upon the Road, and ordered them to march
by the Foot of the Mountains on the left-hand,
that they might not fall into the Road, marked
out for the Grand Army, which was to the
Right, the General Rendezvous of which was to
be at <hi>Tarnovitz,</hi> the firſt City of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and of

General, who was ſent <hi>per</hi> Poſt to repreſent,
that the danger was Preſſing, arrived two Hours
before the Court. The fight of the Camp gave
him ſome hopes, but he could not yet believe,
that the King was there, he being prepoſſeſſed,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54820:49"/>
as was the whole Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> and ſeveral
others, that that Prince would never go out of
his Dominions; inſomuch that when the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>d'Arquyan,</hi> who was the firſt that viſited him
at Dinner, told him that the King was juſt coming;

the King's Part, that the Poliſh Troops ſhould
commit no Diſorders in <hi>Hungary,</hi> particularly on
Count <hi>Teckley</hi>'s Land; and on the Counts part,
that his ſhould not come near <hi>Cracow,</hi> as I have
already ſaid; to which I muſt add, what I have
heard from the King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s own Mouth to
<hi>Ghiia,</hi> when he took his Leave of him, <hi>viz.</hi> That
he muſt aſſure Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> that if the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
ſhould burn one Straw in the Territories
of <hi>Poland,</hi> he would go in Perſon and burn his
Wife and Children in his own Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had daily given the King
of <hi>Poland</hi> an exact Account of the State of the
Siege, by frequent Courriers; and Count <hi>Caraffa</hi>
gave him a full and the laſt Account of it whilſt
he was at Dinner at <hi>Bengin,</hi> as likewiſe of the
State of the Imperial Army, which was given out
to be 14000 Horſe and 30000 Foot: Whereupon
his Poliſh Majeſty opened his mind to that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and diſcovered to him the Deſign he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
to attack the Turks by way of the Mountains
of <hi>Callemberg,</hi> which he deſcribed to him in the
Camp; and from that Day I obſerved in the K. a
Prophetick Aſſurance of his beating them, which
the Event has always made me to take for a Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial
Inſpiration. <hi>Caraffa</hi> at the ſame time told him
how that the Imperial Court had been obliged, in
flying from <hi>Vienna,</hi> to leave in the Place a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Treaſure, in Money and Jewels, the loſs
of which would be no ſmall addition to their
Grief; and conjured him by all theſe Motives to
haſten his March, whereof he would be aſſured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he returned. In a Word, he followed the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54820:50"/>
Court of <hi>Poland</hi> to <hi>Tarnovitz,</hi> and after having
ſeen the Review of the Army, and taken his Leave
of the King and Queen, he took Poſt, having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Horſes to follow him, on purpoſe that he might
be able to aſſure the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that he had
ſeen them on their March, for no Body ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that the K. would have led them in Perſon.</p>
               <p>He arrived on the 21ſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at <hi>Tarnovitz,</hi>
in the Neighbourhood of which Place the Army
incamped that Day in many ſeparate Camps,
which the King cauſed to be done, that it might
appear to be the greater, not only to the Imperial
Commiſſaries, but alſo to an extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the Nobility of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> who flocked thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſee this famous King, from whom the
Deliverance of the Empire was expected. They
were ſupplied with Proviſions in abundance, the
Poliſh Money paſt Currant, Waggons were given to
the Infantry to haſten their March; and others got
ready for the Coſſacks, who were impatiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by the King; in fine, all imaginable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of diſpatch were formed out, with ſuch ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs
as the preſſingneſs of the Occaſion did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>require.
Upon which, I find my ſelf obliged
to obſerve, that the Lithuanians have ſo bad a
Name for pillaging and other diſorders in their
Marches, that the Imperial Commiſſaries prayed
the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to divert that Plague from off
their Country, and to cauſe 'em to march over the
Mountains of <hi>Hungary;</hi> which way they actually
took, and failed not to burn, plunder, kill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo
that the way they went might be diſcover'd by their
terrible Diſorders; of which C. <hi>Teckley,</hi> who was
aſſured by the King himſelf of a kind Neutrality
between the Territories of <hi>Poland</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
depending on him, teſtified a great Reſentment.
All the Blame was laid upon the Lithuanian Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and upon a Gent. of that Country call'd <hi>Teski<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evits,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:54820:50"/>
to whom the Q. had given the Conduct of
certain Troops, made up of ſtragling Men, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Army of the great Dutchy of <hi>Lithuania,</hi>
as if they had been their Retinue.</p>
               <p>The 22d of <hi>Aug.</hi> the K. after Maſs, went into the
Camp in a Warriors Equipage, having the <hi>Bont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chouk</hi>
carried before him, preceded by his Guards
and Horſes of War, whoſe Harneſſes were glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Gold and precious Stones, and, without
Exageration, with ſuch a Richneſs, as I never ſaw
elſewhere, or perhaps 'tis not valued but amongſt
thoſe ſorts of Nations, as Turks, Perſians, and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,
whoſe Pomp and Methods the Polanders
imitate. The K. had ordered his Infantry to break
up before Day the better to conceal from the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
the ſmallneſs of their Number, and the bad
Condition they were in. The Artillery which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
of 28 Pieces of very ſmall ſize, followed the
firſt Day for the ſame reaſon; for except 5 or 6
Cannon of a reaſonable ſize, for Field-Pieces, the
reſt did not deſerve that Name. He would not
therefore review any other but the Poliſh Cavalry
and Dragoons, which were truly extraordinary fine
Troops, all equipped as the beſt Regiments of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
which charmed the Imperial Commiſſaries.
The Grand General drew them up in Battalia, and
the Princes and Senators, who had Troops of <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi>
among them, having poſted themſelves at their
Head, the King made a Review of them, and at
the ſame time marched at the Head of all in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not trouble my ſelf here with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Deſcription of the Places along this Road,
nor with the Incampments of the Poles during this
March; I ſhall do it at length at the end of my
Narrative, that I may not break the Thread of my
Diſcourſe; and ſhall content my ſelf at preſent
to inform the Publick, that the King from that very
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54820:51"/>
Day quitted his Army, in order to put himſelf
with all Expedition at the Head of that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
where every Body wanted his Preſence, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with him only a Body of 4000 Horſe, and a
Detachment of twenty Huſſars out of each Troop,
who were inſtead of his Guards, and marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Perſon without Lances: He wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Pope from <hi>Ratibor,</hi> to inform him of
his haſty March with that Detachment: He
lodged in moſt of the Towns where they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Lodgings for his Reception; in others he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
with his Guards. No Monarch ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſo much reſpectful Homage from People of
a Foreign Dominion, as the King of <hi>Poland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the Emperor's Subjects.</p>
               <p>He marched through all <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and croſs'd the
Mountains (being ſeven Leagues over) that part
it from <hi>Moravia.</hi> He went through this laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and was treated by the old Archbiſhop of
<hi>Strigonia</hi> in the Town of <hi>Brin,</hi> which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Place in that Country, that can be called ſtrong,
becauſe of its Cittadel, that the Natives reckon
to be impregnable. In fine, leaving the Plains of
<hi>Auſtria</hi> on his left Hand towards <hi>Ekendorf,</hi> he
marched to <hi>Olle Brun,</hi> where he incamped on the
31ſt of <hi>Aug.</hi> The ſame Day the little General of
the Crown joined the King, in his March with the
Body of Cavalry, which he had conducted by the
Foot of the Mountains; and the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
arrived juſt as his Poliſh Majeſty was cauſing
thoſe Troops to defile. Thus their firſt Interview
was in the open Field; the King received him at
the Head of thoſe Troops drawn up, in order of
Battle, whoſe fierce Aſpect did excellently well
ſuit with the Noble and Warlike Air of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.
The Duke lighted off his Horſe at about
25 Paces diſtance from the King, who did the
ſame at about 15, and after a ſhort Converſation,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54820:51"/>
but very Affectionate, on both ſides, both of them
mounted again at the ſame time, and went together
to the Camp, that was marked out at <hi>Olle Brun,</hi>
where the King treated the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> at
Dinner: That Prince gave afterwards ſo many
Marks of his Conſideration and Eſteem for his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oliſh Majeſty, that the King thought he could
never ſufficiently teſtifie to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
the Eſteem, and, if I may venture to ſay it, the
Veneration which his Vertues and extraordinary
Merits inſpired him with. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
in his Converſation after this Interview, ſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes,
that the Republick of <hi>Poland</hi> had never
ſhown greater Proofs of Judgment than in the
Choice they had made of ſo great a King; and his
Miniſter, Count <hi>Taff,</hi> being then preſent, added,
That the King of <hi>Poland</hi> himſelf knew very well,
that in the time of his Negotiation at the General
Diet, he had aſſured him in the Name of the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> his Maſter, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
from his Pretenſions to the Royalty, if he, the
Grand Marſhal, made any to that Crown.</p>
               <p>The Army ſojourned two Days at <hi>Olle Brun,</hi> and
during this Interval 500 Dragoons and 1500 Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
were ſent to lay a Bridge over the <hi>Danube.</hi>
On the 3d of <hi>Sept.</hi> they incamped near <hi>Stadeldorf,</hi>
a Pleaſure-Houſe ſcituated on a riſing Ground,
wherein the King lodged, and in which the Elector
of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who arrived the night before, came to
ſalute his Majeſty; as Prince <hi>VValdeck</hi> had done
the Day before. On the 4th they tarried there to
hold a general Council, at which aſſiſted (beſides
the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and
Prince <hi>VValdec,</hi> General of the Troops of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles)
General <hi>Caprara,</hi> and ſome others of that
Rank. On the 5th the Palatin of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> Grand
General of the Crown, arrived with the Poliſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which the King ſaw defile, and ordered
them at the ſame time, to march to the Bridge,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54820:52"/>
whither he followed in Perſon about 4 a Clock at
Night, and where the whole Army encamped upon
the Brink of the <hi>Danube.</hi> The Bridge was built
over-againſt the Town of <hi>Thoulon,</hi> ſix Leagues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<hi>Vienna,</hi> at a Place where the River forms
two Iſles, which required three Bridges, and made
the Paſſage the more ſecure by a plurality of eaſie
Retreats, defended by the Arms of the <hi>Danube.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 6th of <hi>September</hi> the Army began to
paſs the Bridges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the King, in the mean time,
dined in one of the Iſles: The Great General of
<hi>Poland</hi> marched on the Head of all, with his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Troops, as if it were to cover the reſt; and it
is certain that that Poſt was their due, the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
being ſo dejected with Fatigues, and Toils,
occaſioned by the bad ſtate of Affairs, that they
wanted to be incouraged and heartened. The
ſight of a Turban frightened them, an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Cry of <hi>Alla,</hi> which the Turks uſe in War, and
ſignifies God, allarmed the Camp, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
twice or thrice, the Night after they had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the <hi>Danube.</hi> This Diſpoſition was the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that the Poliſh Army had the right, and that
of the Emperor with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> at their
Head the Left: the Electors keeping in the
Center near the King's Perſon.</p>
               <p>That Night he incamped beyond the Bridges on
<hi>Thoulm</hi> ſide, where he tarryed the 7th and 8th, that
all the Army &amp; Bagage might paſs over. The Troops
of the El. of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which came that way out of
his Electorate, joined us the firſt Day, and next
Day that Prince arrived by Water in the Camp, a
little before the King left <hi>Thoulm.</hi> Here the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> appointed ſeveral of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
Huntſmen to conduct the Ranks through the
Defiles of the Mountains, which they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ranged as a Hunting, and knew very well;
theſe Guides led the Army through the leaſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54820:52"/>
ways, and over the eaſieſt Hills, though this
Mountainous Country is every where bad for a
March; inſomuch that they could carry but very
little of their Artillery with them, and that with
inconceivable Trouble, notwithſtanding they were
ſo ſmall, that they could mount them with the
help of an Irou Crow.</p>
               <p>He had ſo many Tartars and uſeleſs Horſe in
his Camp, as did nothing but ſtarve him, and
Forage began to be very ſcarce with him; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
our Troops met no Body in thoſe Defiles,
but ſome Servants of the Army, who were keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Cattle here and there, and fled upon firſt ſight
of us. But that which happened to a Colume of
Poliſh Foot will certainly appear to be very odd.
A Tartar Officer commanding a Party of about 30
Horſe, happened in his March to fall into a Cloſs-Valley,
and finding the ſaid Body of Poles there,
he came up to General <hi>de Henoff,</hi> who was at their
Head, not to fire upon him, but cooly to ask him
News, as if they had been Friends; and when he
was told, That they were Part of the Poliſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which was advancing under the command of
the King in Perſon, he anſwered jearingly, That
he knew very well that Prince <hi>Lubomirski</hi> had
brought ſome Poliſh Troops to the ſuccour of the
Germans: After which he rode off with his Troop
without General <hi>de Henoff</hi>'s, thinking fit to attack
him, or perhaps he could not do it in that hollow
Way, or that the Tartars kept himſelf at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from him.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having provided the Army
with good Guides, made the King take the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Way over the Mountains, and accompanied
him almoſt conſtantly; as did alſo the Emperor's
Chief Generals. They decamped from <hi>Thoulm</hi>
on the 9th of <hi>September</hi> 1683. in the Afternoon.
Next Day they paſſed half of the Defiles; and the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54820:53"/>
Court ſtop'd at Night on a great ſteep Hill, which
they had gained with much trouble: The King
had found it ſo troubleſom to get up that Hill,
that he wrote the ſame Night to the Queen, <hi>That
the Fatigue of the March, together with the want
of Proviſions, had made them loſe ſo much Fleſh,
that they were fit to run with a Hart upon the
Courſe.</hi> Thoſe who gave out, That that Prince
was brought ſo low, that he was not able to get
on Horſeback any more, did not expect ſuch a
plain Contradiction as this Affair gave them; for
they did not croſs the Mountains in Coaches; and
'tis certain, that upon the Day of Battle his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was almoſt 12 Hours on Horſeback; I don't
ſay, but that he had ſome trouble to mount his
Horſe, for he was forced to make uſe of a Stool or
ſome riſing Ground at his mounting; But when
he is on Horſeback, he finds himſelf very eaſie,
which ſtood him in good ſtead at the Defeat of
<hi>Barcan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 11th they continued their March, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeeing any Appearance of the Army, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had any News of it ſince they left <hi>Thoulm;</hi>
for which they began to be uneaſie: But on the
3d Day about Noon they diſcovered the Points of
the Huſſars Lances: And the German Cavalry had
reached a Valley at the bottom of the laſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
where the King ſtopt and dined before he
marched up the ſame. This March was very tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to the whole Army, for beſides the great heat
of the Seaſon, they wanted Water, Proviſions,
Tents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Equipages ſtaying behind in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom:
And the King as well as Generals had only
Muleteers to follow them; ſo that His Majeſty was
forced one Day to eat nothing but Bread, and
drink only Water that was in the Flagons of the
Bavarian Soldiery, which they carried at their
Sides.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:54820:53"/>
During this Halt, the Army made a ſhift to
gain the top of the Hill: The Germans on
the left made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Calemberg,</hi>
and there planted their Cannon; the <hi>Polanders</hi> on
the Right took poſſeſſion of the Wood, and the
Eminences parallel to that of the Caſtle. In this
Place they encamped the ſame Day, being <hi>Sept.</hi> 11.
to give their Troops a Breathing time, and to
agree on the Order of Battle, in a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
that Evening. The encampment was very
irregular, the Ground not allowing them to make
it better. They were canton'd as well as they
could in the Wood; the Infantry being entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a ſmall compaſs of the open Country, where
they covered themſelves with <hi>Chevaux de friſe,</hi>
and with what Artillery was arriv'd; whilſt the
Cavalry were Poſted very diſorderly and confus'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in other places.</p>
               <p>Nothing hitherto appear'd to diſpute their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
though the Grand Viſier had certain notice of
the Approach of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> by a Turk
and a Tartar, taken in the Mountains, and ſent
back on purpoſe (after they had been well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined)
to give Intelligence of it as Eye witneſſes
of the matter. But that preſumptuous General
never troubled his head about it, and continued
the Siege with the ſame application, as if he had
only the Entrenchments of <hi>Vienna</hi> to force. He
was lodged in two places upon the Attack'd Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when the Succour arrived; and thinking to
force the Place to Capitulate before he could be
brought to a Battle, he only ſent below <hi>Calemberg,</hi>
in the Bottoms and Hollows of the low Hills on
the ſide of his Camp, a Body of about Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men, Horſe or Dragoons; theſe laſt fighting
on foot, according to the Diſpoſition of the
Ground, as their Janizaries do. Beſides he Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonaded
the City as uſual; which was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who upon hearing this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54820:54"/>
noiſe, declared that he had a very great eſteem
for the Turks, ſince they were ſuch brave Fellows
as to wait for his coming. For in the way it was
ſometimes ſuſpected that they would not, but in my
mind without grounds; ſince the Grand Viſier could
be in fear of none but him who defeated him, I mean
God Almighty, to whom alone this ſucceſs was
owing. He had ſtill left above 140000 Men; and the
whole <hi>Quota</hi> of our Armies amounted to no more
than 70000. The Empire with all its Members
made about 45000, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> not above
20000; without reckoning the Volunteers, which
upon ſuch an extraordinary occaſion flocked
from all parts, and compos'd a conſiderable Body.
The Marquiſs of <hi>Parelle,</hi> a Savoyard, brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at his own charge fourſcore Gentlemen all
Horſe; But the Volunteers ſwelled the Armies
without reinforcing them; and were often a
greater incumbrance than a ſtrength to them.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> Night <hi>September</hi> 11. They made
great Fires on the Hill, as a ſignal to the City of
the Arrival of the Supplies. But they ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, no more than of the Fight next day,
by reaſon of the diſpoſition and unevenneſs of
the Ground where this great Action paſſed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Siege was raiſed, the Governour <hi>Starem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
told the King that they only diſcovered the
Lances of the <hi>Huſſars</hi> with Perſpective Glaſſes,
from the Top of the Steeple of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s
Church.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had caus'd
the Deſcent of the Hills to be deſcry'd by a <hi>French</hi>
Man that was near his Perſon; and whom he
look'd upon as an Engineer becauſe he knew
ſome Terms of that Art. This pretended En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer
had a great Opinion of his own Parts; and
to ſhew ſome proofs of it in this juncture, he was
very warm in giving a Deſcription of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54820:54"/>
through which they were to march to the
Turkiſh Camp; being willing to cry down thoſe,
who, he ſaid, had miſinform'd his Majeſty on
this Subject, in telling him of great Plains, fit
for his <hi>Gens-des-Armes;</hi> whereas there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Precipices, Hollow Ways, and Rocky
Deſcents. This Scene paſs'd in the preſence of
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and of other Generals of
the Emperor, who were offended at the diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful
manner, wherein a Man of this Character
dar'd to extol himſelf in ſuch an Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>It was therefore neceſſary to draw up a Line of
Battle according to the Diſpoſition of the Ground,
and to make uſe of the Cavalry as well as they
could; ſince this Affair could not be decided but
by beating the Enemy from their Poſts, and by
particular Skirmiſhes. Nor did the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
at that time think of being able to reach the
Turkiſh Camp from the Brow of the Hill, in leſs
than three Days; and marked out with his Eye
the places where they ſhould Encamp <hi>Septemb.</hi> 12.
and 13th, by driving the Enemy gradually out
of the Poſts and Defiles, which they held by great
Platoons of Cavalry, or Muſqueteers on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
whom I before called Dragoons, from their
manner of fighting.</p>
               <p>All thoſe matters were ſettled in the Council
of War held <hi>Septemb.</hi> 11. after Midnight. A
Scheme was drawn of the Maſhalling the Forces
wherein the Polanders were to be on the Right,
and their Generals to draw up in the form of a
Half Moon in the Wood and Hills, to prevent the
Tarters from falling upon the Army in the Flank
or the Rear, whilſt it was engaged with the
Turks poſted (as might reaſonably be fear'd) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Camp. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> took the
Left towards the Deſcent on the ſide of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,</hi>
by poſſeſſing himſelf of <hi>Calemberg</hi> and the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54820:55"/>
adjacent Eminences: By this means he had a leſs
compaſs to fetch, to march to the Turkiſh Camp
and the Attacks; ſo that it was he (properly
ſpeaking) that clear'd the Trenches, and Rais'd the
Siege. The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> drew up his Troops
on the Right of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the
Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> his on the Right of the Duke
of <hi>Saxony;</hi> each of theſe Princes keeping at the
Head of his own Body. The King of <hi>Poland</hi>
Poſted himſelf in the Centre of all, animating
this great Body with his Preſence and Voice;
acting in all places, and giving his Orders, which
according to the Emperor's Command were obeyed
with the utmoſt ſubmiſſion. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
ſent a great many Adjutants to be near his <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Majeſty, to receive his Orders and to convey
them to all parts of the Army. To the Infantry
were allowed <hi>Chevaux de friſe:</hi> On the Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Emeniences were planted what Cannon they
could get: But nothing could be expected from them
becauſe of their ſmalneſs, and the height of the
Place on which they were planted. This incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
was obſerved in the Battery that was
made at <hi>Calemberg,</hi> which began to fire <hi>Sunday
Septemb.</hi> 12. about Ten in the Morning on the
Main Body of the <hi>Turks</hi> Poſted below, without
reaching them. For, as we ſaid before, the
Grand Viſier, convinc'd at laſt of the Approach
of the Succours, took no other precautions to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Siege, than only to ſend on <hi>Saturday</hi> Night
a Body of 10 or 12000 Men (whoſe Standards we
could only ſee in the Covert or Hollow ways)
to take Poſſeſſion of the bottom below this Caſtle.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Sunday September</hi> 12. 1683. The <hi>German</hi>
Troops about break of Day began to Skirmiſh
with this Detachment of the Enemy; whom they
chaſed from Poſt to Poſt; and there were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Skirmiſhes carry'd on very warmly on both
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54820:55"/>
ſides. Among the Reſt, the Dragoons of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
thoſe of <hi>Crouy,</hi> a Regiment of the Army of
<hi>Saxony,</hi> and that of a ſmall Body of <hi>Polanders,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Chevalier <hi>Lubomirsky,</hi> ſignaliz'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
particularly. Theſe Troops were inſenſibly
drawn into fight, and began at laſt a regular
Battle, in the Villages and Defiles, where the
<hi>Turks</hi> defended themſelves vigorouſly, diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Foot, and afterwards mounting on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
which deceived one of theſe Bodies of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
who ſuppoſing that the Enemy fled, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
too forward, and were cut in pieces.
In this Action the Lieutenant Colonel of <hi>Lubo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirsky</hi>'s
Dragoons, nam'd <hi>Kinſik,</hi> was wounded
in the Head with a Sabre, who died within three
days after; notwithſtanding the Horſeſhoe
that he had in his Hat to defend him from the
Blow.</p>
               <p>The Marquiſs of <hi>Parelle</hi> deſired leave to go with
his Volunteers to drive the <hi>Turks</hi> out of that
Poſt; but the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> every time he made
the Propoſal, ſeemed as if he heard him not,
and order'd Colonel <hi>Mercy</hi> to do it, charging
him thrice together not to go without his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.
This was a very brave Officer, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Partyman: He executed the Order with
as much Addreſs as Valour. The <hi>Turks</hi> were
driven out of that Poſt, and all of a ſudden ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
over the whole face of the Mountainous
Country. The Grand Viſier himſelf came at laſt
out of his Camp, and poſted himſelf not far from
the Lines of it with a Body of Cavalry, which
according to the Accounts that have been given,
and the Relations of thoſe who were in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were upwards of 30000 Men: But the number
did not appear ſo great to thoſe who ſaw that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Grand Viſier broken by two Companies
of <hi>Huſſars;</hi> one of which, and the firſt that made
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54820:56"/>
the Onſet was commanded by <hi>Alexander</hi> the King
of <hi>Poland</hi>'s ſecond Son.</p>
               <p>Before I deſcend any further to particulars,
I muſt take notice, that the Janizaries did not
appear upon this occaſion, none but the Cavalry
and Dragoons, which laſt fought ſometimes on
Foot. The Infantry ſtill carried on the Aſſault,
and maintained the Trenches: For the Beſieged
have ſaid ſince, that they made three Sallies that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, and took or Nail'd up thirty Pieces of
Cannon. The Camp therefore remained ſtill in
the ſame Poſture, and the Conqueror found their
Tents ſpread, as if the Grand Viſier had deſign'd
his March before the Chriſtians for no more
than a Walk. But the wiſer among the <hi>Turks</hi>
had other thoughts of the matter. The Cham of
<hi>Tartary</hi> was the firſt that took care of his Retreat,
The Principal <hi>Baſſas</hi> ſent their Equipage away
before hand, with the Camels and Led-Horſes;
of which there were but a few left, and ſcarce
anything elſe conſiderable, ſo that the Soldiery
had but indifferent Plunder. This very Day in
the Morning we had deſcry'd from the top of the
Mountains the retreat of all theſe Equipages,
And whereas they raiſed a great Duſt in <hi>Raab</hi>
Road, it was thought at firſt that it was rais'd by
the Reinforcement of the 20000 Men, which
as it was reported in our Army, were to
to be ſent to the Camp before <hi>Vienna,</hi> by the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
who was advanced as far as <hi>Belgrade.</hi> But of
this Reinforcement we could never get any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
intelligence.</p>
               <p>The Precaution of theſe <hi>Baſſas,</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated
retreat of the Cham of <hi>Tartary,</hi> were
look'd upon among the <hi>Turks</hi> as ariſing from a
correſpondence they held with the King of <hi>Poland</hi>
The Viſier of <hi>Buda</hi> loſt his Head for it. The
Cham of <hi>Tartary</hi> was depoſed by the Sultan's
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54820:56"/>
Authority, who gave the Grand Viſier Orders to
do it, upon the complaints that he had preferr'd
to his Highneſs about it, after the raiſing of the
Siege. It was likewiſe reported among us, that the
King of <hi>Poland</hi> made way for this happy ſucceſs by
a ſecret negotiation; as he had done at <hi>Kotchim,</hi> the
evening before the Battle by the deſertion of the
<hi>Hoſpodars, Valachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia,</hi> which he dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly
brought about by the prevalence of his
Promiſes. But theſe are conjectures too refin'd
with reſpect to the Affair of <hi>Vienna;</hi> and beſides
the remainder of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army was enough to
have prevented the King of <hi>Poland</hi> from being Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
if they had but done their duty. Apannick
fear infus'd from on high into all their hearts, by
one of thoſe ſudden Motions of which no account
can be given, was that alone which routed this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Army, as had been promis'd in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by Father <hi>Mark de Aviano</hi> a Capuchin Friar,
famous for contemplation; and of ſo great an
eſteem for his Goodneſs, as to be ſaid to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
This Holy Man we met with at <hi>Calem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi>
who always attended the Army during the
Fight. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> heard him ſay Maſs
and received the Communion at his hands in the
Chappel of St. <hi>Leopold,</hi> which is not far from the
other Fabrick. This Capuchin afterwards gave
the Benediction in the name of the Pope to all the
Generals, and aſſured them in the name of God of
a compleat Victory, if they had but the Faith to
Truſt in him. <hi>Si habebitis,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Confidentiam
in Deo, obtinebitis Victoriam. Theſe are the Fryar's
own words.</hi> But to return to the Fight.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the <hi>German</hi> Troops were engaged the
Cannon of <hi>Calemberg</hi> plaid upon the <hi>Turk,</hi> and
the reſt of the Army began to draw out of the
Wood forming themſelves into a Line of Battle.
The King of <hi>Poland</hi> returning from the Chappel
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54820:57"/>
of St. <hi>Leopold</hi> made an halt in the bottom below
that Fortreſs, where he din'd under a Tent pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that place on purpoſe, and afterwards
mounted his Horſe to march towards the Enemy,
with a deſign (as I ſaid before) only of beating
them to ſuch an Eminence, where he intended to
have incamped on this Day, being <hi>Sept.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>The Fight therefore began then on all ſides,
and it was juſt paſt Eleven a Clock. The <hi>Turks</hi>
being Poſted in the Rocky Bottoms fenced with
Walls in ſeveral places; and in the high and
thick Vineyards, vigorouſly received the charge
at firſt, and killed a great many Men. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the <hi>Huſſars</hi> of the Caſtellan of <hi>Cracow,</hi>
headed by his Son the Staroſt of <hi>Halich</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
ſeveral diſcharges, in one of which that
young Lord, notwithſtanding his coat of Mail,
was ſhot through the Body with a Musket ſhot;
as was <hi>Mondreowsky</hi> Treaſurer of the Court, in
another Poſt; or as ſome ſay, in paſſing at the
head of the Line to carry out the King's Orders.
It was in theſe firſt Motions they began to deſcry
the main Body of the Grand Viſier, poſted in the
Lines of the Camp; and ſometime after a ſmall
Red Tent which was raiſed on purpoſe to take a
view of the Fight in the ſhade out of the Sun,
(for never was there ahotter day known than this)
The Grand Viſier's Men have ſince inform'd us that
he there apprehended the <hi>Caffa</hi> with his two Sons,
and the Cham of <hi>Tartary.</hi> No ſooner had the
King a ſight of this Tent, but knowing it by its
Colour, he found himſelf animated afreſh; and being
engaged, that he could not ſet his Eyes on his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who were not come up, and to whom he had
ſent time after time; he marched at the head of the
firſt Batallions which he met with, cauſing his
Cannon to play continually on that Tent. But he
had no more than two or three Pieces, which were
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54820:57"/>
rolled along on Levers according as they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Enemy; and the King promiſed fifty
Crowns for each Diſcharge. The miſchief of it
was they had but few Bullets at hand, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ram down upon them. I have heard a
<hi>French</hi> Engineer ſay, that for want of ſome other
thing to ram down, he made uſe at laſt of his
Gloves, his Perriwig, his Cravet, and a great
Pacquet of Gazets, that were in his Pocket.</p>
               <p>At laſt the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Infantry came up. The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
grew warm on all ſides: The <hi>Turks</hi> were beat
from Eminence to Eminence; and at laſt the
Count of <hi>Maligny</hi> the Queen's Brother, with the
Grand Squire of the Crown, was the firſt who
gain'd that Eminence, where the King had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to have Encamp'd this day. But immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty perceived the <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Squadrons to give ground, which denoted them
to be leſs reſolute than before. In effect our Troops
broke them, upon which this Monarch cry'd out
<hi>That they were defeated,</hi> by a certain Warlike
penetration of thought habitual to him ever ſince
he fought againſt thoſe Infidels. He ordered the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> by the Adjutants near his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to ſend him forthwith ſome Troops. He
cauſed his <hi>Huſſars</hi> to advance, whom we ſaw to
deſcend down a hollow Way on foot, among
the Walls and Steep Places, where a Footman
could ſcarce ſtand upright; and at the ſame time
the King himſelf fell upon the Viſier's main Body
recommending the Prince his Son to the Count
of <hi>Maligny</hi> his Brother-in-Law, whoſe Valour
and good Conduct, had been experienced in this
and ſeveral other Rencounters.</p>
               <p>Every thing happened according as he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
The <hi>Huſſars</hi> of Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> fell upon
the main Body of the Grand Viſier, routed
them, and in that inſtant the whole Army of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54820:58"/>
Enemy retreated without making any reſiſtance:
The Grand Viſier endeavoured in Vain to make
them ſtand their ground: He addreſſed himſelf
to the Cham of <hi>Tartary, What,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>will you
not ſtand by me?</hi> But that Man already diſheartned
as well as the reſt reply'd, <hi>That he knew the King
of</hi> Poland, <hi>and that he could not be ſafe with him any
otherwiſe than by flying from him;</hi> of which he gave
him an Example immediately. The Viſier endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
ſtill to rally ſome part of his Cavalry;
and ſeeing they all fled before the <hi>Huſſars,</hi> he, with
Tears in his Eyes embrac'd his two Sons, and was
carried off by the Croud; and quitting his War-Horſe
which was barded with Steel-Armour, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd
with Gold, and quilted with Crimſon Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet;
and making his eſcape with only one Veſt:
an inſtance which I obſerve to let you know that
I was well informed as to this particular, the
which I ſaw in the Letter of the Prince of <hi>Tranſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania;</hi>
who ſent word to the King, that he had
lent him one from that very night.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> march'd
on the left, where he met with no manner of
Oppoſition; and having a leſs compaſs to fetch
in order to arrive at the Camp on that ſide of it,
which lay next to the City and the Trenches,
the <hi>German</hi> Forces entred it betimes. It was a
little paſt half an hour after Six when the King
of <hi>Poland</hi> paſs'd through the midſt of it, where a
young Turk of a comely aſpect preſented him
with the Grand Viſiers Horſe, very fit indeed for
the Parade of a Publick Entry; but for no other
uſe by reaſon of the weight of its Armour.
Another Turk came with great haſt, and one
of the Grand Viſiers ſtirrups in his hand to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty, which he ſent to the
Queen to be laid at the feet of the Miraculous Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix
of the Cathedral of <hi>Cracow.</hi> A third
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54820:58"/>
waited upon him, to inform him of the Place
where that <hi>Ottoman</hi> General's Tents were pitch'd;
whither the King ſend his Dragoons, as a Guard,
charging them to forbear pillaging. He likewiſe
order'd all the Army to ſtand ſtill in Battalia, for
fear the Enemy rallying behind the Camp, ſhould
renew the Fight, and ſo rob them of ſuch a cheap
Victory. This they might have done, had not a
Terror ſtill poſſeſs'd them, and carry'd them with
the ſame impetuoſity to the Bridges of the River
of <hi>Raab.</hi> For, ſpight of the King's Orders, the
Souldiers began to plunder that very Night. The
General <hi>Dunneval,</hi> who they ſay was a greedy
Lover of Rich Booties, in his Rounds, met with
the Tent of the Baſſa of <hi>Egypt,</hi> very ſuitable to his
Purpoſe, and <hi>a-propos</hi> to his deſires. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
Envoy was hard-by, ſtill in Chains, which
he had worn ever ſince he had been at <hi>Adrianople.</hi>
In ſeveral places of the Camp, they met with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Children, maſſacred or wounded by thoſe
Barbarians, who could not carry them off in ſuch
a precipitate Retreat. One of thoſe Children, of
a very Beautiful Aſpect, and wounded in the Head,
was brought before the King.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſeeing the Army abſolute
Maſters of the Camp, ſent to the King, to give
Orders for the clearing the Trenches, where they
ſtill fir'd, and kept playing upon the Town, 'till
Ten at Night: But the King, who was unwilling
that the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould have the Honour of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Siege, at the firſt reply'd, That it was
needleſs, and that it was better to make ſure of the
Camp, againſt an unexpected Return: And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
gave out, that he had already detach'd ſome
Forces for that purpoſe. However, either the
<hi>Germans</hi> went thither of their own Heads, or the
<hi>Janizaries</hi> retreated of themſelves; for not a
Man ſtirr'd out of the Camp, where the King
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54820:59"/>
ſpent the Night at the foot of a Tree, lying upon
his Horſe-Saddle, in ſtead of a Pillow. About Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
the Governor of <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſent out ſome of
his Men, who brought his Majeſty ſome Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Sweet-Meats, Wine, and other things.
'Tis an inconceivable thing, the Truth of which
we could never learn, How all that Infantry made
their Retreat, in a Night the darkeſt that ever
was ſeen. For we diſcovered neither Stragler, nor
Company, except 23 <hi>Janizaries,</hi> ſhut up in that
Houſe of the Emperor, where the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi>
kept his Head-Quarters, and laid up his Stores.
Theſe <hi>Janizaries</hi> did not fly with the reſt, but
were in that place <hi>Sept.</hi> 14. Attempts were made
to force them; they kill'd ſeveral Dragoons, and
would not ſubmit to any but the King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
when he came before that Caſtle, out of which
they were allow'd to march with Bag and Baggage.</p>
               <p>This great Victory, ſo-compleat, ſo happy, and
ſo ſhining, coſt but a very few Men: the <hi>Germans</hi>
loſt a Prince of <hi>Crouy;</hi> the <hi>Poles,</hi> the two Lords
above-mention'd; and the whole Army about 600
Men. A great part never ſaw the Enemy: The
Palatine of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> with his Right Wing, march'd
all along without a Rencounter: The Emperour's
<hi>Cuiriaſſiers</hi> never ſtruck a ſtroke; the Second Lines
were no more than Spectators, becauſe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
fled before they were come up: ſo that, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſpeaking, none but the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry,
and the <hi>Huſſars,</hi> bore the Fire, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
the Enemy. We cannot tell what happen'd
particularly on the Left: Each Prince kept at the
Head of his own Troops, and none but Count
<hi>Waldeck</hi> was ſeen next the King's Perſon; and that
but once, when the heat of the Battle was near
over; upon which he paſs'd this Compliment to
his Majeſty, <hi>That it was a good Days-work for his
Glory, and for the Hiſtory of his Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:54820:59"/>
From this true Recital, we may Diſcover the
Falſity of that Report, which was ſpread abroad,
and publiſh'd even in <hi>Poland</hi> it ſelf; namely, That
the <hi>Turks</hi> had forty thouſand kill'd upon the ſpot.
<hi>Talenty,</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Secretary, whom the King
diſpatch'd to the Pope the next Day after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
with the great Standard of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> found
at the Portal of the Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> told ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Story in his Journey; and had the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to tell his Holineſs himſelf, That in leaving
<hi>Vienna,</hi> he travell'd four Leagues together on dead
Bodies. Now in the firſt place, his Way to <hi>Rome</hi>
did not lie through the Field of Battle, nor through
any part of the Road, by which the <hi>Turks</hi> made
their Retreat, ſome of whom were cut off; both
this Night and on the Morrow: And beſides, it is
certain, that in the whole compaſs of the Ground,
there were not above 800 dead Corps to be ſeen.
I do not ſpeak this to leſſen the Glory of his <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Majeſty, which ſhines bright enough of it ſelf; the
Greatneſs of the Undertaking, the wonderful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
that attended it, and above all, that Heroical
Reſolution, which made him leave his Dominions
to come to the Relief of his Allie, are enough to
ſet it off, without the help of any falſe Luſtre.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Senators and Generals, were
likewiſe for his immediate Return home, after the
Relieving <hi>Vienna,</hi> that he might preſerve an Army,
of which <hi>Poland</hi> might in the ſequel of the War,
ſtand in need. But the King hearkened neither
to theſe Advices, nor to the repeated Inſtances of
the Queen: He was for compleating the Buſineſs,
and thereby to lay the Empire under ſtronger
Obligations to him. 'Tis upon thoſe Accounts that
his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty merits Praiſe, without the killing
of 40000 Men. 'Tis reported of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
<hi>Great,</hi> That he was highly offended with one of
his Generals, who, in the Hiſtory of his Wars,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54820:60"/>
aſcribed falſe Matters of Fact to him, thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to enhance his Glory: He threw the
Tablets into the River <hi>Hydaſpes,</hi> (upon which he
was, when the Recital was made to him) and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
the Author, for having foiſted his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
into ſuch a large Field of Praiſe, which
Truth alone was ſufficient to repreſent.</p>
               <p>On Munday <hi>Sept.</hi> 13. the King detach'd <hi>Miogensky</hi>
with a thouſand Horſe, to purſue the Enemy, and
cut off their Retreat. This Officer, when he was
come over againſt <hi>Presburgh,</hi> detach'd fifty Horſe,
who advanced as far as <hi>Raab,</hi> where they ſaw the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, which began to paſs the Bridges
very quietly. It had marched twelve <hi>Hungarian</hi>
Leagues the firſt Night, and began to defile on
the Morrow, without any oppoſition. The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of <hi>Yavarin,</hi> durſt not, or could not undertake
the burning of the Bridges; the Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
very cautiouſly, left a conſiderable Body of
Men to guard them. They were three Days and
three Nights, in paſſing over the River, and met
with no diſturbance. Some blame the King of
<hi>Poland</hi> for this, who ſhould (they ſay) have puſh'd
on his Victory: But this Charge is groundleſs,
ſince his Troops could not have left the Camp
that Night, without great danger. They had been
without their Equipages for three Days, and could
not expect that they could paſs the Mountains in
leſs than three Days more. Beſides, the greateſt
Generals, having finiſh'd what they deſign'd, are
well enough ſatisfied with that, and never care for
running after the Conquered, to whom <hi>Martial
Policy</hi> often thinks it adviſeable, to allow Bridges
for their Retreat.</p>
               <p>After the Departure of <hi>Miogensky,</hi> the King
viſited the Camp, and the Tents of the Grand <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier;</hi>
from whence, in a few words, he wrote the
News of his Victory to the Pope, and other Princes.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54820:60"/>
He ſent a Gentleman, Expreſs to the Queen, as an
Eye-witneſs of all that had paſs'd, with ſeveral
Pieces of that great Spoil: And for the ſake of
this Good News, the Imperial Miniſters order'd
the Poſt-Maſters to demand nothing of that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
for his Journey. Afterwards the King over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran
all the Enemies Works, even to their laſt Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the Baſtions. But in the <hi>Interim,</hi> ſome
Souldier or other, having accidentally ſet fire to
ſome looſe corns of Powder that lay about the
Magazine, where there were ſtill nigh 300 thouſand
pound weight, it caus'd one of the moſt dreadful
Fires that could be imagin'd: The Air ſeem'd to
be all in a blaze, the Earth ſhook, and nothing
could give us a more lively reſemblance of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Conflagration at the Laſt Day. However,
there was ſome thing ſurprizing, even in this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Proſpect; and his Majeſty ſaid, That he had
long wiſh'd to ſee ſuch a Sight.</p>
               <p>At laſt he made his Entry into <hi>Vienna,</hi> through
the Breaches, on the ſame ſide that the Aſſault had
been carry'd on. There he reap'd the full Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his Victory amidſt the Acclamations of
a City, deſtin'd before to a miſerable Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the Chains whereof this Hero broke. The
People Huzza'd him; the Croud did, as it were,
carry his Horſe along; and their Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
roſe ſo high, as to wiſh that they had a
Maſter and Emperor, like to this Glorious Monarch.
This they cry'd out loudly in every Street, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with ſuch an exceſs of Joy and Affection,
as cannot admit of Moderation, upon ſuch moving
Occaſions as this.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing he did was to return God Thanks
for his Victory, in the Church of the Reform'd <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
Fryars, before a Miraculous Image of the
Virgin; where he himſelf proſtrate on the ground
ſang the <hi>Te Deum.</hi> However, we could even then
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54820:61"/>
obſerve the beginning of Ingratitude among the
Perſons of Quality, and the Magiſtrates of that
City, offended perhaps that the Obligation was
ſuch, that it was impoſſible for them to make any
ſuitable Return. Neither in this Place, nor in any
elſe did we ſee any one of the Magiſtrates; and
with much ado, a Prieſt of this Church was got
to aſſiſt at the Ceremony. The ſame Coldneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
after Dinner at the Cathedral of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
for they tarry'd a great while before they could
get the Keys of the Veſtry, or any Tapers lighted.
Upon the Steeple of this Church, was ſet up that
<hi>Creſcent,</hi> which <hi>Solyman</hi> the Great oblig'd the City
to erect, when he drew his Forces from the Place,
at the ſecond Siege which he laid before it, in the
Reign of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> The King of <hi>Poland</hi> told the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> That it was requiſite to pluck it
down, ſince <hi>Vienna</hi> was at preſent freed for ever
from the Yoke, which the <hi>Sultan</hi> had threatned it
with. Yet this was not done till three Years after
the Siege was rais'd, as if they thought it neceſſary
to compliment an Enemy, which dreaded the Fate
of its own Dominions. But there was doubtleſs
a nicer Reaſon in the Caſe, grounded upon a ſort
of Jealouſy they had of his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty's Glory,
to whom they would not be beholden for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the <hi>Creſcent.</hi> This appears in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
which they made after the raiſing of the Siege,
wherein the Honour of the Succeſs was attributed
not only to this Great Monarch, but together
with him to all the Princes, who were at the Action,
to <hi>Staremberg, Caplier,</hi> the Commiſſary of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualling-Office,
with the Magiſtrates and Burgers
of the City; as was ſet down in the Reverſe.
Nay, the King was not ſo much taken notice of as
the Emperor, who kept up cloſe in the Mountains
of <hi>Paſſau;</hi> ſince the former was only commended
for his Preſence, whilſt the latter was extoll'd for
his Counſel and Forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:54820:61"/>
This very Day the King dined with Count <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg,</hi>
the Governor of the City, and returned
at Night to the Camp, pitch'd by his Orders, where
the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi>'s was before. From this place
he wrote to the Queen that ingenious Letter,
which was afterwards tranſlated into <hi>French,</hi> and
communicated to foreign Courts; and has been
printed in Fragments. It contain'd an Hiſtorical
Relation of the Matter of Fact, writ in a pleaſant
Style, rallying very handſomely on the Grand
<hi>Viſier,</hi> who had left him (ſays he) his ſole Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and Legatée. Then he gives the Particulars
of the Eſtate he had left him, and concludes in a
Vein of Rallery on the Cuſtom of the <hi>Tartarian</hi>
Women, who are offended with their Husbands,
when they return Home without a Booty. <hi>You
ſhall not object to me as thoſe</hi> Tartarian <hi>Dames, you
are no Man, for you come to me empty-handed: But
you will find me return at this time loaded with the Spoils
of the Enemy. God be prais'd</hi> (continues he) <hi>that he
has not permitted thoſe Infidels to inſult over the</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
<hi>but has made them ſenſible of the Power of their
God, whoſe Blows they have ſo lately felt.</hi> After this,
he added ſome <hi>Latin</hi> words of a Pſalm, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Cuſtom, who even when they
write to Women, have a ſprinkling of Phraſes and
Sentences of <hi>Latin</hi> in all their Letters.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> had, that Day he paſs'd the
Mountains, ſent the Abbot <hi>d'Oliva Hatsky,</hi> one of
his Chief Secretaries of State, to the Emperor;
who being encourag'd at the New of the approach
of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, return'd to <hi>Lints.</hi> From
<hi>Lints</hi> he came to <hi>Vienna,</hi> as ſoon as he heard of its
Relief, and made his Entry on Tueſday <hi>Sept.</hi> 14.
under the diſcharge of Cannon, at the ſame inſtant
that the Army decamp'd, in order to remove from
the noiſom Smells occaſioned by the dead Bodies,
and the filthineſs of the Camp, which one may
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54820:62"/>
imagine to be infected, by a two Months Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of nigh 700000 Men. The Stench was ſo
great, that this Morning the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
dining with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> was forc'd almoſt
all the while, to ſtop his Noſe with his Napkin.
His <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty preſented that Prince with three
very fine <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſes, two Standards, and ſome
Jewels fit for a Lady's wear; with a deſign that the
Elector ſhould ſend them into <hi>France,</hi> to his Siſter
the <hi>Dauphineſs.</hi> He likewiſe gave him alſo a <hi>Bont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chouk</hi>
of the Baſſa of <hi>Egypt,</hi> adorn'd at the Top with
an Hair Lace of diverſe Colours, with a Tuft of
Horſe-Tail round the gilded Creſt, which was the
Summit of this <hi>Bountchouk;</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> call
<hi>Touk.</hi> They are not ſo high as thoſe of the <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Generals, but a great deal more embeliſh'd in their
Warlike Furniture. Upon this Occaſion, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but obſerve, That among the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> the
Quality of Baſſas, and General Officers is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
by the number of thoſe Horſe-Tails dy'd
in red, which in the Army are faſtened to a Poſt
before their Tent-doors; and in their Chambers
are hung up with the <hi>Sabre,</hi> juſt by the place where
they lay. For 'tis to be obſerv'd, That the <hi>Turks,</hi>
even the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf, never wear their <hi>Sabres</hi> in
the Street, much leſs in their Houſes, where they
lay aſide all their Armour upon returning from
the Camp; except the Poignard or <hi>Anchard.</hi> The
very <hi>Baſſas</hi> in their Government, walking in the
Streets, with long Gowns, with a Chaplet in their
Hands, and no Arms; and when they ride, their
<hi>Sabre</hi> and <hi>Mace,</hi> or Truncheon, are clapp'd under
the Saddle on each ſide, with a large Strap to faſten
them. So that, excepting the Poignard (which
every one without diſtinction always wears by his
Side) the <hi>Turks</hi> may paſs for good Burgomaſters,
or Gentlemen of the Long Gown.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:54820:62"/>
To put an end to this Digreſſion, I ſhall here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
That the Prime <hi>Viſier,</hi> and the ſix Inferior
<hi>Viſiers,</hi> have three Horſe-Tails apiece: The <hi>Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glierbeys</hi>
as many: The <hi>Baſſas</hi> by right have only
one; but for a Perſonal Diſtinction, when they
have done ſome Signal Service, the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſends
another, and ſometimes a third, for each of which
they give twenty thouſand <hi>Piaſters,</hi> or Crowns, in
forty Bags. I muſt likewiſe here inform the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
That beſides the <hi>Prime Viſier,</hi> call'd by way
of Eminence <hi>The Grand Viſier,</hi> there are ſix others,
who with him make up the <hi>Divan,</hi> or Council of
State of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Viſier</hi> of
<hi>Buda,</hi> the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Boſnia,</hi> the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Bagdet</hi> or
<hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Baſſora</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> the <hi>Viſier</hi> of
<hi>Siliſtria,</hi> and the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Meſſir,</hi> which is <hi>Grand
Cairo:</hi> This laſt <hi>Viſier</hi> is call'd in General from
the Name of the Province, the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi>
whom the <hi>Turks</hi> eſteem as a <hi>Sultan,</hi> and as their
Emperor, by a particular Diſtinction of his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
As for the <hi>Becglierbeys,</hi> they are the Supreme
Governors of the Province, among whom there
are ſome ſtil'd <hi>Viſiers.</hi> The ſimple <hi>Beys</hi> are only
either Governors of Caſtles, or Colonels of the
Cavalry. But to return to the Relation.</p>
               <p>After the Emperor was come to <hi>Vienna,</hi> he ſent
the King of <hi>Poland</hi> Word, that he paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
to ſee him, and to thank him in Perſon, for
the Signal Service he had done him; which one
might eaſily have believ'd he would have done.
However, one would not have thought, That the
Emperor, after ſuch a piece of Service, would have
ſtood ſo much upon the Punctilio's and Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it. In ſhort, 'tis moſt certain, that after
ſeveral Debates upon that Subject, it was agreed
between the Miniſters of the Imperial Court, and
<hi>Guinsky,</hi> Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Poland,</hi> that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
of the two Princes, ſhould be in the open
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54820:63"/>
Field, and on Horſe-back, to avoid thoſe Niceties,
upon which his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty was once a-minded
to go away without ſeeing the Emperor. It was
on the Fifteenth of <hi>September,</hi> when they came to
an Interview, about a League and an half off of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> or a little more. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> had
decamped in the Morning, and tho' the Emperor
to ſtop his March, had ſent him word, that he was
coming to wait upon him, yet he ſtill continued
it, that he might oblige the Emperor to follow
him; and remov'd his Camp a quarter of a League
farther. The Troops were ſtill a filing off, when
they perceiv'd a Body of Cavalry, which was
compos'd of the Lords of the Imperial Court,
who had quitted their Coaches, and mounted on
Horſe-back, when they were about two hundred
Paces from the Army. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> at the
ſame time, order'd his Troops to draw up into a
Line of Battle; and afterwards advanc'd towards the
Emperor, who was making to him with full ſpeed.
After theſe two Princes were met, the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
unvailing his Bonnet, at the ſame time that
the Emperor clap'd his Hand to his Hat, told him
in <hi>Latin, That he was very glad that he had been able
in ſuch a Critical Juncture, to give him any ſolid marks
of his Friendſhip.</hi> After this ſhort Compliment, he
preſented the Young Prince his Son to him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
That he had brought him along with him
to teach him how he ought to ſuccour his Allies:
He likewiſe preſented to him the two Generals of
the Crown, who ſaluted the Emperor without
alighting. Laſtly, ſeeing that this Prince was
ſtiff and mute, without returning a word of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
or ſhewing any token of Honour, not ſo
much as ſaluting the Young Prince, the King left
him very bluntly, and ſaid, <hi>Without doubt, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you have a mind to take a view of my Army;
there are my Generals, whom I have order'd to ſhew it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54820:63"/>
your Majeſty.</hi> With that he turn'd his Head from
him, and march'd away; and the Emperor with
the ſame Indifference that he had heard this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
ſuffer'd him to depart; whilſt he for his
part went to viſit the Lines. Two Days after, he
ſent 3000 Ducats of Gold, to each of the two <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Generals, and a Sword ſet with Diamonds, of
about a thouſand Piſtols value, to Prince <hi>James.</hi>
As to him, the Emperor willing to make amends
for the Fault he had committed, in not ſaluting
him, of which there were loud and ſevere Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
made, he in my mind committed a freſh
one by writing to the Prince of <hi>Poland,</hi> a very
ſubmiſſive Letter, wherein he caſt all the Blame
of that Diſreſpect, on the Surprize he was in, in
remembring the Danger, and ſeeing the Perſon
who had deliver'd him from it. 'Tis ſaid, that he
wrote as much to the Caſtellan of <hi>Livonia,</hi> Baron
of <hi>Felkerzen,</hi> Prince <hi>James</hi>'s Governour; but this
I am no farther aſſur'd of, than that it was the
common Diſcourſe of our Court: but the other
Letter, I ſaw with my own Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>September</hi> 16. the Army reſted; the Seventeenth
it broke up, and encamped at <hi>Fichau,</hi> four Leagues
off <hi>Vienna:</hi> and in the mean time, the Bridge of
<hi>Toulm</hi> was order'd to be brought down, and to be
put on the Right Branch of the <hi>Danube,</hi> below
<hi>Presburg,</hi> by which they enter'd the Iſle of <hi>Schut;</hi>
which they were to croſs, becauſe the Country
from thence to <hi>Raab,</hi> through which the <hi>Turks</hi> had
made their Retreat, was all laid waſte; and the
other ſide towards <hi>Presburgh,</hi> was not in a better
condition, by reaſon of the Encampments of that
Body of an Army, which Count <hi>Teckeley,</hi> had
brought thither in the beginning of the Campaign,
and likewiſe becauſe of the Neighbourhood of
<hi>Newhauſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:54820:64"/>
The Army was divided into four Parts, for the
better conveniency of Forraging. The King of
<hi>Poland</hi> led the Van-guard of the whole with his
Troops, poſted about two or three Leagues in the
Front, towards the Enemy. The Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
came next with the Emperor's Cavalry,
marching a little towards the Right. The Count
of <hi>Staremberg,</hi> being march'd out of <hi>Vienna,</hi> at
the Head of the Infantry, which he had thrown
into that Town, led them on the Left ſide of the
Iſle by <hi>Goutta,</hi> and other Towns that border'd on
the Plains of <hi>Newhauſel.</hi> The Regiments of <hi>Croa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
brought up the Rear, at 3 or 4 Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
The King, by the way, went to viſit <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
when the Army was encamp'd over againſt
it. He likewiſe viſited <hi>Raab</hi> or <hi>Yavarin,</hi> going out
of the Iſle, with a ſmall Attendance, over which
a great Party of Rebels (lodg'd in ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's
Houſes thereabouts) might have had the
Better, being near the place where the King din'd,
but they durſt not attempt any thing; and the
King repaſs'd the River the ſame Night, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
the Army in the Iſland. The Rejoycings
and Feaſts which his Preſence occaſion'd in theſe
two Places, had nothing in them extraordinary.
The Prince of <hi>Poland</hi> threw a great many Ducats
in <hi>Presburgh,</hi> among the People that were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
under the Windows: At <hi>Raab,</hi> a great deal
of Wine and Powder was ſpent. The Biſhop of the
Place harangued the King, whom he ſtil'd the
King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and their Deliverer. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
made him a very Noble Feaſt, under the
<hi>Salvo</hi> of an hundred Cannon.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the King of <hi>Poland</hi> was croſſing the
great Iſle of <hi>Schut,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with
his Troops, was poſted between <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh:</hi>
The Count <hi>Waldeck,</hi> likewiſe, made a Halt
with thoſe of the Circles; and the Elector of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xony</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:54820:64"/>
drew off all his Forces. But his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
not willing to leave any thing for the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
to do, after he had done ſo much in this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Juncture, continued his March always at the
Head of his Army, to put an end to the Campaign,
and to return to his Eſtates, by the way of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper
Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this, he receiv'd a Letter from <hi>Michael
Apaffy</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> full of Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
upon the Succeſs of his Arms. He ſent
him word of the Arrival of the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi> at
<hi>Buda,</hi> whom the <hi>Sultan</hi> had pardon'd for the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
before <hi>Vienna,</hi> having ſent him a Veſt
and a Sabre, a Standard, and other Trophies of
the Dignity of Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> as an Aſſurance of his
being ſtill in his Favour. The <hi>Sultan</hi> was likewiſe
for Comforting his Son-in-Law, by the Example
of <hi>Solyman the Great,</hi> who met with the ſame Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
before <hi>Vienna;</hi> where indeed he was not
defeated, but only miſs'd of his Aim in taking it.
However, with all theſe Teſtimonies of Favour,
the <hi>Sultan</hi> order'd him, to make amends for this
Misfortune, by covering the Frontier Places. He
conſented to the Depoſing of the Old <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
who was ſucceeded by one of the <hi>Viſier</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:
and at the Death of the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
that Poſt was fill'd by <hi>Kara Mehemet Pacha,</hi>
the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi>'s Intimate Friend. This Letter
from the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> contain'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſeveral other Particulars, and concluded
with this Compliment to the King: <hi>That his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
was ſo compleat, and his ſteddy Reſolution ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
in carrying on his Deſign to the utmost; that
all Chriſtendom must ſtill remember his Name, and have
it always in their Mouths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor for his part, rewarded the Good
Services of the Count of <hi>Staremberg,</hi> on whom he
beſtow'd the Title of <hi>Felt-Mareſhal,</hi> that is, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54820:65"/>
of his Army;</hi> but he ſlighted thoſe of the Duke
of <hi>Saxe-Laonburg,</hi> whoſe Deſerts were equal to
his Birth, and who hop'd to have had the Dignity
that was conferr'd on <hi>Staremberg.</hi> This made the
Prince of <hi>Saxony</hi> to withdraw in Diſcontent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Satisfaction only of ſeeing the King of
<hi>Poland</hi> approve of his Reſentment, and Retreat.
That King ſent him a very rich Sabre, as a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his Eſteem, by a Gentleman who waited
upon him at <hi>Presburgh,</hi> where he had left the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
<hi>Staremberg</hi> had likewiſe the <hi>Golden-Fleece</hi>
beſtow'd upon him, and 100000 Crowns, being
part of 400000 ſent by the Pope, as a ſupply to
the Army.</p>
               <p>Thus have we given you a Faithful and Exact
Account of this Great Action, which will be a
more Shining Ornament to the Hiſtory of our
Age, by the Extraordinarineſs of the Event, than
by the greatneſs of the Matters of Fact. For we
ſhall in the Sequel, meet with more Heroical and
Conſiderable Tranſactions on one ſide, as well as
the other. I ſhall now preſent you with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of the March, and Encampments of the
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> from <hi>Tarnowits</hi> to <hi>Vienna;</hi> and ſet
down, upon occaſion the ſeveral Stages thereof.</p>
               <p>The firſt Country the King of <hi>Poland</hi> entred,
after he had left his own Dominions, was the
Dutchy of <hi>Sileſia.</hi> This Province is one of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Countries of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and
begins on the ſide of <hi>Poland,</hi> at <hi>Bengin,</hi> nine Leagues
off <hi>Cracow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Bengin</hi> to <hi>Tarnowits,</hi> three Leagues. This is
the Place, which the <hi>Poles</hi> call <hi>Tarnosky Goury.</hi> Moſt
of thoſe Towns of Provinces, ſubject at preſent to
the Republick, going under two Names. As for
the Leagues from hence to <hi>Vienna,</hi> they are to be
reckon'd as <hi>German</hi> Leagues of the larger Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
the ſwifteſt Courrier not being able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54820:65"/>
a Stage in leſs than two Hours, and ſome will
take above three Hours Riding.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Tarnowits</hi> to <hi>Gleibwitz,</hi> three Leagues, a
Stage and an half. In this Road, you will meet
with great variety of Woods, open Plains, Sandy
Fields, and Fertile Grounds, with ſome Villages,
that look better than thoſe in <hi>Poland,</hi> tho' the
Houſes are made of Wood: The Towns are all
wall'd, even <hi>Gleibwitz</hi> it ſelf, which is the leaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Road; but yet this Town makes ſome ſhew,
has a great Clock in it, its Gates are guarded, and
the Burghers are of a Manly Aſpect. The King
encamp'd at this Place the firſt Day after he had
left <hi>Tarnowits,</hi> and din'd at <hi>Veſſolo,</hi> a Village be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Glebwitz</hi> to <hi>Routh,</hi> three Leagues, a Stage
and an half. You ſtill meet with the ſame plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Proſpect of a mixt Country, which hitherto
is pretty good Travelling, tho' Sandy. <hi>Routh</hi> is
only a ſmall Village, ſituated in the midſt of a
Wood; but it has a very fine Abbey of the <hi>Ciſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Order, and the Poſt-Office is within its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Yard. The King din'd at <hi>Pilikvitzé,</hi> and
lay in the Abbey.</p>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>Dutchy of RATIBOR.</head>
                  <p>From <hi>Routh</hi> to <hi>Ratibor,</hi> three Leagues, one Stage
and an half. They are very long Leagues, and the
Country very cloſe and ſandy; but in going down
the Hills that lie next to the Marſhy Plain, in
which <hi>Ratibor</hi> is ſituated, we diſcover'd a very
pleaſant Country. This Marſhy Plain makes the
Avenues to the Town very difficult, by reaſon of
the Length of the Cauſeys made of Faggots. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibor</hi>
has Suburbs quite round its Walls, and is
waſh'd with the River <hi>Odar,</hi> which we paſs'd
over a Wooden Bridge, into one part of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54820:66"/>
Suburbs. The Place is very large, and ſet off
with Stately Brick Houſes. It is the Capital
City of a fine Dutchy, which the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi>
often pawns. <hi>Caſimir</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
it a long time, under that Title; and the
Heirs of Queen <hi>Lewes</hi> his Wife, pretended to great
Reimburſements after her Death for that Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
to be made out of the Emperor's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes.</p>
                  <p>The King, who din'd the third Day at <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titzé</hi>
juſt ſtep'd to <hi>Ratibor,</hi> where he ſtaid a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
with the Lords of the Family of <hi>Henoff,</hi> who
had provided a Collation for him; and went to
lye at <hi>Pietrovitzé.</hi>
                  </p>

This is an Uneven Country, but Champian, and
well manur'd: and this City is one of the fineſt in
the Province, ſurrounded with good Walls, with
Turrets, and ſeveral pieces of Workmanſhip on
the Gates; the Churches are well built; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of a graceful Mein: It has a Governor,
and a well-diſciplin'd Garriſon. On that ſide of
it towards <hi>Ratibor,</hi> the Suburbs are but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
through which runs the River <hi>Oppava,</hi> which
gives the City a Second Name, being call'd by the

no more than a Street, with a Gate at each End;

                     <hi>Moravia,</hi> is doubtleſs the Beſt of the Hereditary
Provinces, and the Richeſt Country of <hi>Germany.</hi>
It is fat, fertil, plentiful, populous, ſet off with
Neat Cities, and adorn'd with all that Nature can
afford, to make it Beautiful; having variety of
Plains, Green Foreſts, Vales, and Meadows, which
repreſent very pleaſing Proſpects to the Eye. On
the one ſide it borders on the Kingdom of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary:</hi>
It is ſeparated from <hi>Sileſia</hi> by a Ridge of
Mountains: On the Front, it has the Plains of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi>
terminated by the <hi>Danube;</hi> and on the Right,
the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> whoſe Language is very
like to the <hi>Moravian,</hi> being both a Dialect deriv'd

                  </p>
                  <p>The Capital City of <hi>Moravia</hi> is <hi>Olmutz,</hi> call'd in
<hi>Latin, Olomucium.</hi> It is well built, and ſet off with
a large Square, a great many Churches, Stately
Houſes, wide and clear Streets, ſtrong Walls,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54820:67"/>
which laſt are flanked with Turrets, cover'd with
a Mote, and other Modern Works. It is adorn'd
without with Sumptuous Seats, fine ſhady Walks;
and very advantagious for its Scituation, being at
the end of a Plain two Leagues long, bounded on
the Left with a Ridge of Hills, of different Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
ſuch as Meadows, Ponds, Thickets, and
the like, of which the City is the Point of Sight.
It is ſeated on a ſmall Riſing, over-looking a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Meadow, which ſurrounds three Sides of it;
with a River, that runs in a winding Stream thro'
the midſt: <hi>Olmutz</hi> is a Biſhoprick, whoſe Biſhop
is a Prince of the Empire, and has a Right of
Coyning Money; and I have ſeen ſeveral fine Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats
of his Coyn. He has a new Palace ſuitable to
his Dignity; yet the Garriſon and the Governor,
are plac'd by the Emperor in the City, and their
Diſcipline is Exact and Great. The King leaving
<hi>Hauff,</hi> din'd at <hi>Sternberg,</hi> and took up his Quarters

one Stage. The Country between is very uneven,
wholy Champian, and of an extraordinary Soil.
<hi>Proſtnitz</hi> is ſcituated in a Plain, and is leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
than <hi>Olmutz;</hi> but yet neat enough, being
built with Brick, as are all the Towns of this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſate;
its Houſes are lofty, and its Streets large.

                  <p>From <hi>Proſtnitz</hi> to <hi>Bitchau,</hi> two Leagues, one
Stage. It takes up in good Weather near four
Hours Time to travel this Stage; and in Winter,
'tis near a Day's Journey, by reaſon of the fat
Mountains, and dirty Soil. The Fields are all
open, ſtretching out towards the Left, and plow'd
into large Furrows. As for <hi>Bitchau,</hi> it is one of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54820:67"/>
the Beſt Cities of the Country, and its Land is the
Granary of all thoſe Parts.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Bitchau</hi> to <hi>Brinn,</hi> four Leagues, two Stages.
This laſt City is more conſiderable than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
not only for its Grandeur, fine Houſes, and
the Nobility with which 'tis fill'd, but alſo for
its Citadel; one of the Beſt I ever ſaw in thoſe
Parts. It takes in the compaſs of the whole Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of an high and inacceſſible Mountain, whoſe
Extremity at the Top has a Mantling, or Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp,
much like that of <hi>Montmidy</hi> in <hi>Luxemburgh.</hi>
Beſides this, <hi>Brinn</hi> has its fortified Walls, tho' ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular,
all cover'd with a ſort of Baſtions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Outſide, or looſe Works. It is ſituated on
a ſmall Prominence, at the foot of which, round
about, it has ſome Houſes in the Nature of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs.
Its Governor is a Noble Lord, very highly
eſteem'd by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who came to
refreſh himſelf at his Houſe, after the Siege of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi>
was rais'd. The King came thither in three

This is a Village in a very fat Soil, and a Plain, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſify'd

three Hours Riding. <hi>Moravia</hi> terminates at the
end of one League, at a certain Lake, over which
we paſs'd on a ſorry Wooden Bridge. Beyond the
Lake, <hi>Auſtria</hi> begins, and preſents us a new kind
of Proſpect, no leſs pleaſant for its Variety, than
Rich and Plentiful in its vaſt Extent. On the

ever ſince Fourteen Emperors of the Houſe
of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> have reign'd ſucceſſively; the laſt of
which have Eſtabliſh'd their Court there, and have
made a Splendid City of it. Beſides, <hi>Auſtria</hi> is a
Country abounding with variety of Plains, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
Hills, and large Foreſts, which afford ample
Diverſions to the Emperors, by that prodigious
quantity of Stags, and other large Beaſts, with
which they are ſtock'd, 'Tis certain that no
Country abounds ſo much with the former, as this
Province does: You may ſee them in whole Herds,
like ſo many Beeves round about <hi>Vienna;</hi> and 'tis
to be wondred what a great number of them the
Emperor takes every Year, whereof with the

and has been lodg'd there time out of Mind.
Theſe Hunting-Matches are three Months in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54820:68"/>
Year: The Emperor miſſes not one of 'em, having
ſtated and fix'd days for this Exerciſe, as he has for
Audiences. His Courtiers make a Buſineſs of State
of it; and at the place of <hi>Rendez-vous,</hi> take each of
'em a Noſegay of Greens, provided by the Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who preſent the Emperor with a Crown, and
a kind of Sceptre made of the ſame. The Scales
are carry'd along with 'em, to weigh each Beaſt
they kill, and the Regiſter, to take an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thereof: and the Emperor himſelf opens the
Belly croſs-ways with a large Knife, before any
dare touch it. When the Hunting-Matches are
over, they caſt up the Number and the Weight,
as ſet down in the Regiſter, and by comparing
them to former Years, and to other Emperors, they

Succeſs of the Reigning Prince, who is either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd

made no Additions, and ſpeak of no more than I

                  <p>The City of <hi>Niklitsbourg</hi> therefore is the firſt
City of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> on that Side of it that lies towards
<hi>Moravia.</hi> It is ſituated on a Riſing, commanded
by a very high Prominence, where is ſeen a great
Pile of Buildings, very Magnificent, even in their
Irregularity. 'Tis the Caſtle belonging to the
Lords of the Place, which looks more like a Prince's
Palace. The City is but ſmall, but neat, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd
with Suburbs, in one of which the <hi>Jews</hi>
are permitted to ſettle (a rare thing in thoſe parts):
It is adorned with Fountains, ſet off with a chain
of little Hills, that do, as it were, embrace it; and
by a pleaſant Vale, which lies below it.</p>
                  <p>From this Place to <hi>Vienna,</hi> they reckon nine
Leagues, and by Stages ten, which are very large
ones. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> turn'd off to the Right,

the ſtrait Road, there are no Walled Towns from
<hi>Niklitsbourg</hi> to <hi>Vienna):</hi> The Country is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious
by its Eminences, and by the low
Bottoms, in the nature of Valleys: 'tis fat and
fertile, mix'd with Vineyards, with ſeveral covert
Places: There are a great many Villages along
thoſe Valleys, as well as in the Hilly Country:
and every where a variety of Proſpects. The
largeſt Town on this Road is <hi>

Stage, from whence they reckon two more to
<hi>Vienna;</hi> tho' 'tis only three Leagues, taking in the
Paſſage of the <hi>Danube,</hi> from the firſt great Bridge
acroſs the two Iſlands. The Road <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olkeſtorf</hi> to
<hi>Vienna</hi> is a vaſt Plain, without Hedge or Buſh, at
leaſt for two Leagues together: On the Right it
is bounded with ſmall Hills, where are Villages
in the midſt of the Vineyard; and on the Left,
one may ſee to the opening of the Mountains,
made on purpoſe (they ſay) for an Entrance into
the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and for the Paſſage of

'Tis likewiſe the direct Road from <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
which on the ſame Line, is no more than
ten Leagues from that Village, without any other
Defile than the River of <hi>Moravia,</hi> which is fordable
in Summer, and at all times ſupply'd with a Ferry-Boat.
Theſe Countries (as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd)
from that River to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olkeſtorf,</hi> were the Seat

and having render'd them Famous by the
Bloody Battles, that he fought with the <hi>Turks</hi> and
<hi>Hungarians.</hi> The Reader may be the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of the Importance of this, by peruſing this
laſt Deſcription of the Road, where he will meet
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54820:69"/>
with no Rivers, nor Fortified Places, nor Foreſts,
nor Defiles: for that Ridge of Mountains between
<hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Sileſia,</hi> is a Road good and eaſie
enough, ſince the Stage is perform'd in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot;
and the Ways are broad, commodious,
without any ſteep Rocks, or frightful Precipices.
Nor are the Cities I have mention'd, any Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by their Situation, ſince 'tis not neceſſary to
go through them; and Travellers leave them on
the Right or Left, when they have nothing to do
there. There are no Fortified Places, nor deep
Rivers to paſs over, nor any narrow Ways to march
through: So that all was open from the <hi>Danube</hi> to
<hi>Viſtula,</hi> or at leaſt to <hi>Oder,</hi> which is a large and
deep River; but ſuch as the <hi>Tartars</hi> might have
ſwam over, or paſs'd by the Bridge of <hi>Ratibor,</hi>
which was left unguarded.</p>
                  <p>Such an Incurſion would have been a fatal Blow
to the Emperor's Affairs, by ravaging three of his

be reckon'd ſuch, as well for the Richneſs of their
Soil, which ſurpaſſes <hi>Sileſia,</hi> by the large Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards
that are in both; as alſo for the number of
their Cities, more conſiderable, and better built
than thoſe of that Dutchy. The Wines of <hi>Auſtria</hi>
and <hi>Moravia,</hi> are not indeed very rich; they are
of an Orange colour, and have a Flavour neither
perceptible by the Eye, nor the Palate: yet they
are ſold very much in thoſe Provinces, and at <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
they drink none elſe.</p>

Theſe are all very large Villages, and built either
of Stone, or Mud, or Brick. The firſt Stage is
very long; the next, three Hours Riding at leaſt;
but the laſt are common ones.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a Stage ſet up from <hi>

through <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> but leaving it on the Left, you

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olkerſtorf</hi> acroſs
the Plains to the River of <hi>Moravia,</hi> and thence to
<hi>Presbourg,</hi> By this means one ſaves four Leagues

<hi>Danube,</hi> once over the Bridges of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> and
again in a Ferry-Boat, over againſt <hi>Presbourg.</hi> But
becauſe that Road was not ſafe during the firſt
Year of the War, by reaſon of the Inroads which
the <hi>Hungarians</hi> made into <hi>Moravia,</hi> I always went
by <hi>Vienna,</hi> in the two Journeys I made from the
Army to <hi>Cracow; viz.</hi> from <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Fichau,</hi> call'd
by the Germans <hi>Wiſcho,</hi> four Leagues, two Stages,
which are very ſhort, through a pleaſant Champian
Country, wherein formerly there were three Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
like thoſe about <hi>Paris;</hi> which the <hi>Tartars</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
with the Ground.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Fichau</hi> to <hi>Mutſchultembourg</hi> four Leagues,

                  <p>From <hi>Mutſchultembourg</hi> to <hi>Presbourg</hi> two Leagues,
one Stage.</p>
                  <p>In leaving the firſt of theſe Places, one meets
with a Barrier of high Hills on the Right, which
ſhut up the Paſſage, and make a very narrow De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file,
between the Mountains and the <hi>Danube.</hi> A
League farther you paſs through another, ſtraiter
than the former; and that is, the Gate or Opening,
which is deſcry'd from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olkeſtorf,</hi> compos'd of two
ſteep Rocks, which on both ſides, ſituate one over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the other, ſtraiten the current of the <hi>Danube.</hi>
In the midway of this Paſſage is a large Town, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
with Stone Walls, with a lofty Gate, through
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54820:70"/>
which one enters into the Defile, there being no
other Entrance; for the <hi>Danube</hi> flows along on
the Left, and the Wall reaches on the Right, along
the Mountain to a Tower, that is ſeated on the
Top, the which is very high and ſteep. This
Place is call'd <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and might formerly have
been a well-built City; at preſent 'tis all in Ruines,
as well as the reſt. From thence one enters into a
pleaſant and fertile Plain, bounded on one ſide by
the River, and on the other ſide by thoſe Green
Hills, which opening wider and wider, gives a
large and boundleſs View of the fineſt Country
that can be imagin'd. At the City of <hi>Presbourg,</hi>
ſituate on the Left acroſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> you have the
moſt charming Proſpect and Landskip, that any
Painter can poſſibly invent or draw. One paſſes
the River on a Magnificent Floating-Bridge, large
enough for above ten Coaches, During the firſt
Campagne it was taken away, and a Ferry-Boat
only clap'd in its room. The next Year it was ſet
on the River again, and is certainly the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
Machine, and admirably well built; being
ſurrounded with Balliſters, or Rails on the Four
Sides. 'Tis ſo contriv'd, that one may walk upon
it as upon plain Ground, and is guided by the
Stream, without Oars or Helm, only with a Pully,
whoſe Cable is faſtened to a train of ſmall Boats,
that lye acroſs the River, at an equal diſtance from
each other.</p>
                  <p>The Reader will ſtill perceive the Retreat of

Bridges, which lay at <hi>Raab:</hi> and he will be able
to judge, Whether <hi>Miogensky,</hi> that Brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,

               <p>THE precipitate Retreat of the Grand Viſier
from before <hi>Vienna,</hi> could not be purſued,
for the Reaſons aſſign'd in the former Chapter:
So that he had Leiſure enough, to paſs his Bridges
at <hi>Raab,</hi> and to get to <hi>Buda,</hi> with the Remains of
his Army. He made a ſtand at that place, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of Danger; and the Letters which he
there receiv'd from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> with new Marks
of his Favour, and freſh Standards, comforted him
a little in his Misfortune. But being order'd to
cover the Frontiers, which his Defeat might have
laid open to the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Imperialiſts;</hi> he rally'd
his Forces, gave ſome Subſiſtence to the Soldiers,
rous'd up the Courage of the Commanders, that they
might be in a poſture of oppoſing the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in
caſe they were minded to proſecute their Victory,
and to lay Siege to any place within the Grand
Signior's Dominions. Tho' the Army was not
well ſatisfied with the Grand Viſier, who did not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54820:71"/>
duly pay them, and whoſe Pay was found in good
Ducats in his Cheſt, that were left to be rifl'd by
the King of <hi>Poland;</hi> yet they rallied without any
more ado, being animated with a Spirit of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metiſm,</hi>
which ſerves that Nation inſtead of true
Glory. The New <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> croſs'd the
<hi>Danube</hi> over the Bridge of <hi>Buda,</hi> and took poſſeſſion
of the City of <hi>Pest,</hi> with the Country round about
it, to ſerve as a cover from thence to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
where Count <hi>Teckley</hi> was advanc'd in the
Bottoms. He reinforc'd the Garriſons of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſel,</hi>
and <hi>Strigonium,</hi> and ſent a Body of Horſe to
the latter of theſe Places, there to paſs the Bridge,
and to guard that Paſs, where was a Fort of Earth
ſtaked and palliſſadoed, call'd <hi>Barcan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better comprehending of thoſe Motions,
by the Knowledge of the Country, you are to take
Notice, That the <hi>Danube</hi> joyning its Streams at
the Foot of the Citadel of <hi>Comorne,</hi> and at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of the Iſle of <hi>Schut,</hi> forms one ſingle and
large Channel, between great and open Plains on
the Left, and a narrow Mountainous and covert
Country on the Right, as far as <hi>Buda;</hi> being about
twelve Leagues diſtant from that Iſle: That theſe
Plains are full of Villages, large Towns and ſmall
Cities, whoſe Inhabitans manure the Land under
the Cannon of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> to which they contribute,
and whither they carry their Commodities to ſell.
The City is ſituated in the Centre of thoſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
Countries, and is the moſt advanc'd Place
which the <hi>Turks</hi> have on that ſide of <hi>Lower Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi>
The Country on the Right beyond the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,</hi>
is leſs fertile and manur'd, Mountainous and
Woody; yet Populous, having ſeveral ſtrong Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or Caſtles, which makes the Viſiriat of <hi>Buda.</hi>
The nigheſt of thoſe Places towards <hi>Germany,</hi> is
<hi>Strigonium,</hi> ſeated at the foot of a Hill almoſt on the
Banks of the <hi>Danube;</hi> and 'tis there where the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54820:72"/>
                  <hi>Turks</hi> have their firſt Bridge, to paſs over to the
Plains of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> and by this communication to
guard the Conquer'd Country. On the ſame ſide
with <hi>Strigonium</hi> lies the City of <hi>Buda,</hi> of the ſame
ſituation of the former, but a great deal more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
with ſuch another Bridge to paſs to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Hungary,</hi> and relieve the Places that are on that
ſide, at the foot of the Mountains. The Paſſes of
thoſe two Bridges are defended on the Left ſide of
the River; the firſt by a very great Fort, where
are abundance of Houſes, fortified with high Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſadoes,
with two Gates; but uncover'd, and liable
to be attack'd on all Sides: This Fort is call'd <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi>
The ſecond Bridge is defended by a large
fortified City, call'd <hi>Pest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas the <hi>Turks</hi> had been ſettled for above
140 Years in all this Country, which <hi>Solyman</hi> II.
ſirnam'd <hi>The Great,</hi> had in part conquer'd; thoſe
Places were look'd upon as the ancient Patrimony
of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> never dream'd of any
change either in Religion or Government. <hi>Buda</hi>
was the Capital City of <hi>Turkiſh Hungary,</hi> and
by the Forts with which it was either cover'd, or
ſurrounded within ſix Leagues of <hi>Comorne,</hi> it might
paſs for the Centre of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. Upon
this account it was, that the Viſier there made a
ſtand, and <hi>Rendevouz'd</hi> his new Army. He took
up his Quarters there, with the beſt part of the
Army, thereby to cover the Frontiers of that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiriat;
and ſent the reſt croſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> to guard
the Paſſes of the two Bridges, that they might be
in a Readineſs to hinder the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
in the Plains of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> or towards the
Neighbouring Mountains. This is the <hi>Ichnography</hi>
of the Country in General, let us deſcend to that
of the Places contain'd in it in Particular.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Strigonium,</hi> call'd by the <hi>Germans Gran,</hi> by the
<hi>Italians Grana,</hi> by the Inhabitants <hi>Eſtregon,</hi> from
whence the <hi>Turks</hi> have nam'd it <hi>Oſtrogon,</hi> is a
City whoſe Houſes are built with Wood. It is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
at the foot of a large Mountain, which the
<hi>Danube</hi> waſhes; inclos'd with Stone Walls, pretty
well built, having Turrets and Batteries on them,
but without a Trench, or any other kind of Defence.
On the Top is a Fortreſs, call'd the Upper Town,
where the Governour and his Garriſon are quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:
This Fortreſs has no other Fortifications,
beſide very thick Walls, well built and Rampier'd,
defended with Towers, Angles, and other ancient
Flankers, by which the Walls of the Lower Town
are joyn'd to thoſe of the Upper. That ſide which
faces the <hi>Danube,</hi> is very pleaſant, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of the Lower City with the Fortreſs
very eaſie by paths, than run along the Deſcent
to a ſmall Gate: But the ſide which looks towards
the Champian Country is very ſteep on the Top,
where is a Rocky Creſt that ſurrounds the Fort
and its Walls; at the foot of which is a Palliſade
in the nature of a Counterſcarp; to keep off the
Enemy. For as ſoon one has gain'd the foot of
thoſe Walls, he is cover'd from all the Attempts of
thoſe that are upon them. Over againſt this ſide
is juſt ſuch another Mountain, parallel to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and call'd in <hi>German Thomasberg,</hi> where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
was a ſort of Fortreſs, of which nothing is
now remaining but the Foundations, and from
whence one might cannonade that of <hi>Strigonium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lower City had ſeveral Houſes in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
upon the Plain; a Moſque upon the Bank
of the <hi>Danube</hi> near the Bridge, to which they went
through a ſmall Gate, open'd in the Wall over
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54820:73"/>
againſt it. This Bridge was one of the longeſt that
ever was ſeen; the middle built on Boats, the two
ends on Piles. The River is of an extraordinary
Breadth, its Banks pleaſant, its Current running
in a ſtrait line, the paſſage all about of wonderful
variety. It was formerly a conſiderable Arch-Biſhoprick,
whoſe Title is ſtill beſtow'd on Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
of high Dignity: And of late Years, we have
met in the Learned World with an Archbiſhop
of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> whoſe Writings have furniſh'd mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Diſpute to the moſt Famous Univerſities of
<hi>Europe,</hi> and have eſtabliſh'd a laſting Reputation to
their Author. This City is ſtill the Metropolis
of a Country of a large Extent, which made up
one of the beſt parts of the ancient Kingdom of
<hi>Hungary.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Buda</hi> was the Capital thereof, and the Reſidence
of the King, who had there a Magnificent Palace.
It lies below <hi>Strigonium,</hi> ſix large Leagues, and on
the ſame ſide, divided into the Upper and Lower
Town; the latter ſeated on the Declivity and at
the Foot of a large Mountain; the former ſtretch'd
out on the Top of it, where it ſtands; being very
narrow about the middle, but very long, and the
two Extremities widened out like <hi>Places-d' Armes.</hi>
Neither of theſe Towns have any Fortifications:
The Lower Town is inclos'd only with Walls;
the Upper flank'd with round Towers, with a
good Trench, a double Circumvallation in ſeveral
parts of the Ancient Mode, and with thoſe Pallaces
of King <hi>Matthias</hi> at the end, which enters into
the very Subſtance of the Walls, and make a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
part of them. The whole is built with Brick,
and well rampier'd, yet of eaſie Acceſs, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
of the Mountain not being very rough, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54820:73"/>
the Top being almoſt all of it commanded by other
Riſings, proper to mount Cannon on. The River
runs behind that Hill on which the City ſtands, ſo
that one cannot get betwixt them: and to cut off
their Supplies, one muſt either ſeiſe upon <hi>Pest,</hi> which
is on the other ſide at the Head of the Bridge, or
ſtop up the <hi>Danube</hi> below <hi>Buda,</hi> towards the Iſle
of <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> which is not far from thence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> call the Place <hi>Boudim,</hi> and have made
it the Title of a Viſier: I likewiſe look upon it as
one of the Chief Viſiriats by the Extent of its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the Importance of the Province,
which is one of the richeſt and largeſt of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire; which comprehends the whole
courſe of the <hi>Drave,</hi> a very conſiderable River,
upon which or its Marſhes on each ſide, is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> of near two hundred Leagues
Length; and which opens a Paſſage into <hi>Servia,
Bulgaria, Boſnia,</hi> and other Ancient Provinces of
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions. The Province of <hi>Buda</hi>
made a great part of <hi>Lower Hungary,</hi> and one of
the Ancient <hi>Pannonienſes,</hi> ſtretching it ſelf from

for two hundred Years together; ſtill it

of certain rich Grapes dry'd in the Sun, call'd
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vae ſiccae, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vae paſſae.</hi> The Fruits of the Country

ſuitable to the Conſtitution of an Humane Body,
that the <hi>Phyſicians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

ſo much boaſted of in hot Countries, grow here in
great plenty: Water Melons, and others on dry
Land, without meeting with ſo much as one of
'em naught. And there are three or four ſorts of
them, or of different colours, being white, green,
red within.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hungary</hi> abounds no leſs in all other things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
for the Pleaſure or Neceſſities of Life, ſo that it
needs not to borrow any thing from its Neighbors,
but on the contrary can lend to them of its own
ſtores. This has render'd it very populous, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
it with great Cities, large Towns, and ſtately
Caſtles. Moſt of the firſt owe their Original to
the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> who planted Colonies in this
Country; the Names of which are ſtill retain'd in
that general corruption of Languages. Such are
<hi>Poſon, Sabine,</hi> and <hi>Tyrnau,</hi> which are Famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this Kingdom, founded formerly by <hi>Piſo, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus</hi>

Time is not degenerated neither in the Stile,

                  <p>There is ſcarce any Kingdom, that has ſo many
conſiderable Nobility, Rich Lords, and Powerful
Families; which appears from thoſe frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
that have happen'd in that Country: and
in our Days from that Rebellion rais'd by the
Counts <hi>Nadaſti, Fragipani,</hi> and <hi>Serin;</hi> whoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
contrary to the Edict of Amneſties and
Impunities, has fomented it again in the Perſon of
Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> who inherits the Hatred which his
Anceſtors bore to the Tyranny and Cruelty of

ruin'd this vaſt Territory; partly on their own
Head, and partly to relieve the Rebels. From

Not only the Genius of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who
are Naturally Treacherous, and inclin'd to rebel;
not only the Riches of the Lords, and the Fiery
and Haughty Temper of the Nation, but withall
the Arrogance of the <hi>German</hi> Governours contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
very much to thoſe Revolts. All the World
knows what great Generals and Commanders this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54820:75"/>
Country has bred up, who were for a long time
the ſtrongeſt Bulwark <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> had againſt the
<hi>Infidels:</hi> Hiſtories are full of the Noble Actions,
Memorable Battels and Sieges, which have rais'd
the Reputation of this Kingdom to a great Height,
by the Valour of its Kings or Generals, both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Modern: So that their Bravery has been
perpetuated in all Ages, and even nouriſh'd by the
War of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who could never have advanc'd
their Conqueſt ſo far, had not Rebellion and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
Diviſions open'd a way to them. Thoſe of
<hi>Flanders</hi> have met with a Famous Hiſtorian <hi>[Strada]</hi>
by whoſe Help, they have merited the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Ages: But the Wars of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which
are longer and more bloody, would have been
more memorable, if a faihtful and well-inform'd
Hiſtorian had wrote the Particulars of them.</p>
                  <p>This Kingdom formerly contain'd ten Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
whoſe Standards were ſet up (as at preſent)
at the Coronation of the Kings: <hi>Sclavonia, Servia,
Boſnia, Croatia,</hi> and other Countries of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Illyricum,</hi> were dependent upon it. <hi>Vienna</hi>
ſtill pretends, That the Principality of <hi>Tranſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi>
was one of its Provinces: but this laſt is at
preſent a particular Soveraignty of it ſelf; and the
<hi>Turks</hi> have added the reſt to the Empire of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi>
So that we are to look upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in its preſent State, as 'tis bounded by <hi>Poland,
Tranſylvania, Talachia, Servia, Croatia</hi> and <hi>Auſtria;</hi>
containing in this vaſt Circumference, two different
Countries, which the <hi>Danube</hi> cuts aſunder, and
wholly ſeparates: the One call'd <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary,</hi>
which conſiſts of Mountains, Hills, and Valleys;
the other, <hi>Lower Hungary,</hi> ſtretching it ſelf along
vaſt, fertile and pleaſant Plains, from the Right
ſide of the River, taking in thoſe great Iſles which
it forms from <hi>Presbourg.</hi> Both theſe Countries are
waſh'd with great Rivers, enrich'd with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54820:75"/>
Cities, and fortified with Forts and Caſtles.
But the beſt Canton is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary,</hi> as the <hi>Lower</hi>
is the moſt pleaſant. The Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> had
poſſeſſion of the former a long time, and refus'd not
to pay their Obedience to the Emperors of that
Warlike Nation, which coſts them no leſs than the
<hi>Gauls.</hi> It was <hi>Pannonia,</hi> a Province of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, where thoſe Lords of the Univerſe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
themſelves, planted Colonies, and kept up
Armies, being very well ſatisfied with the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Soil, the goodneſs of the Climate, and the
conſiderableneſs of its Situation. There are ſtill to
be found a vaſt number of Medals; the old Ruines
are full of 'em; the Foundations of the Cities were
the Treaſuries of 'em, where the People doubtleſs
did hide them, either in time of War, or out of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,
as in other Parts. Thoſe who would
write a Hiſtory by thoſe Ancient Coyns or Medals,
cannot meet any where elſe with ſo many, and ſo
fine pieces, ſo well ſtamp'd and preſerv'd as are
to be met with in this Kingdom, and in <hi>Tranſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania.</hi>
In the Year 1685. I brought to his <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Majeſty above two thuoſand Pieces of Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
gather'd in that Country, at the Inſtance of
the Marquis of <hi>Bethune,</hi> by the care of ſeveral
Lords of his Acquaintance, and among the reſt of

fortify'd <hi>Nyſſa,</hi> in the 1619, Count <hi>Veterani</hi> colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
an infinite number of very Curious Medals,

                  <p>Beſides this general Diviſion of <hi>Hungary;</hi> there
is another particular one with reſpect to its Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reingty,

Governed by a Viſier, called from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City of it, the <hi>Viſier of Buda.</hi> In <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-Hungary,</hi>
they carried on their Conqueſts beyond
the <hi>Theyſſe,</hi> skirting on <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
into the very heart of the Kingdom, where
they took Poſſeſſion of <hi>Temeſwar, Peterwaradin,</hi>
and other Parts, of which they made a ſecond
Province, under the Title of the firſt of thoſe
Cities. The reſt towards <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Moravia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
to the Emperor or the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi>
but very much curtailed by the Rebels; and the
ſtrong places which the Grandees held out: So
that when the <hi>Turks</hi> came to <hi>Vienna,</hi> only <hi>Zatmar</hi>
towards <hi>Poland,</hi> and ſome other inconſiderable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which that Fortreſs likewiſe covered, were
under the Obedience of the Emperor. The State
of War indeed changed the Diſpoſition after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as we ſhall ſee; but thus it was in this year
I now ſpeak of, after the Raiſing of the Siege of
<hi>Vienna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Grand Viſier rallied the broken Forces
of his Army at <hi>Buda,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland</hi> marched vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriouſly
with his towards <hi>Lower-Hungary,</hi> on the
Right of the River <hi>Danube,</hi> on which they cauſed
the Bridge of <hi>Toulm</hi> to fall down, and to be placed
below <hi>Presbourg</hi> to paſs over into the Iſle of <hi>Schut.</hi>
This Iſle they traverſed from one end to the other
in ſeveral diſtinct Camps, as hath been already ſaid,
to the City of <hi>Komorne,</hi> which is at the point of
that Iſle: Over againſt which, and on the left
Branch of the <hi>Danube</hi> the ſame Bridge was
brought down to paſs over into the plains of
<hi>Newhauſel,</hi> which they had a deſign to beſiege.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54820:76"/>
A League lower another Bridge was caſt over on
<hi>Presbourg</hi> ſide, to maintain a Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this City with the Army, and the Iſle of
<hi>Schut;</hi> the only Road that could be Travelled
with any ſafety, and to facilitate that of the City
<hi>Komorne,</hi> which was ſeated at the farther end of the
Iſland.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> left the Iſle <hi>October</hi> 3. and
Encamped beyond it under the Cannon of that
Fortreſs, facing towards <hi>Newhauſel</hi> on the Left,
leaving ſpace on the Right for the <hi>German</hi> Army,
who arrived the next Day near the City, and
paſſed the Bridge the ſame Day, and all the fifth;
which obliged the King to make a ſtand in that
place to the ſixth, that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> might
have time to draw over all his Forces. However
the Imperial Artillery, and the Regiments of the
<hi>Cravatians</hi> could not paſs over till this Day; and
the Army was forced ſtill to Halt. But our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and our <hi>Coſſacks</hi> having brought News the
Night before, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were likewiſe paſſing
the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Peſt</hi> and <hi>Barean,</hi> to put a ſtop to our
March, and cover <hi>Newhauſel, Lewents,</hi> and the
Country that lay at the foot of the Mountains;
the King reſolved upon Marching directly to the
Bridge of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> to burn it, before the Enemy
could all get over to us, and to carry the Fort which
lay at the head of the Bridge by the Vanguard with
Sword in Hand. In the mean time he took a view
of the Rounds of his Camp of <hi>Komorne,</hi> to deſcry the
Avenues and the Diſpoſition of the Ground. He
ſent a <hi>French</hi> Engineer, named <hi>M. du Pont,</hi> with a
great Party of Horſe towards <hi>Lewents,</hi> with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to advance as nigh as he could to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Army. His <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were likewiſe ordered
forth towards the <hi>Danube;</hi> one of whom brought
a <hi>Turk,</hi> who was advanced but only twenty paces
from the Main-Guard of the Enemies Camp.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54820:77"/>
The Engineer returned without having diſcover'd
any thing; becauſe his Guides had led him all the
Night without coming nigh either of the Bridges;
on the contrary they brought him towards <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſel,</hi>
by the Walls of which he marched. But
another Officer committed a greater Error; for
being commanded to go as far <hi>Barcan,</hi> he ſtopp'd
in a Village half-way, where he ſpent the greateſt
part of the Night; a Detachment of the <hi>Turks</hi>
ſurprized him, cut off his Head, with thirty Horſe
that attended him, whoſe Trunks we ſaw the next
Day as we paſſed through that Village. So that the
King could never get any certain Intelligence what
number of <hi>Turks</hi> had croſſed on this ſide of the
River, nor where their particular Poſt was. We
could plainly ſee the Fires which they made in
the Villages upon the Road, thereby to cut off
from us both Wood and Forrage, the former of
which was very ſcarce in thoſe Plains: We were
informed by the Priſoners that marched on the
ſide of us; that the <hi>Tartars</hi> were advanced by the
way of <hi>Pest,</hi> and were to join the Rebels of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
led by Count <hi>Teckly</hi> along the Mountains;
but we knew nothing of what paſt at <hi>Barcan.</hi>
This Poſt was very ſtill undiſcovered, and the King
was ill adviſed to think of carrying the Place by
his Dragoons and Infantry, without communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any thing of his Deſign to the <hi>Germans,</hi> that
he might let them ſee that the <hi>Poles</hi> knew how to
carry conſiderable Forts by ſurprize.</p>
                  <p>Full of this deſign, he urged the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
to decamp from <hi>Komorne,</hi> and advance towards
the Bridges of the of the <hi>Turks,</hi> under a pretence
of burning them, without letting him know any
of his Real intentions. But the Imperial Army
could not yet break up, ſince their Cannon and
part of the Cavalry was ſtill ſtopp'd in the Iſle, by
the breaking of part of the Bridge, which was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54820:77"/>
repairing all the fifth Day. On <hi>October</hi> 6. about
Nine in the Morning they decamped without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the coming up of the reſt; and in that
very inſtant the King received advice that <hi>Teckley</hi>
being informed of his March was retreated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> having gained the Mountains.
This redoubled his Deſire of advancing towards
the Enemy, which they did this very Day within
two ſhort Leagues off the Fort of <hi>Barcan,</hi> having
marched three large Leagues.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Tranſactions the Queen of <hi>Poland,</hi>
to whom the King had ſent me with a very large
Account of the Particulars of <hi>Vienna,</hi> diſpatch'd me
back again with her Anſwers, and order'd me par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to inſinuate to the King, by means of the
Senators that follow'd the Camp, that it was high
time to return back to his Dominions. This the
<hi>Poles</hi> paſſionately long'd for, becauſe the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
began to be out of Heart, for want of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
particularly Bread; for which the <hi>Germans</hi>
cannot be excus'd, having the conveniency of the
<hi>Danube,</hi> by which they might have convey'd great
plenty into the Camp; had they us'd due Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Beſides this, the <hi>Poles</hi> thought they were
at the fag-end of the World, and long'd for their
Beer, their Colworts, and their <hi>Cacha,</hi> without
which they fancy'd they could not live. But the
King would liſten to none of theſe Conſiderations,
and with a ſteddy Reſolution, purſu'd that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Carreer, which he had form'd in his Mind,
from the Banks of the <hi>Danub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>I met with the <hi>German</hi> Army, in the Iſle of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morne;</hi>
and becauſe I could not tell for certain
where the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army was, which always march'd
two or three Leagues in the Van; I reſolv'd at
<hi>Presbourg</hi> to follow a Courrier from the Emperor,
that was going thence to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> from
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54820:78"/>
whom I expected to receive a Convoy. After 4
Hours march we found the Arrier-Guard, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of the <hi>Cravatian</hi> Regiments: We went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by the courſe of the Country, towards
the Place, where they told us the Main Body of the
Army lay; but we turn'd too much towards the
the Left, and fell in with the Camp of the Infantry,
commanded by <hi>Staremberg,</hi> which coaſted along
the Left Arm of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and encamp'd this
Day upon the Shore about <hi>Goutta,</hi> a ſmall City
over againſt <hi>Newhauſel.</hi> By this means we could
not get before Midnight to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s
Camp, poſted about the Middle of the Iſle, four
large Leagues off <hi>Komorne,</hi> being two Days March
to that City.</p>
                  <p>On the Morrow, being Sunday <hi>Octob.</hi> 3. I waited
upon the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> at his <hi>Levée;</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
me, That the King was this very Day to
paſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> over the Bridge of <hi>Komorne,</hi> his
Army being march'd over the Day before. That
Prince order'd me to be conducted thither, by one of
his Adjutants, upon Horſes belonging to his own
Equipage. I arriv'd at the Bridge that very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
the King paſs'd it: and his Majeſty, who had
order'd me to rejoyn him by coming that Road, in
which he was purſuing the Enemy, was ſurpris'd,
and at the ſame time glad, to ſee me arrive ſo ſafe
to his Camp. During the Halt he made there, he
receiv'd an Expreſs from the Prince of <hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
with Letters writ in Cyphers, dated at <hi>Buda,</hi>
which contain'd little elſe but the Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Grand Viſier in his former Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Particulars of the whole Intrigue at
Court. Much about the ſame time there arriv'd
two Envoys from Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> their Maſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
minded to adjuſt his own Particular Intereſts
with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> when he perceiv'd the
contrary Party ſo apparently to decline. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54820:78"/>
Miniſters, who were near his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty's
Perſon, were at firſt for treating thoſe Envoys as
Rebels, and talk'd of nothing but hanging, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and quartering them, without any reſpect had
to the preſence of their Deliverer, who had put
them into a poſture of ſpeaking ſo big. But the
King, nettled at ſuch a groundleſs and unſeaſonable
a piece of Arrogance, gave 'em to underſtand,
That he was the Maſter, and ſolemn Protector of
all thoſe, who had any Negotiations with Him.
Thoſe Envoys quarter'd in the Camp within the
King's Lodgments, all the time that the Army
tarry'd there, were treated by the Officers, and
ſent back with all the Aſſurances imaginable; which
piece of Civility, Count <hi>Teckley</hi> afterward repay'd
Him with Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 6. the Army (as was ſaid before) advanc'd
three Leagues beyond <hi>Komorne,</hi> and encamp'd in
the open Plains, bounded on the Left by a ridge
of Hills, and on the Right by the <hi>Danube:</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> made a Propoſal to the King of
ſtaying there <hi>October</hi> 7, to wait for the Infantry,
who were not yet come up, and the King yielded
to it: So that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> retiring about
Midnight to his Quarters, and the Chevalier Prince
<hi>Lubomirsky</hi> waiting upon him for Orders, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him with the Reſolution taken of ſtaying
there; and accordingly order'd all Parts to go out a
Forraging. But a Moment after, the King changing
his Mind, or fortified afreſh, by ſome unknown
Circumſtance, in his Deſign of going to attack
the Fort of <hi>Barcan,</hi> he gave Orders to his Generals
to diſlodge the Army by Break of Day, and to
ſend before his Vanguard, reinforc'd with Horſe
and Dragoons, which were to march directly to
that Poſt. The Chevalier <hi>Lubomirsky,</hi> retain'd
by ſome ſecret Impulſe, would not ſend out to
Forrage, without ſending again to the Duke of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54820:79"/>
                     <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Quarters; and his Conjecture prov'd
true, the Duke ordering him to march with all
ſpeed after the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who was already
advanc'd a great way. Such a deſperate Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſtunn'd the <hi>German</hi> Generals, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
by none: However, they decamp'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
weighing things, but not without murmuring
and inwardly rejoycing at the Misfortune, which
afterwards attended our preſumptuous Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> had two Days before paſs'd over the
Bridge of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> and beſide thoſe who were
lodg'd in the Fort, there were great Platoons poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Gardens and Orchards round about <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can:</hi>
Of this the King of <hi>Poland</hi> was not aware,
but was well pleas'd to rob the <hi>Germans</hi> of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this Expedition, and of carrying the Place
within their View, and without their Aſſiſtance.
But God was pleas'd to mortifie this Hero by a
contrary Succeſs, and to let him know that the
Diſpoſal of the whole was in his Hands; having
ſav'd his Sacred Perſon, by a Miracle no leſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
than that of the Deliverance of <hi>Vienna,</hi>
the Glory whereof, if unblemiſh'd, might perhaps
have made the <hi>Poles</hi> too vain-glorious.</p>
                  <p>The Van-Guard was ſcarce arriv'd upon the
Plains, above the Bottom ſtretch'd out to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and the Fort, where they were to encamp
on this Day, but the <hi>Turks</hi> began to draw out of
the Gardens, in order to skirmiſh with our Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons.
At firſt their Number was inconſiderable,
but large Squadrons iſſu'd out inſenſibly: Some
out of the Fort, others over the Bridge marching
from <hi>Strigonium;</hi> and at laſt the Body of Troops
thus increas'd, came thundring upon the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Van-Guard,
who had not ſo much as time to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a Poſture of Fighting. Horror and
Confuſion ſeis'd their Spirits; no Officer to be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54820:79"/>
ſeen, no Word of Command given; and thoſe who
did give any, were ſo little Maſters of themſelves,
that they order'd the Dragoons ſome to diſmount,
ſome to remount, without any reaſon for either
of theſe Counter-Orders. For they were open
Plains, where the Infantry was expos'd to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Fury and Impetuoſity of the <hi>Turks.</hi> They
therefore drew themſelves up in a confus'd Line
of Battle; the Troops of <hi>Pancernes, Coſacks,</hi> and
other Cavalry, deſcended below the Curtain,
whoſe Brow the Dragoons were in poſſeſſion of
in the ſame Line: the <hi>Stragenic,</hi> who commanded
the Body in Perſon, caus'd a diſcarge to be made
upon the Enemy, who bore upon them with an
extraordinary violence. The <hi>Turks</hi> at firſt gave
ground, but ſoon return'd upon that Body of
Horſe with the ſame Vigour, without fearing the
Fire, of which they bore a ſecond Diſcharge,
after which the <hi>Coſacks</hi> were broke; the reſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to regain the top of the Curtain, and
terror joyn'd with the Impetuoſity of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
routed the whole Line without reſiſtance. The
Dragoons of the Grand General remounted, in
order to fly for it; thoſe belonging to the King,
who were on the Right, had not time to do it, and
were all cut in pieces.</p>
                  <p>However, the King march'd on with the
<hi>Huſſars,</hi> and the other Troops of Horſe, who were
but little prepar'd for a Battle, which they had
no leiſure now to wait for. He ſaw at a diſtance
the Diſorder of his defeated Vant-Guard, which
at firſt he would have diſſembled; but at laſt,
perceiving that they were vigorouſly beaten off,
he put himſelf in a poſture of defending them.
He drew up his Cavalry in a Line, which upon the
firſt Onſet, receiv'd the <hi>Turks</hi> with a great deal of
Bravery, the <hi>Huſſars</hi> likewiſe charg'd them twice,
and the reſt of the Troops bore ſome time the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54820:80"/>
terrible Shock of the Enemy, who were animated
by their firſt Succeſs. But their Squadrons ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
out to the Right and Left, with a deſign of
ſurrounding our whole Line, our Left Wing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſorder'd, began to give ground, and the
Right being routed, at the third Onſet, which the
<hi>Turks</hi> made upon them, with their Sabres in their
Hands, (for that was all the Weapon they made
uſe of in this Tranſaction) fac'd about at the ſame
time, to avoid the Fury of the Enemy. The Grand
General, ſeeing the Diſorder, pray'd his Majeſty
to retreat, whilſt he would endeavour to bear
the Charge of the <hi>Turks,</hi> with ſome rally'd Troops,
to cover his Sacred Perſon. But that Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeldom us'd to ſuch a Retreat, receiv'd the
Propoſal very ill, and ſtill fought on, till the
Croud of thoſe who fled, carry'd him off in ſpight
of his Teeth. Never ſuch a Confuſion was ſeen, The
<hi>Huſſars</hi> threw away their Lances, the Cornets their
Standards, which one might ſee heap'd up pel-mell,
with the Kettle-drums in the Furrows. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
could not be ſo much as hearken'd to: thoſe
Brave Soldiers left the King to the mercy of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> who eagerly purſu'd him. Some of the
Soldiers were for Butchering the Leaders, that
would have forc'd them to rally: and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to thoſe who upbraided them for their Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe,
<hi>That their Lives were as precious to them as the
King's was to him; that if he came thither to be kill'd
or taken, they had ſome thing elſe to do with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſuch a precipitate Flight over a Country broke
up into large Furrows, and full of rough ways, it
was the Misfortune of a great many Men to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors'd,
who were either cruſh'd to pieces by the
croud of thoſe who fled, or beheaded by the
<hi>Turks.</hi> Prince <hi>Lubomirsky,</hi> who has been ſince
made Great Squire of the Crown, was caſt upon
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54820:80"/>
the Ground, and deſir'd every one that paſs'd by,
to ſave his Life, for which he promis'd 100000 Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats;
and was at laſt aſſiſted by a Groom, that had
a Led-Horſe in his Hand, which he had juſt time
to mount. The Palatin of <hi>Pomerania d' Henoff,</hi> had
not ſo good Luck, for he was wounded with a
Musket-ſhot, notwithſtanding the Waſtcoat he
had on, quilted with Taffata Cotton, 1000 or 1200
times double, which he had prefer'd before Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that could not be fitted to his fat Corps.
This Lord lying upon his Horſe, and incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with his Wound, was aſſiſted in vain by 7 or
8 of his faithful Domeſticks, who could not fix
him again in his Saddle; he intreated them to
leave him upon the Ground, where he had not
reſted long, but the <hi>Turks</hi> came and cut off his
Head. Whereas moſt of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army were
<hi>Boſnians,</hi> whoſe Language has ſome affinity to the
<hi>Poliſh,</hi> and ſome of 'em perhaps had learn'd it in
Slavery, or were <hi>Poliſh</hi> Renegadoes; you might
hear them caſt a thouſand Flouts and Reproches
on our Men that fled: <hi>Go, get ye home</hi> (cry'd they)
<hi>to your own Country; defend that, and never concern
your ſelves in aſſiſting others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this dreadful Rout the King's Perſon was not
only abandon'd, but almoſt ſtiffl'd by the Croud,
that carry'd him along: His Arms and Thighs
were mortify'd and bruis'd, by the juſtling of
Horſes and Arms, and by the Blows he acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
receiv'd from thoſe that ruſh'd by him with
all the violence imaginable. At laſt two <hi>Turks</hi>
made up to him, one of 'em lift up his Sabre within
four Inches of his Neck, and had certainly cut off
his Head, if a <hi>Reyter,</hi> belonging to the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Guards, had not very luckily interpos'd,
and knock'd the <hi>Turk</hi> down dead with his Musket.
But this Life-guard's Man did not long enjoy the
Glory of ſuch a Signal piece of Service; for the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54820:81"/>
                     <hi>Turk</hi>'s Comrade, coming up to him immediately
reveng'd the other's Death, and cut off the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<hi>Reyter</hi>'s Head, whoſe Name we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
get any knowledge of. At the ſame time the
<hi>Turk</hi> made towards the King, whom he only took
for ſome great Lord; but the great Squire of the
Crown, keeping cloſe to his Friend and Maſter,
preſented a Piſtol ready cock'd to the <hi>Turk</hi>'s
Breaſt, which he was not willing to diſcharge but
upon ſure grounds; and thus by this Bold and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
piece of Bravery, he ſcar'd him away.</p>
                  <p>But this was not the only Danger to which the
King of <hi>Poland</hi> was expos'd, on this fatal Day.
He was ſo bulky, that ſcarce a Horſe could be
met with capable of carrying him ſuch a Journey,
Beſides, his very Weight was enough to bear down
the ſtrongeſt Steed, eſpecially in ſuch deep Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
through heaps of Dead Bodies, unhors'd
Cavaliers, Lances, Standards, and Kettle-drums,
which being ſtrow'd in the Way, made a ſort of
Barricade. However, the Horſe upon which his
Majeſty was mounted in this Juncture, kept up his
Spirits beyond Expectation, and not only leapt
over thoſe embaraſſing heaps, that lay ſo thick in
the way, with eaſe and Vigour; but alſo finiſh'd
his Journey, without panting or blowing, without
ſtumbling or halting; and with ſuch Speed, that
the King could ſcarce breath, much leſs was
he able to keep upon his back. Whereupon turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards his Faithful Friend, the Grand Squire,
to tell him he was quite ſpent; the Squire made him
drop the Reins on the Neck of the Horſe, of which
he was well ſecur'd, and took the King below the
Right Arm, and a Gentleman of <hi>Lithuania</hi> nam'd
<hi>Cherkas,</hi> took him by the Left, to hold him up in
his Saddle; which thoſe Gentlemen did to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
laſt, without parting from their Maſter, whoſe
Life by this means was ſav'd; eſpecially the Grand
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54820:81"/>
Squire, who with his other Hand held up the King's
Head by the Chin, that he might not be ſtiffled or
ſuffocated, by letting it lye upon his Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Amidſt all the direful thoughts, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ran in the Head of this Monarch, amidſt thoſe
various Chances of an adverſe Fortune; he could
not get rid of the Fear he was in for the Prince his
Son, ever ſince the beginning of the Defeat. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Moment, he ask'd the Grand Squire, what was
become of him, who endeavour'd to keep up his
Spirits, by telling him, That the Prince was ſafe,
tho' he was not certain of any ſuch thing. 'Tis
true, the Crowd preſs'd upon him, and bore him off
on the Right, out of the Road, which the King
his Father took. A <hi>Turk</hi> had already joyn'd him,
and catch'd hold of his Coat; but the Grand Squire
perceiving it, cry'd out to him to unbutton it, and
to clap both Spurs to his Horſe, which the Prince
did very opportunely. By this means he got out
of the Hands of this firſt <hi>Turk,</hi> and eſcap'd the
reſt, by marching more towards the Right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
follow'd only by one <hi>French</hi> Gentleman of his
Houſhold, who alſo took another Road. The
Prince reach'd very ſeaſonably a demoliſh'd Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
that lay towards the Hills, where the Grand
Squire ſaw him arrive, having kept his Eye always
upon him, and whither they ſent for him after
the Retreat of the Enemy, who purſu'd the <hi>Poles</hi>
ſo vigorouſly for about half a large <hi>Hungarian</hi>
League.</p>
                  <p>They had perhaps carry'd the Purſuit farther,
had it not been for the Arrival of our Infantry,
Cannon, and Carriages, whoſe Main-Body char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them, and put a ſtop to their Carreer. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſome of 'em ſtill puſh'd on in their Chariots,
who return'd back with full ſpeed, by marching
towards the <hi>Danube.</hi> In this unlucky Juncture,
a Gentleman belonging to the King being ſick,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54820:82"/>
and in a Calaſh, was forc'd to fly for it acroſs the
rough Plough'd Lands, and being bruis'd with the
Jolts of his Litter, died by that time he had drove
100 Paces. In ſhort, all things were in a dreadful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and confuſion. The Commanders of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
who march'd at the Head of the Infantry,
caus'd ſeveral Cannons to be diſcharg'd at radom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot,
to put a ſtop to the Impetuoſity of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
At laſt, the Imperial Army appear'd, and
the <hi>Turks</hi> not daring to engage any farther with
thoſe Forces, that ſurmounted them in Number,
made a gradual Retreat, over that Curtain
where they had begun to defeat the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Van-Guard,
gathering up in the Fields of Battle the
Chief Perſonages, the Lances, Standards, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
at the Top of which they faſtened all the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> Heads, that were kill'd in the Action,
and plac'd them round the Fort of <hi>Barcan,</hi> like ſo
many Palliſadoes.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not poſſible to deſcribe the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
our Army was in, or the Sorrow of the
Court. The King almoſt dead with the Fatigue,
weak, and out of Breath, was laid on the Ground
upon a little Hay, ſurrounded with his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lords
that had eſcap'd the Slaughter, all of 'em in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
poſture, with pale Countenances, and
Eyes fix'd on the Ground. A ſad and mournful
Silence poſſeſs'd the Troops, who this Day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
without any Order, being rather diſpers'd
in the Open Fields, than lodg'd in a mark'd-out
Ground; for, in truth, we had no other place to
encamp in, but that which the <hi>Turks</hi> had allow'd
us to take breath in; a great way ſhort of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Camp, which now ſerv'd as a Burying-place,
to our unfortunate Comrades.</p>
                  <p>After this the <hi>German</hi> Generals arriv'd, who
ſtood round the King, with an external Aſpect
ſuitable to the Misfortune of the Day; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54820:82"/>
raviſh'd at the Loſs, which ſo much ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſed
the Glory gain'd by delivering <hi>Vienna.</hi> One
might read even in their feign'd and mask'd looks,
a ſecret Joy which Emulation ſtirr'd up, and which
Ingratitude render'd more delightful. 'Tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> might have more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Thoughts; and I am perſwaded, That the
publick Intereſt, his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty's Perſon, and
the Honour of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Arms, inſpir'd into
him a true Sorrow: but the manner whereby this
Enterprize was kept ſecret from him, That haughty
Air which was affected in the Execution of it, and
that Vaunting which had been made of the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Troops, could not chuſe but
make him reliſh ſome Comfort, even in the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of this Day. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> could
not ſpeak a Word to him, and with much ado,
lifted up his Eyes at the Arrival of the Prince
his Son, whom the Grand Squire had conducted
to him, to remove the Dejection of his Spirits.
There was no farther Order given this Night, but
only to encamp in the Bottom, between the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
along the <hi>Danube,</hi> and to take care of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Dead forthwith, to cover the Shame of our
Defeat, which was but too conſiderable in the Van-Guard.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Turks</hi> puffed up with this
Succeſs, ſent Expreſſes all Night to <hi>Buda,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi> therewith, and deſire him
to ſend them a Reinforcement, that ſo they might
conclude, by cutting off the <hi>Germans</hi> which they
fancy'd they might do at a cheap rate. They
ſent the ſame News to Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> who was
fortified about the Mountains; giving him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that if he had reaſons hitherto of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimenting
the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> they were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
by the entire Defeat of his Army, in which
himſelf had been kill'd, perhaps taken: That none
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54820:83"/>
remain'd of that great Body of Troops, but the
<hi>Germans,</hi> his mortal Enemies, whom he might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
get himſelf rid of, if he would but make haſte
with his Army, which they earneſtly deſir'd him
to do. This News that was ſent to Count <hi>Teckley</hi>
and the Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> had different Impreſſions on
the Minds of thoſe two Generals. The <hi>Ottoman</hi>
General forgot his Flight, and thought he might
wipe off the Diſgrace of that by a Second Battle.
To this Purpoſe, he order'd 12 or 15000 Horſe
to march to <hi>Strigonium,</hi> with <hi>Anchars,</hi> or Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
arm'd with Carabines, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Two <hi>Viſiers,</hi> and Four other <hi>Baſſas,</hi> who
had Injunctions to paſs the Bridge, and immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
to fall Hand-over-head upon the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
without needleſly diſputing the Ground with
them; that ſo by this bold Enterprize, they might
add the laſt Stroke to the Pannick Fear of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Day. This I learn'd from one of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers,</hi>
who was taken in this Action. Count <hi>Teckley</hi>
receiv'd the News of our Misfortune with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Thoughts. He did not deſire the <hi>Turks</hi>
ſhould have the better on't, and look'd upon the
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> as one that ballanc'd and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpois'd
their inſolent Greatneſs. Upon this
Conſideration, he was heartily troubl'd at our Loſs;
eſpecially when he conſider'd his own private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and the occaſion he had of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Prince,
either to make his Peace with the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court,
or to prevent him from ſubmitting himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to the Tyrannical Yoke of the <hi>Port.</hi> He
turn'd thoſe Thoughts over and over in his diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
Breaſt; and open'd himſelf to Count <hi>Forval</hi>
his Intimate Friend, when he receiv'd Orders to
march with his Army towards <hi>Barcan,</hi> to hem in
that of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cavalry
charg'd them in the Front. 'Tis certain, That if
this <hi>Hungarian</hi> General had done all he could upon
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54820:83"/>
this Occaſion, and diſcharg'd his Truſt to the
<hi>Turks,</hi> he would have ſav'd their Army, and put
a new Face upon their Affairs; for he was above
thirty, ſome ſay, forty thouſand ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>However, he march'd, much againſt his Will,
towards the Champian Country of <hi>Barcan:</hi> and
the <hi>Turks</hi> arriv'd there Friday Night, <hi>October</hi> 8th.
there being but ſix Leagues diſtance between <hi>Buda</hi>
and <hi>Strigonium.</hi> They paſs'd the Bridge all Night,
left 500 Men in the Fort, and poſted themſelves
beyond the Low Plain, on the Brow of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
the very Place where the others had the Day
before charg'd the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Van-Guard. On the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<hi>Octob.</hi> 9th. they drew into a Line of Battle in
the Plains above, ſtretching their Right Wing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Mountains, where is a narrow Valley,
cover'd with Woods and Thickets, through which
<hi>Teckley</hi>'s Army was to paſs: Their Left Wing
terminated very near the Curtain, within ſight
of <hi>Barcan</hi> Fort. They made but one Line, and
one ſingle Front, very thick; but behind, upon
the Brow of the Curtain, there were three Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
of 14 or 15 Squadrons each, plac'd behind
one another, which were to open in the Fight, in
order to ſurround our Army, as they had done at
firſt. This is the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Method of Drawing up
an Army, which may perhaps be of ſome Uſe.
For they pretend that theſe Columns are not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
broke, and rallying themſelves with all the
Eaſe imaginable, their Squadrons thus rank'd, can
the better ſupport the Firſt Line, when 'tis a little
ſhatter'd. They had on the Right Wing, <hi>Kara
Mehemet Pacha, Viſier</hi> of <hi>Buda;</hi> in the Centre, the
<hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Siliſtria;</hi> and next the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Caramania,</hi>
nam'd <hi>Alè,</hi> with three others of the Firſt Rank.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the <hi>Turks</hi> were thus Preparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for a Battle, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> thought of
nothing elſe but Revenging the Diſgrace he had
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54820:84"/>
receiv'd the Day before. He beſtow'd all Friday <hi>Oct.</hi>
8th. in drawing up the two Armies, and in agreeing
upon the Order of Battle in a general Council;
the <hi>Poles</hi> being eager to regain their Credit, and
the <hi>Germans</hi> deſirous to ſhare in the Glory, which
they had in ſome meaſure been rob'd of the Day
before. After this, the King diſpatch'd a Courrier
to <hi>Cracow,</hi> to acquaint the Queen with his ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and with the Reſolution he had taken, either
to make amends for it, or not to ſurvive the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace:
informing her, That he was to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Enemy on the morrow, and that ſhe muſt
expect to hear News either of their Defeat, or of
his Death. Theſe Circumſtances joyn'd to thoſe
of the former Day, wherein his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty was
in ſo much danger, together with the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of what the Palatine of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> had done to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that Prince's Retreat, were a mortal Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Queen, who was in dread of the Life of
her Royal Conſort, and offended that he ſhould be
ſo much oblig'd to the Crown General, with whom
the Court was diſſatisfy'd, ever ſince his open Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with the Marquiſs <hi>De Vitry,</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador. But let us leave the Queen at
the Altar, loading it with her Offerings, and let
us ſee what the King is doing in the Plains of
<hi>Barcan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On Saturday <hi>Octob.</hi> 9. by break of Day he decam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
that he might advance above the Defiles, in
which the Army was poſted, and draw it up in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia
upon that Champian, and even Ground, which
lay Parallel to that which the <hi>Turks</hi> had cover'd with
their Squadrons. As ſoon as we were come upon
the Plain, we diſcover'd their Line ready drawn
up: All our Troops were caſt into three Lines,
there being no occaſion of Stretching them, nor
any conveniency of doing it, becauſe of the Ground
bounded on the Left by the Ridge of Mountains
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54820:84"/>
above-mention'd; and on the Right, by the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
which ran along above the Bottom of <hi>Barcan.</hi>
Our firſt Line had a larger Front than that of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> which did not reach our Centre, at leaſt not
beyond it. In this Line was an equal Number of
<hi>German</hi> and <hi>Poliſh</hi> Troops, the Infantry and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
of both Nations, together with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and Trains of Artillery. Thus were there
ſome of all theſe in each Poſt, and all ſaw the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
hard-by, tho' not many of 'em charg'd them.
The Army was ſtill 50000 ſtrong, and never
made a finer Appearance, not only by the wiſe
Diſpoſition of the Order of Battle, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Ground; but likewiſe by the Diverſity
of the Troops, their Fierce Aſpects, their Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
in keeping their Ranks as they march'd, the
dreadful Sounds of Drums and Trumpets, and
laſtly by the Number of thoſe Famous Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
who led them.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> was poſted on the Right,
to intercept the <hi>Turks,</hi> between the Line and the
Fort of <hi>Barcan,</hi> whoſe Retreat he was minded to
cut off: He aſſign'd the Left Wing to the Grand
General of the Crown, attended with ſome of
the Emperor's Generals, among whom was Count
<hi>Veterani,</hi> who has in the ſubſequent Campaigns
given the World ſuch Signs of an Extraordinary
Valour and Conduct. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> with
others, were in the Centre of the Line of Battle.
The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Artillery was planted in the Spaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Battalions and Squadrons of the Left
Wing, becauſe they very wiſely foreſaw the whole
Force of the <hi>Turks</hi> would fall on that ſide, their
Line being wholly drawn up over againſt them.
No ſooner did the Cannon begin to play, but the
<hi>Turks,</hi> undaunted at the Inequality of their Forces,
charg'd that Wing with an Impetuoſity like Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which cannot be conceiv'd nor deſcrib'd.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54820:85"/>
They were receiv'd by our Troops, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the leaſt Ground, and with a dreadful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of Fire and Ball; it being certain, that by
the firſt Firing of a <hi>German</hi> Battalion, a prodigious
number of Men and Horſes fell to the Ground.
Their Fury was not cool'd by this; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
they return'd with greater Vigour, the Fight
grew warm, and a Bloody Slaughter enſu'd on all
Sides. The <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> did all he could to get
the Better of our Troops, and was wounded in
two or three places by a Sabre. The <hi>Viſier</hi> of
<hi>Siliſtria</hi> advanc'd ſo far, that his Horſe being kill'd
under him, he was ſurrounded by a Body of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,
againſt whom he defended himſelf a long
while, being aſſiſted by 40 of his Domeſticks, who
ſeeing him on the Ground, leap'd all off their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
with their Sabres in their Hands, to cover
their Maſter. This Heroical Action ſtruck our
Generals with Admiration, and they cry'd out,
that they ſhould ſpare thoſe Brave Men, but in
vain, the <hi>Germans</hi> having put themall to the Edge
of the Sword. After this the <hi>Viſier,</hi> abandon'd
to the Fury of the Soldiery, and vanquiſh'd, look'd
about for a General, to whom he might ſurrender
himſelf, chuſing to die, rather than yield to a
leſs Officer. He perceiv'd the Palatine of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi>
and was not out in his Gueſs; for he had the Air
and Figure of what he really was; whereupon the
<hi>Viſier</hi> getting out of the Croud, advanc'd toward
that Lord, to whom he preſented his Sabre. The
<hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Caramania,</hi> was likewiſe wounded and
taken in the ſame place by the Great General's
Troop. However, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtill maintain'd the
Fight, the Succeſs whereof was doubtful. But
thoſe who were drawn up in Columns behind the
Line, perceiving the Motion of our Right Wing,
gueſs'd at the Deſign. They gave notice thereof
to the foremoſt Troops, who retreated gradually,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54820:85"/>
without breaking their Ranks, and at laſt fled
for it.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> foreſaw, That the <hi>Turks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leſs extended than our Line, would uſe their
utmoſt Efforts to break our Left Wing, and after
ſtretch themſelves upon the Flank, between the
two Lines. He therefore ſuffer'd the Fight to
grow a little warm, and in the mean time order'd
the Right Wing to advance from the Centre, in
the form of a Half-Moon, with which he gradually
gain'd the Low Plain, thereby to poſſeſs the whole
compaſs of it, and to get between the Enemies and
their Bridge. He order'd the <hi>Huſſars</hi> to trail
their Lances on the ſide of their Horſe's Necks,
to prevent the Enemy from perceiving the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But they having diſcover'd it, and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturing
truly at the Deſign of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
left the Field of Battle, that they might gain the
Fort of <hi>Barcan,</hi> under the Cannon of the Upper-Town
of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> which carry'd a great way
beyond this, almoſt as far as the Curtain, tho' the
<hi>Danube</hi> be of an extraordinary breadth in this
Place, and the Plain beyond it of a vaſt extent.</p>
                  <p>The Troops were drawn up in Battalia, that
they might march orderly towards the Enemy,
and give the Artillery time to come up with the
Battalions, which open'd a little to the Right and
Left. The <hi>German</hi> Generals complimented his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Majeſty upon this Day's Glorious Succeſs; at
which time one of his Pages, who had with ſome
Squadrons of Volunteers, advanc'd very near the
<hi>Danube,</hi> on the Right ſide of the Fort, return'd
with full ſpeed to acquaint his Majeſty, That the
<hi>Turks</hi> were Filing off over the Bridge. This Prince
animated with the Deſire of compleating his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
order'd his Army to march directly to the
Banks of the River, on both ſides of <hi>Barcan,</hi> and
himſelf at the Head of the foremoſt Squadrons.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54820:86"/>
The Artillery follow'd pretty cloſe, ſome pieces
of which the King order'd to be planted ſo as to
break the Bridge, or graze the top of it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
the Gunners, by the Mony he gave 'em
in Hand, to expedite the Deſign. During theſe
Tranſactions the <hi>Turks</hi> preſs'd forwards to regain
the Fort, and their Number hindering their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
they caſt themſelves into the <hi>Danube,</hi> which
a moment after became all black, and its Stream
cover'd all over with Men, Arms, Horſes, and
Turbants, whoſe heaps and mixture made an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Picture, being both a dreadful and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Sight. Thoſe who would not venture ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a Paſſage, were cut in pieces on the Bank
of the River; and there were heaps of 'em all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
of a Fathom high, which form'd a kind of a
Parapet or Breaſt-work. As an Addition to their
Misfortune, the Bridge was broke by the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of thoſe who fled over it, after 7 or 8 hundred
had paſs'd it with the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Buda.</hi> The reſt,
endeavouring ſtill to gain the Boats, which lay
there, fell by hundreds at a time one upon another,
and were all ſtifl'd by the Weight of thoſe that lay
uppermoſt. But whereas they could not diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
themſelves, nor advance one way or other,
they were expos'd to the Fire of our Artillery and
Troops; yet 'tis certain there were fewer kill'd
that way, than by being ſuffocated.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the <hi>Turks</hi> were thus drown'd, the <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Infantry advanc'd towards the Fort of <hi>Barcan,</hi> the
Regiments of the Queen and Prince of <hi>Poland,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
thither the firſt, and began the Aſſault. The
Count of <hi>Morſtein</hi> being Colonel of the One, and
<hi>Seſſevin</hi> Colonel of the Other, led them directly to
the two Gates, and forc'd them. The Enemy
laid their Arms on the Ground in order to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
themſelves, and hung out a white Flag.
But the <hi>Poles</hi> either did not, or would not ſee it,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54820:86"/>
and fell upon them, without giving them Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
who ſeeing themſelves hopeleſs, betook
themſelves to their Arms again, reſolving to
ſell their Lives at as dear a rate as poſſible. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they made ſo terrible a Diſcharge, that
our Infantry began to give Ground, and were
for regaining the Gates. A <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>Mouilly</hi> by Name, who was Page to the
Marquiſs of <hi>Arquyen,</hi> and Enſign to the Regiment
of the Prince of <hi>Poland,</hi> plac'd himſelf at the Gate
on the Left, by which that Battalion had enter'd,
and with his Sword drove back thoſe who fled
thither, and by this Undauntedneſs much above
one of his Years, he oblig'd them to return upon the
Enemy, of which not a Man was ſav'd. This was the
Finiſhing-ſtroke of that Defeat, the moſt Entire
and Compleat that had been known for a long time
before. Count <hi>Teckley</hi> arriv'd ſoon enough upon
the adjacent Hills, to be an Eye-witneſs of this
Bloody Scene. He did indeed appear upon the
Brow of the Mountains at the cloſe of the Action,
when the <hi>Danube</hi> was cover'd with thoſe unhappy
Creatures, and when the reſt of this Army were
cut in pieces in the Fort; only 7 or 800, having
ſav'd themſelves by paſſing the Bridge with the
<hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi> before it was broke down. The
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> at this time could not expect any rich
Booty, ſince the <hi>Turks</hi> had brought thither neither
Artillery nor Equipages: but to make amends for it,
they did not loſe many Men, nor any Officer of Note;
whereas the Enemy left behind them two <hi>Baſſas</hi>
taken Priſoners, and three others drown'd in the
River, with the Standards of the <hi>Viſiers,</hi> and other
Honourable Tokens of the Victory.</p>
                  <p>After the Taking of the Fort, they reſted a
while on the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> to take a view
of that dreadful Spectacle. Some drew up what
the Current threw aſhore, ſuch as Horſes, Arms,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54820:87"/>
Men, and other Spoils: whilſt the reſt play'd with
the Artillery, that of <hi>Strigonium</hi> not wounding a
Man of our Side. One ſingle ſhot, and perhaps
the laſt either from beyond the River, or from
the Fort of <hi>Barcan,</hi> unfortunately ſtruck between
the two Eyes of a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, belonging to
the Prince of <hi>Poland</hi> nam'd <hi>Duheaume</hi> and forc'd one
of 'em out of his Head. The King endeavour'd
to chear him up, by all the Marks of Eſteem and
Affection, by the Care he order'd to be taken of
him, and by the Preſent he ſent him the next Day
of 100 Ducats in Gold. This Gentleman very
well deſerv'd thoſe diſtinguiſhing Favours; not
only for his conſtant Attendance upon the Prince's
Perſon, but likewiſe for the Preſent he made the
King, in the Fields of <hi>Vienna,</hi> of a Tuft of Heron's
Feathers, garniſh'd with a Roſe of Diamonds and
Rubies, which he found in the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi>'s Tent,
and was the ſame which that <hi>Ottoman</hi> General us'd
to put on the Head of his War-Horſe.</p>
                  <p>The Army return'd upon the Plains above <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
and encamp'd there, by poſſeſſing all the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Bank of the <hi>Danube.</hi> The King with
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> reſov'd to paſs the River in
that Place, and to put an end to the Campaign
by the Taking of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> which would enhance
the Reputation of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, by thus
Marching over the Conqueſts of <hi>Solyman the Great.</hi>
The Emperor's Generals were with much ado
brought over to conſent to it, and the Seaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already very much advanc'd, made the <hi>Poles</hi>
murmur, who began to Breath after their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
but the King threatening to leave them, and
truſt his Perſon with the <hi>German</hi> Troops, each
Soldier return'd to his Duty, and murmured no
more, unleſs in Secret. As for the <hi>Germans,</hi> he
gave them to underſtand, That <hi>Strigonium</hi> could
not hold outlong, and that the <hi>Viſier</hi> could not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54820:87"/>
come to its Relief, after the laſt Defeat. Beſides
he was advertis'd of his Retreat towards <hi>Belgrade,</hi>
leaving <hi>Buda,</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Kara Mehemet Pacha,</hi>
wounded in the Battle, was return'd thither. The
Latter ſtay'd four Days after the Battle in <hi>Strigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
and then went to <hi>Buda</hi> along the <hi>Danube,</hi>
without any Obſtruction, having left two <hi>Baſſas</hi>
in the Place, with a ſtrong Garriſon to maintain
the Siege, in caſe the Victorious Army ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it.</p>
                  <p>It was therefore reſolv'd upon: and all Hands
at Work for building a Bridge in a place where the
River made an Iſland, about half a League above the
City. Beſide the Safety of this Poſt, by the Space
which facilitated the Retreat, from one Bridge to
the other, they rais'd a Fort at the Head of the
Latter, on the Enemy's Side of the River: And
moreover, they had not far from <hi>Javarin</hi> or <hi>Raab,</hi>
where they might cover themſelves, in caſe the
<hi>Turks</hi> ſhould make any deſperate Sally upon them.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt this was doing, and all things neceſſary
for carrying on a Siege were bringing from <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morne;</hi>
General <hi>Dunneval</hi> march'd to ſeiſe upon
<hi>Lewents,</hi> a very conſiderable City, which facilitated
the Communication of the <hi>Turks,</hi> between <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſel</hi>
and <hi>Buda.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> knew
nothing of the Matter; whereupon ſeveral of his
Parties were ſurpriz'd, and fell into the Snare
without dreaming of it. The King order'd <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
to be put into the Hands of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who
burnt the Houſes that were hard-by. At laſt, the
Bridges being finiſh'd by the 19th. of <hi>October,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> order'd part of his Army to paſs
over that Day, and the two next. On the 22d. the
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Infantry, commanded by General <hi>D'Henoff,</hi>
Colonel of the Guards, fil'd off; and the firſt who
paſs'd over, advanc'd towards the Lower City,
who ſent ſeveral Detachments out to diſpute the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54820:88"/>
Paſſes, whilſt the Artillery of the Town play'd
furiouſly on all ſides. The <hi>Turks</hi> at the firſt burnt
the Suburbs within View of us, and afterwards
part of the City it ſelf, on that ſide which lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Open Country.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Preparations for the Siege, the
King, who diſpatch'd a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen, nam'd
<hi>Kaczowsky,</hi> to the Queen juſt after the Battle, to
remove that Trouble and ſollicitude, which his
former Letter had caus'd in her; diſpatch'd me
likewiſe with Anſwers of Importance, and the
whole Army charg'd me with Commiſſions from
them. The <hi>Pole</hi> had been ſent by the Mountains of
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary,</hi> and directed to Count <hi>Teckley,</hi>
who took care he ſhould be convey'd to <hi>Cracow:</hi>
I was order'd to go by the great Road of <hi>Vienna.</hi>
I left the Camp <hi>October</hi> 21ſt after I had, by the
King's Order, viſited the two Fields of Battle, the
Fort of <hi>Barcan,</hi> the Banks of the River along the
Gardens; from whence I took an exact Survey
of <hi>Strigonium</hi> and its Fortreſs, which I obſerv'd
to be wholly built upon a Rock: I afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
on the Right along the <hi>Danube,</hi> towards
the <hi>German</hi> Camp, not being able to go round the
Fort by Water, as I had begun, becauſe the heap
of dead Carcaſſes had choak'd up, and rais'd the
Current: and in all this Round, which Count <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg</hi>
often went in his Coach without regarding
the frequent ſhots of the Enemy; I had no other
Evidence of my Conduct, but an Officer of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
a <hi>German</hi> by Birth, a <hi>Frenchman</hi> by
long Service; for he had been Lieutenant of a
Troop of Horſe in the Regiment of <hi>Bethune,</hi> and
and had run through other Dangers, with an even
Temper, and a Noble Carriage, without any
thing of Vain-glory.</p>
                  <p>At my Return, I found my Diſpatches ready,
and two <hi>Coſacks,</hi> all the Convoy that was allow'd
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54820:88"/>
me, who did not ſo much as know the way of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morne,</hi>
where I was to take Poſt. My Friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
me to travel on the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi>
and to ſtay till the Morrow, when the Emperor's
Envoy would diſpatch his Son-in-Law to <hi>Vienna.</hi>
But the Bridges were crowded, the Imperial Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
buſied in marching the Army over, and my
ſelf eager to arrive at <hi>Cracow,</hi> being ſenſible that
the Queen of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Life depended on my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
or Slowneſs, ſince the firſt Alarms had
brought her, as it were, to Death's door. But my
Zeal had like to have coſt me my Life, I am ſure
it rob'd me of my Liberty. I ſet on my Journey
with the two <hi>Coſacks,</hi> and in the Way joyn'd with
ſome <hi>German</hi> Horſe and Foot, who were going
that Road; ſo that I was at the Head of thirty
Men, when I entred upon the Encampment, which
the Army had made when they left <hi>Komorne.</hi> The
Forragers who return'd from round thoſe Parts,
never ſaid a Word to us of any <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Party, and
I march'd on with ſo little concern, that I took
no Notice at all of a Party that I ſaw juſt before
me, about 500 Paces beyond the old Camp, going
towards <hi>Newhauſel.</hi> It conſiſted of about 150
Horſe, in <hi>Hungarian</hi> Habits, with white Cloaks
on, as all the <hi>Turks</hi> of that Country are habited,
which made me take them for the <hi>Cravatians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Emperor, and induc'd me to ride
towards them a full Trot, that I might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſecur'd by this Convoy. They became ſenſible
of my Miſtake, and ſuffer'd me to come up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thirty Paces of their Rear, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
upon me full drive with their Sabres in
their Hands. Among my thirty Men there were
four <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Foot, who had deſerted
the Regiment of <hi>Roſemberg,</hi> and made ſuch a
vigorous Aſſault, that they laid ſeven <hi>Turks</hi> on
the ground, having charg'd their Muskets with
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54820:89"/>
Hail-ſhot. This brought their whole Party upon
our Men, eighteen of 'em had their Heads cut off,
and the reſt hemm'd in, ſo that none of 'em eſcap'd
to carry the News of the Diſaſter to the Camp. The
inequality of the number made me think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating,
after the Maſſacre of my Fellow-Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and after I had eſcap'd twice or thrice the
ſame Fate, by the Management of my Horſe: For
I had ſeen a Sabre fly over my Head, and had
drop'd my Hat and Perruke in the Skirmiſh. In
ſhort, being minded to fly for it, truſting very
much to the Swiftneſs of my Horſe, which was
of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Breed, and one of the Beſt in
the King's Stables; I was ſtruck on the Forehead
by a Young Cavalier, coming to me with his
Spear in the Reſt, as one running at a Ring, and
by the Blow unhors'd me, which facilitated my
being taken. I knew very well that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to make my eſcape, I only deſir'd to fall
into good Hands, and yield my ſelf to ſome
Officer. Accordingly I march'd directly towards
a <hi>Turk</hi> of a Venerable and Sweet Aſpect, who
happen'd to be the Commander himſelf of that
Party; an Officer of Worth, a ſucceſsful Partiſan,
and a Man of Honor. I ſurrendred my ſelf to him,
who took me by the Hand, and only order'd me
to be diſarm'd: but in marching, ſome of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterns
whip'd me, and took away all my Letters.
Whereas it was now pretty late, it being within
an Hour of Night, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> (for that was the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer's
Name) reſted ſatisfy'd with his Booty, and
return'd towards <hi>Newhauſel.</hi> But in the Way, for
fear of being ſurpris'd in his Retreat, he detach'd
four Cavaliers, as Scouts, to beat the Rounds.</p>
                  <p>In the Evening he rally'd all the Party at the
End of a Ruinous Village, and caus'd them to
march off in a Review, and ſo did the Priſoners
under two Lances held by two Cavaliers in the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54820:89"/>
form of an Arch; from whence he march'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Newhauſel</hi> very eaſily. We forded the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Nitra,</hi> that lay in the Road, and when we
were nigh to the City, the whole Party diſcharg'd
their Piſtols in the Air, an Eſtabliſh'd Cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Turks,</hi> when they return with Priſoners.
We were order'd to ſtay half an Hour at the City
Gate, into which we did not enter before ten at
Night: the Party diſpers'd themſelves in the firſt
Street they came to: One of the Officers brought
me into a Houſe, where I left my Horſe, and was
laſh'd a ſecond time, being ſtill in my Boots. He
order'd me to be carry'd before a certain Perſon
of Quality, whom I look'd upon to be the Second
<hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Place, and who would not vouchſafe to
ſpeak a Word to me; but order'd me to go into
his Footmen's Room. One of e'm, who was
a Young Renegadoe <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and had formerly
been a Student at <hi>Tyrnau,</hi> came by his Maſter's
command to examine me, and give me a third
laſhing. He was more lucky than thoſe who came
before, for he found thirty Ducats of Gold that
I had ſav'd. The joy that he ſhew'd upon the
Diſcovery of theſe Pieces, is inexpreſſible; he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
them forthwith to his Maſter, lying then
upon his <hi>Sopha,</hi> regaling himſelf with his Pipe and
Coffee. After he done examining me, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
me back again to the ſame Officer's Houſe,
where I firſt alighted. A Young Cavalier, being
one of the Party, and Valet to the Officer, gave
me ſome Coleworts and Meat to eat, being what
was left of his Supper, afterwards he brought me
into his Maſter's Chamber, to ly near him upon
the ſame Floor, where you may ſuppoſe I got but
very little Sleep. On the Morrow, betimes in
the Morning, I was carry'd into the Stable, to
rub down and dreſs my Horſe: but perceiving
that I was very awkard in managing the Curry-comb,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54820:90"/>
he very civilly diſcharg'd me from that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
Afterwards I was brought to another Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer's
Houſe, being a Man of Note, where I found
all my Comrades, that had been taken with me
the Day before, with the Heads of thoſe that had
been kill'd, fix'd at the end of a Pole, and carry'd
each by one of the Cavaliers. This was a dread
ful Sight, and the only Inſtance of Cruelty to be
obſerv'd in all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cuſtoms; for they are
a Nation endu'd with a great deal of Humanity,
and Charity, having a Sweetneſs of Temper tho'
unpoliſh'd, and a Bravery, without any thing of
Fierceneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus were we led on in Triumph to the Prime
<hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Houſe, where was the Leader of the Party
to preſent to him the Priſoners, with a great many
other <hi>Turks</hi> of Note, Officers, Lawyers, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Divan,</hi> or Council. At the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
we put off our Shoes, as the <hi>Turks</hi> did
theirs, becauſe the Chamber-floor was cover'd all
over with a Carpet. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was upon his
Couch, rais'd upon oblong Cuſhions in an Angle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Windows: and the Couch being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with another Carpet of Red Cloth, edg'd
about with a Green Silk Fringe, was rais'd half a
Foot all round the Walls, and quilted; which
ſerv'd him inſtead of a Bed, without a Canopy and
Curtains; a Sabre, and a Horſe-Tayl, dy'd in
Red, hanging at the Top. The Strangers were
ſeated below the Rails, and the Officer with the
Domeſticks, ſtanding round the Chamber, with
their two Hands upon their Breaſts, which is a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of Reſpect among the <hi>Turks.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> a
Perſon very old and Meagre, but withal of a pretty
venerable Aſpect, caus'd a <hi>German</hi> to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
and afterwards my ſelf, in <hi>Latin,</hi> by that
Young Renegade <hi>Hungarian</hi> above-mention'd,
threatning to cut off both our Heads, if we did
not give a Punctual Anſwer. After this, they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54820:90"/>
broke open my Letters, and made me find out
that Particular one ſent from the King to the
Queen of <hi>Poland,</hi> which was likewiſe interpreted
by a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Renegade. During this, the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
made me ſit down on the Ground, and treated me
very Nobly with a Diſh of Coffee. He made
choice of me, and another <hi>French</hi> Priſoner, for his
Share, and ſent us to his Eldeſt Son, and his <hi>Kiayia,</hi>
or Lieutenant lodg'd in another Brick-Houſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as Stately as the Biſhop's Palace, in which the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> his Father reſided. This <hi>Kiayia</hi> did not ſeem
to be over inquiſitive about us. After a ſhort Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
he ſent us into a Room, where ten or
twelve of his Servants were eating. There we
ſtay'd all Day till Night came, and then were
ſhut up in a Vault, faſten'd together by one Foot,
or rather in certain Wooden-holds, made like a
Pair of Stocks. The bare Ground was our Bed,
without Hay or Straw, or Coverlet. In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the ſame Keeper came to releaſe us, and ſhew
us up Stairs, where we eat ſome pieces of Bread,
and what Scraps thoſe <hi>Turks</hi> were pleas'd to leave
us upon their Plates. A charitable <hi>Dervis,</hi> or Monk,
dwelling in this Family, and very much reſpected
by all the Reſt, refreſh'd me after Dinner, with an
Earthen Pan of Coals; which was no ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to me in my Miſery, my Cloaths being very
thin, having loſt my Cloak, my Peruke and my
Hat; one being taken from me by a Cavalier of
the Party, and the others left on the Field of
Battle: ſo that I ſpent all the next Winter (which
was very ſtarp in thoſe Parts) bare-headed, having
only a ſorry Muſlin Cravat wrapp'd about it, as
long as it laſted. I profeſs ſolemnly, that I was in
a very deplorable Condition; and that nothing
can be a greater Affliction, to a Man of Honour,
than Slavery, not ſo much by the Sufferings he
feels in his Body, as by the Affronts that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54820:91"/>
to his Spirit; from my own Experience, I
can here teſtify the truth of what I always look'd
upon as a Popular Tradition, like a thouſand
others, which the ignorant Vulgar attribute to
the <hi>Turks;</hi> Who, ſay they, look into the Hands
of their Slaves, thereby to diſcover their Quality
or Employment, by the Fineneſs of their Skin.
This, I ſay, is very true; for all that ever came
nigh me, the firſt thing they did was to look into
my Hands. As for the reſt, I was pretty eaſie in
the Houſe of this <hi>Kiayia,</hi> who exacted no manner
of Labour, or Service from me.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> order'd the King's
Letter to the Queen, to be turn'd out of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language; and ſent it with all
the reſt to the Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> ſuppos'd ſtill to be at
<hi>Buda,</hi> by an Officer and twenty Horſe; who
march'd directly to <hi>Lewents,</hi> and were taken by
the <hi>Germans,</hi> whom they did not imagine were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of that Place. The <hi>Germans</hi> ſent all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they found about the <hi>Turks,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
who likewiſe ſent them to the King, being
all writ in <hi>Poliſh.</hi> The King was ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to ſee his Letter return'd, and ſuppoſing
that I was either kill'd or taken, he order'd En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
to be made about it of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officer,
who own'd the Truth, and ſaid that I was at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſel,</hi>
as well as he was at <hi>Lewents.</hi> Upon this, his
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty very generouſly ſet himſelf upon my
Deliverance, and ſent the Interpreter of the Grand
General, under a Pretence of ranſoming ſeveral
<hi>Touariches</hi> and Officers of his Regiments; but in
reality to treat about my Exchange, which he was
willing to do nicely, leſt the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſhould prove
ſtiff, in caſe he had occaſion to ſuſpect that I was
a Perſon of Note. He had already ſurmis'd ſome
ſuch thing, from that Honourable Mention which
ſo great a King had made of a Domeſtick in his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54820:91"/>
Letter. For the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are us'd to <hi>Thou</hi> all
the World, even their Emperor himſelf, and who
had conceiv'd a great Eſteem for the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by his laſt Victory, could not imagine that
the Perſon whom he diſtinguiſh'd by the Name of
<hi>Monſieur,</hi> and of whom he ſaid ſo many favourable
Things, could be no more than a Gentleman
of the Queen's Houſhold. They abſolutely
thought me to be her Brother, not knowing
that it was the <hi>French</hi> Mode of Speaking. They
were confirm'd in this fooliſh Opinion, by the
Money and Jewels which I had about me, and by
the Rich Cloaths I had on. It was in vain for
me to explain to them the Expences of the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and the Length of the Way to <hi>Cracow,</hi> to let
them underſtand, That all that Money was no
more than neceſſary for it. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who are
unacquainted with thoſe Matters, never troubled
themſelves with theſe Conſiderations, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
me to be at leaſt ſome Lord of Quality. They
were farther confirm'd in this Opinion, by the
fooliſh Behaviour of one of thoſe <hi>Poles</hi> that were
taken with me, who being releas'd at ten Days
end, came and embrac'd me by the Knees, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Cuſtom, and thank'd me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that the King would never have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
him, but becauſe he was one of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Upon this Demonſtration of Reſpect, the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> order'd him to be examin'd concerning my
Quality; and this wretched Creature, thinking to
recommend me by raiſing me above the Rank of
an Ordinary Perſon, expatiated upon the great
Eſteem which the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had for me, and
upon that high Poſt which I held in his Court,
which the <hi>Baſſa</hi> took for granted, and it coſt me
fourteen Months Slavery, as I ſhall hereafter
ſhew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:54820:92"/>
During this Negotiation, the King of <hi>Poland</hi>
carried on the Siege of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> which at firſt
ſeem'd reſolv'd to ſtand it out. The Elector of
<hi>Bavaria</hi> was made acquainted with this Deſign;
who order'd part of his Troops to march on that
ſide, and led them himſelf. Upon my Return from
<hi>Cracow,</hi> I found him encamp'd in the middle of
<hi>Presbourg;</hi> and his Troops a quarter of a League
beyond the Town, from whence they enter'd the
Iſle of <hi>Schut</hi> over the Bridge that had been rais'd in
that place. But the Elector never came up to the
Army, who carried <hi>Strigonium</hi> in two or three
Days, and afterwards diſpers'd themſelves into
Winter Quarters; the <hi>Imperialists</hi> in the Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Countries, and the <hi>Poles</hi> in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary,</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
by the Rebels, whom they were oblig'd to
force thence.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Poland,</hi> having order'd the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Army, and part of his Infantry to paſs the
Bridges, caus'd General <hi>Staremberg</hi> to carry on the
Aſſault, and remain'd with half of his Forces in
the Old Camp, on this ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> being
willing by this means to ſhare the Glory of the
Concluſion of this Campaign, between the <hi>Poles</hi>
and the <hi>Imperialists.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Germans</hi> open'd
their Trenches, and rais'd their Batteries againſt
the Upper-Town, that being all that was left,
for the Lower-Town had been burn, and the <hi>Turks</hi>
all retreated into the Fortreſs. The Aſſault was
carry'd on vigorouſly; they likewiſe batter'd
down the Fortifications and the Wall, to facilitate
the Scaling of the Town. In the mean time
they were for coming cloſer to it, and to ſpring
a Mine: for which purpoſe, they carried the
Palliſade within a foot of the Walls, with their
Swords in their Hands. And whilſt they were
looking for a place to make a hole in, for 'twas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all Rocky, the Town Beat a Parley, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54820:92"/>
to Capitulate. The <hi>Germans</hi> who were for
taking the Garriſon at Diſcretion, refus'd at firſt
the Propoſal of the <hi>Baſſas;</hi> but being oblig'd to
acquaint the King of <hi>Poland</hi> with it, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Army with the ſame Power as the
Emperor himſelf would have done; this Monarch
accepted of the Capitulation, and the <hi>Baſſas</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd
the Place into his Hands; out of which
they march'd Sunday <hi>Octob.</hi> 24. The King would
have perſwaded them to have retir'd into <hi>Poland,</hi>
for fear the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi> ſhould revenge the Loſs
of <hi>Strigonium</hi> upon them: but they, unhappy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures!
more ſubject than Slaves, perſiſted in their
Reſolution of going to <hi>Buda,</hi> giving out that they
had done their Duty, ſince they wanted Supplies,
in holding out the Place for 3 Days, againſt a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
and Victorious Army. But the Plea ſtood
'em in no ſtead, for upon their Arrival, they loſt
their Lives, by being beheaded or ſtrangled.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the King of <hi>Poland</hi> croſs'd the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to take a View of the Place, glorying in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forc'd the <hi>Turks</hi> to abandon it, after they
had been Poſſeſſors of it for 143 Years, being ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
there by their Emperor <hi>Solyman the Great.</hi> He
put the City into the Hands of the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
who left a Governor, with a very ſtrong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
in it. At laſt all the Army repaſs'd to the
Old Camp, from whence they broke up on <hi>All-Saints</hi>
Day; on which the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Body of <hi>Imperial</hi> Troops, commanded
by General <hi>Dunneval,</hi> march'd by that Neck of
Mountains, which lie on the Left of the Plains of
<hi>Barcan,</hi> to enter into <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-Hungary;</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
that Day upon a River three Leagues
beyond. The <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of
<hi>Caramania,</hi> the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Great General's Priſoners,
were conducted along with the Army, and treated
very Honourably by that Lord, to whom the King
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54820:93"/>
had granted them as his Prize. Tho' ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths-men
grumbled, and ſaid, They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the Republick. The Great General
had at firſt ſent them to his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Sovereign, and the <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
and afterwards brought them to <hi>Leopold,</hi>
lodg'd them in a Neat Houſe, and allow'd them as
much Liberty as they could reaſonably deſire; with
Servants of their own that they ſent for from <hi>Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niec,</hi>
whom this Lord entertain'd to the number of
ſeven or eight, which my ſelf ſaw. He clothed them
in Velvet, treated them magnificently according
to their Cuſtom, and order'd the Merchants of the
City to ſupply them with whatever they wanted:
and, I am ſure, that 'bating their Slavery, thoſe
<hi>Turks</hi> far'd as well as if they had been in their own
Country. Tho' they had promis'd 150000 Crowns
each for their Ranſom, and the Money came not
in 7 Years after their being taken, yet the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſpar'd nothing of his Civility, or Expences up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, which amounted every Year to 12000
Franks of that Sum. 'Tis true, they could not be
blam'd for any Delay in this Matter; ſince their
Ranſom was once brought as far as <hi>Caminiec:</hi> but
the <hi>Sultan</hi> was ſo far from contributing any thing
towards it, that even the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of that Place ſeis'd
upon the Money, and made uſe of it to pay off
his Garriſon, who were ready to mutiny for want
of their Pay. They wrote often to the <hi>Port,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
the Money might be re-imburs'd, but they
were ſo far from having Juſtice done them, that
on the contrary, their Offices were afterwards
diſpos'd of to others, and their Perſons proſcrib'd,
tho' they were men of great Note, and an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Merit. The <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> had a Noble
and Charming Aſpect, a comely Shape, a grave
Air, Eyes full of Sweetneſs, a venerable Beard, a
Face full of Majeſty and <hi>Decorum,</hi> with very fine
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54820:93"/>
Features. His Carriage was Charming, Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and Courteous, but ſomewhat Stately, and
as of one far above the inferiour Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
His outward Form was perfectly agreeable
to the Poſt he was in, and to his Perſonal Merit.
In the Battle he gave Signs of an extraordinary
Valour; and when he was taken, he ſhew'd a great
deal of Conſtancy and preſence of Mind, being ſo
far from concealing his Quality of <hi>Viſier,</hi> that
he deſir'd to be us'd as a Priſoner of that Rank,
and to be diſtinguiſh'd from his Comrade, who was
no more than a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> with whom he would not ſo
much as be Quartered. General <hi>Dunneval</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him after the Battle, and repreſenting
to him the Raſhneſs of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Men, dar'd to engage an Army of 50000
ſtrong: This <hi>Viſier</hi> very coldly reply'd, That he
had follow'd his Orders without reflecting upon
the Inequality, and would have charg'd the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
tho' they had been twice as ſtrong again.
His Misfortune afflicted, without ſinking his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and he bore it with an Heroical Conſtancy, and
never appear'd out of Humour, but on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Great General, whoſe Civilities he
could never repay or retaliate.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Caramania Alé,</hi> is one of a different
Character: In all his Behaviour he ſhew'd a great
deal of Fire, Life, and Subtilty. He was of a
leſs Stature, had a meagre Countenance, a black
and rough Beard, ſparkling Eyes, and a <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Air; Fierce without Majeſty, Lofty without the
attendance of that Politeneſs, and Sweetneſs to be
obſerv'd in the other: But yet Noble and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
in his Carriage, crafty and ſubtle in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
asking Queſtions of his own accord, and
with a preſence of Mind. When the Court was
at <hi>Leopold,</hi> two Years after their Arrival, they
all flock'd out of Curioſity to ſee them; the Queen
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54820:94"/>
was there her ſelf mask'd, attended with other
Ladies, that ſhe might not be known; the Marquis of
<hi>Arquyen</hi> her Father, and other Lords. They would
not ſo much as caſt their Eyes off their Books, or
open their Lips to ſome; but to others they paid
their Complements, but eſpecially to the Ladies,
but with a kind of penetrating Diſtinction, as if
they were inform'd of the Difference of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages.
The <hi>Viſier</hi> ſeem'd to be between 55
and 60 Years old, and was already turn'd grey;
the other about ten or twelve Years younger. In
my Mind, both of 'em in their proper Poſts, might be
compar'd to the moſt Illuſtrious Perſonages of the
Age, as well for the Neatneſs and Nobleneſs of
their Make, as for their Behaviour and Bravery.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> led the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army
through the Plains of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> where he made
a Halt for two Days in the Neighbourhood of
that Place, which he thought to have taken by
Surprize, or at leaſt to ſcare it by the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
which had put an End to this Campaign; but
he was receiv'd with terrible Diſcharges of Canon:
The <hi>Turks</hi> likewiſe fell upon his Rear, and brought
back a great many Stragglers, and Men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the Carriages into the Town, moſt of
them being wounded: I was then in the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s
Houſe, who had taken me from his Son's, and put
me under the guard of his Porter, a pretty civil
and courteous Man; who lodg'd me in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
allow'd me a good Bed, and gave me twice a
Day Proviſions, more than I could eat. The
<hi>Chaous</hi> who came to fetch me from the <hi>Kiayia</hi>'s
Houſe, brought me at firſt to this Porter, waiting
for the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Orders, which were that I ſhould
be loaded with Chains. This was a cruel Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the ſeverity of my Slavery. I return'd
from the Mareſhal's acroſs the whole Town of
<hi>Newhauſel,</hi> ſtumbling at every ſtep I took, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54820:94"/>
in my Mind; eſpecially when I ſaw ſeveral
charitable <hi>Turks</hi> offer me Alms, and threaten me
becauſe I refus'd it. For you muſt take notice,
That they freely give it to Slaves, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Civility of <hi>Thank You, Sir,</hi> and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the Haughtineſs of a Refuſal. In proceſs of
Time my Pride was abated, being ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing,
that I was reduc'd to the Neceſſity of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
an Alms of them; and brought to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
Condition that my bad Stars had never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
me for before.</p>
                  <p>I did not wear thoſe Shackles long; for the <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ayia</hi>
making a Viſit to his Father three Days after,
ſeem'd to be very much offended at this rough
Uſage, and by his own Authority order'd my Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be knock'd off. The Porter had afterwards
Orders from the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to clap me into ſmall Chains,
which open'd with Padlocks, only during Night,
and to releaſe me every Morning: but by way of
Exchange, he made me ſweep the Stairs, and the
Paſſage between the Gates, which was his Buſineſs
and my Task.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the Interpreter of
the Great General arriv'd, with the Money which
the King had ſent to bring me to the Army; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
my Exchange would have been made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Demur. The Interpreter manag'd the
Buſineſs very ſubtilly. He firſt demanded the
<hi>Touariches</hi> and Officers in his Maſter's Name; and
after he had agree'd with the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to give as many
<hi>Turks,</hi> Head for Head, he ask'd him what other
Priſoners he had taken during this Campaign. The
<hi>Baſſa</hi> anſwer'd, That he had a <hi>Frenchman</hi> taken
with Letters, and forthwith order'd me to come
into his Chamber. The Interpreter making as if he
did not know me, examin'd me of my Quality, and
how I happen'd to fall into this Misfortune; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
offer'd a <hi>Turk</hi> in Exchange for me, which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54820:95"/>
was agree'd upon. A Chartel was accordingly
drawn up, wherein were ſet down all thoſe whom
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was to ſend back to the Great General
of <hi>Poland,</hi> and thoſe that were to be return'd by
way of Exchange. A Captain with twenty Horſe
went to the Camp, with the Convoy, that had
attended the Interpreter to <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> to bring
back the <hi>Turks</hi> that were agree'd upon, and the
Interpreter ſtaid with us as Hoſtage. In the mean
Time, I was order'd to go into all the Houſes of
the Town, to make choice of the Perſons who had
been taken with me, and it was then that One of
thoſe unhappy Creatures, out of a Tranſport of
Joy and Gratitude, embrac'd my Knees, and ruin'd
me by his Over-civility.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the King of <hi>Poland</hi> was then upon his
March, the <hi>Turks</hi> were a long time upon the
Road; and did not bring back all the Priſoners nam'd
in the Chartel of Exchange; becauſe three of them,
during theſe Tranſactions, had made their Eſcape
from the Camp, and were come to <hi>Newhauſel.</hi>
But in their ſtead, the King had ſent three others,
which the <hi>Baſſa</hi> never minding, and beſides being
pre-poſſeſs'd on my Account, more than was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
upon the Demonſtration of Reſpect ſhewn
me by the Indiſcreet <hi>Pole;</hi> he laid hold on this
pretence to detain me with two other Officers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Palatin of <hi>Ruſſia</hi>'s Regiment of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
and ſeveral <hi>Huſſars,</hi> in whoſe ſtead he
ſent other <hi>Polanders,</hi> to balance the number. As
an Addition to my Misfortune, he commanded me
to ſend the King Word, That if he did not ſend
10000 Ducats of Gold for my Ranſom, I ſhould
have 200 Blows on the bottoms of my Feet; as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomirsky</hi>
had done to the <hi>Baſſa Ibraham,</hi> who was
taken at the Siege of <hi>Vienna.</hi> This <hi>Ibraham</hi> appear'd
very unluckily for me, and confirm'd the thing;
being ſtill in Chains, and come thither by leave of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54820:95"/>
the Governor of <hi>Komorne</hi> to negotiate for his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom;
which the <hi>Baſſa</hi> propos'd likewiſe in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for mine.</p>
                  <p>I wrote what he deſir'd, but without any hopes
of being heard; and the Interpreter ſtay'd ſtill at
<hi>Newhauſel,</hi> to make an end of the Buſineſs: But
the Replies from the Camp were ſo unſatisfactory,
that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> kept his Word with me; and the
Interpreter himſelf very narrowly eſcap'd the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinado.
The great Squire of the Crown wrote
to me of the Injuſtice, and my Friends, to whom
I had ſent for Linnen and Cloaths, fearing that
their Kindneſs would retard my Deliverance, left
me witout a ſupply, and out of Love, refus'd to
ſend me ſo much as a Shirt. The Great Squire
wrote likewiſe to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> telling him, That his
falſifying his Word, ſo uncommon among the
<hi>Turks,</hi> would fall heavy upon the two Priſoners
of the Great General, whoſe Legs, Arms, and
Necks, they would load with Irons; but he never
concern'd himſelf about them: and ſending back
the Interpreter with the Number agree'd upon,
kept me ſtill in Slavery and Miſery.</p>

               <p>AFTER the Taking of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as aforeſaid, ſeparated; and the

Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> at the ſame time, gain'd the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
in order to re-inforce the Garriſons of his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54820:96"/>

unavoidable, ſince the <hi>Germans</hi> were within ſix
Leagues of it, had no River to paſs, nor any Fort
of Conſequence to diſpute by the way thither.
(For the next Year, when the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> laid
Siege to this Important Place, he open'd the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
by taking of <hi>Veyſſegrad</hi> and <hi>Veiſſembourg,</hi>
two Forts beyond <hi>Strigonium,</hi> in the Country that
lies round <hi>Buda.</hi>) Afterwards the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi>
march'd for <hi>Belgrade,</hi> to preſent his Head to the
<hi>Sultan,</hi> who tho' he was his Father-in-Law, yet
would not Pardon him this his Second Defeat.
His Death-Warrant was brought to his Houſe, and
the Officers, in preſenting it to him, clapp'd a ſilk
cord about his Neck, with which he was ſtrangl'd,
after he had kiſs'd the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Warrant, and the
fatal Inſtrument of his Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> took his March towards
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary,</hi> leaving the River <hi>Theyſſe</hi> on the
Right, which ſeparates the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> from the
<hi>Turkiſh Hungary,</hi> and even the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Part of that
Country was at that time in Rebellion. As he
went along, he attack'd the Places which lay in
his way; the firſt was <hi>Zetzen,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi>
call <hi>Setchan,</hi> ſcituated on a ſmall Riſing in the midſt
of uneven Plains, which began by little and little,
to riſe into Hills, and then into Mountains, till
they made that Chain of Hills, with which <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi>
is ſurrounded, and ſeparated from the States
of <hi>Poland. Zetzen</hi> is a ſmall Town, enclos'd within
Walls, and a deep Trench, but narrow at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and eaſie to be paſs'd over. The Gate had
a Retrenchment of Palliſades, made of large pieces
of Timber, in the nature of a Ravelin, and Guards
within, ſome pieces of Cannon on the Walls, with
a Garriſon of about Six hundred Men, Horſe and
Foot, commanded by an <hi>Aga</hi> or Captain, call'd by
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54820:96"/>
the <hi>Turks Tchorbaggey, i. e.</hi> An Officer of Foot of
great Note.</p>
               <p>The Army appear'd before this Place, <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
10. 1683, and the King took a View of it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to attack it the next Day. They ſaw a place
in the Walls, which had a Breach made up with
Palliſades: There, and at the Gate, the Dragoons
and the Infantry, carry'd on the Aſſault with
Sword in Hand: The General <hi>d' Henoff</hi> attack'd
the Gate, where the Prince's Regiment forc'd the
Palliſade very vigorouſly, in ſpite of a whole ſhower
of Musket-ſhot, with which ſeveral Officers and
Soldiers were kill'd or wounded. Afterwards
they ſeis'd upon the Body of the Guards, that were
lodg'd in the Palliſade, and were juſt upon breaking
open the Gate, when the <hi>Aga</hi> hung out a White
Flag, and deſir'd to be gone. This was granted
him, and the Garriſon march'd out without Arms,
and without their Bag and Baggage. However,
the Capitulation was not duly kept, by an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that had nothing to do with the Taking of
this Town. For the King was ordering the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
to march out, when his Envoy return'd from
<hi>Newhauſel,</hi> with News of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s falſifying his
Word with reſpect to me. This rais'd a Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in that great Monarch's Breaſt, and oblig'd
him to make a Repriſal on the <hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Zetzen,</hi> of
whom he mark'd out 30 with his Cane, as they
went out of the City; beginning with the <hi>Aga,</hi> his
Son, the Prieſt, and others of greateſt Note, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that Garriſon, telling them, That he
detain'd them as Priſoners, not to forfeit the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
given them, but to revenge the Treachery of
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> who detain'd a Servant
from him, contrary to the Chartel of Exchange.
He added, That two of them might go to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
for their own Liberty, by obtaining that of
the other; and that, in the mean time, the other
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54820:97"/>
28 ſhould be kept in Chains. The <hi>Aga</hi>'s Son, and
a <hi>Janizary</hi> were deputed for this Negotiation,
which came to nothing. On the contrary, the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> offended that they had deliver'd up the Town,
ſent them away with Threats, upbraiding their
Cowardiſe, and faint Reſiſtance, which the <hi>Sultan</hi>
would be ſure to puniſh with Death, if ever they
ſhould return into his Dominions: That therefore
they were ſafer in their Slavery, and might tarry
with the <hi>Poles,</hi> or free themſelves by other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes:
That the <hi>Frenchman</hi> was his Slave, for
whom he would have Money, not Men. So that
theſe two <hi>Muſſulmen</hi> were ſurpriz'd to ſee a <hi>Baſſa</hi>
prefer his own ſordid Intereſt, before the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Blood, and vex'd that they could do no good for
their Comrades, made uſe of that Liberty they had,
retiring to <hi>Buda,</hi> and leaving the reſt in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of <hi>Tranſchyn,</hi> a City of <hi>Hungary,</hi> upon the
<hi>Wag,</hi> towards the Frontiers of <hi>Moravia,</hi> whither
the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had ſent them; and where for 14
Months, they ſuffer'd all the Miſery imaginable, as I
did at <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> being abandon'd to a wild Deſpair.</p>
               <p>I had ſaid before, That the Dragoons together
with the Infantry, were commanded to carry on
the Aſſault of <hi>Zetzen.</hi> The Count of <hi>Maligny,</hi>
the Queen of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Brother, who was General,
and Colonel in particular of the King's Regiment
of Dragoons, advanc'd as far as the Palliſſade, to
animate his Troops, by his Preſence and Example:
which was of great uſe for the carrying on the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
with Succeſs; for his Dragoons were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Leader, their Lieutenant Colonel Nam'd
<hi>Galetski</hi> being found by the Count, hid behind one
of the great pieces of Timber of the Palliſade, with
his Piſtol in his Hand, where he had no need to
fear the Firing from the Walls. I was willing to
mention this, to give the World an Idea of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Officers, who moſt of 'em deſire
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54820:97"/>
to die calmly in their Beds; whereas even Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Generals, and Mareſhals of <hi>France</hi> are for
falling in the Field of Honour, and at the Head of
their Troops.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Zetzen</hi> being thus ſurrender'd was
guarded at firſt by the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Infantry, and the
Head-Captain of the Prince's Regiment, Nam'd
<hi>Des Forges,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and a Gentleman belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Queen, was plac'd in it as Commander
in Chief. The King gave the Inhabitants leave
to go out with their Families: A great many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Children follow'd the Soldiery, after
which the King put the place into the Hands of
General <hi>Dunneval,</hi> who took poſſeſſion of it for
the Emperor, and made a ſtand there with his
Detachment, from whence he ſent them into Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Quarters. His <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty continu'd his
March, after he had ſpent four Days about <hi>Zetzen,</hi>
and advanc'd towards <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> one of the Chief and
Strongeſt Cities of the Kingdom; fortify'd former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a Citadel, which Count <hi>Teckley</hi> had won the
Year before, and demoliſh'd, as he did the Fort
of <hi>Fileck.</hi> The Emperor had aſſign'd thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
Cities for Winter Quarters to the <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Army, which they muſt firſt be oblig'd to force,
tho' they were well garriſon'd: ſo that there was
no ſtaying in an Enemy's Country with ſuch a
Handful of Men, being continually harraſs'd with
<hi>Hungarian</hi> Parties, and the Peaſants, who cut off
ſeveral of our Army. The Soldiery dead almoſt
with Hunger and Cold, oblig'd to paſs Rivers half
froz'n over, and often ſwell'd above their Banks,
went to dry themſelves in the adjacent Villages,
ſought for ſome ſhelter on every ſide, and were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Rebels, who deſtroy'd more of our Army
that way, than they had by the Battles of <hi>Vienna</hi>
and <hi>Barcan.</hi> Nay, they were oblig'd to Count
<hi>Teckley,</hi> for that ſmall number which did at laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54820:98"/>
in <hi>Poland:</hi> For he being always the King's
truſty Friend, and keeping the Engagements made
between them, advis'd him to draw off betimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not able any longer to prevent the Cutting off
of his Paſſage through the Mountains: after which
the Rebels would quickly make an hand of his
Army. The <hi>Turks</hi> were in ſuch Expectations of
it, that News was brought to <hi>Newhauſel</hi> of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Defeat of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Troops; which infallibly
would have been, had <hi>Teckley</hi> preferr'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of his Party, before the Obligations he had
with the King, to whom his Majeſty ſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
for all the Glorious Succeſſes of this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
The <hi>Turks</hi> had ſo certain an Intelligence
of this, that ſometimes after they caus'd this Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader
of the Rebels to be arreſted, as we ſhall ſhew
in its proper place.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> would not venture too nigh
<hi>Caſſovia,</hi> but encamp'd on one ſide out of the reach
of the Cannon. The Town fir'd briskly upon our
Troops, as they march'd along within ſight of the
Place, and the Garriſon ſally'd out upon the Strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers.
So that ſtaying there only one Night, they
the next Day paſs'd the River above <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> and
ſo to continue their March to <hi>Eperies,</hi> another Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City of <hi>Hungary,</hi> larger and of greater Trade
than the former, but not ſo highly Dignify'd, ſeated
at the Foot of the Mountains of <hi>Crapak,</hi> upon one
of the Rivers that run to <hi>Caſſovia.</hi> For this City
is ſcituate in the very Centre where two large Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets
joyn together, which in going through the
City, make but one ſingle River, and thus through
the ſame Channel, diſembogue themſelves into
the <hi>Theyſſe</hi> below <hi>Tokay.</hi> Theſe two Rivulets
ſpring from thoſe very Mountains, and form a kind
of <hi>Peninſula,</hi> reaching from the Foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> being a handſome Tract of Ground.
<hi>Eperies</hi> is upon that River which is on the Right:
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54820:98"/>
The King approach'd it, in order to beſiege it,
ſo that the Cannon play'd into his Camp, even
beyond the Tents of his Head-Quarters. Upon
His Arrival, the Garriſon ſally'd out upon our
foremoſt Squadrons, and skirmiſh'd with them
all that Day. On the Morrow they fell upon the
King's Dragoons at Mid-day, who quickly moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Horſes, and repuls'd the Sallyers. On
the third Day the King broke up from thence, to
ſeek out Winter-Quarters elſewhere. Inſtead of
<hi>Eperies</hi> which had been aſſign'd for his <hi>Huſſars,</hi> and
his own Regiments, He led the Army directly to
<hi>Czebin,</hi> three Leagues beyond in the Mountains,
where he arriv'd the Second Day after he had left
<hi>Eperies.</hi> From the Camp that lay betwixt, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
<hi>Miogenski</hi> with his Brigade to go and take
a View of <hi>Czebin,</hi> and the adjacent Places. The
Horſe of the Town ſally'd out upon his Troops;
<hi>Miogenski</hi> retreated into ſeveral Houſes and Barns,
which the Diſpoſition of the Ground had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd,
where he form'd an Ambuſcade. Thirty
of his Cavalry being detach'd, advanc'd further up
in the Plain, in order to draw out the Garriſon,
who fell into the Snare, and very vigorouſly purſu'd
our Men to the Place where they had Orders to face
about; but the reſt of the Brigade coming up,
they began a regular Fight, which ended in the
Retreat of the Rebels, who left behind them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſlain, and ſeveral Priſoners. <hi>Miogenski</hi> had a
Horſe kill'd under him, and his Nephew took an
<hi>Hungarian</hi> Officer. After this, the King appear'd
before the Place, where the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Army firſt
joyn'd him. It came to <hi>Cracow</hi> the latter end of
<hi>September,</hi> and for two Months together, kept skirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Frontiers, or in the Entrance into <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
leaving every where behind them tokens of
their March, in the open Countries and againſt
the Peaſants. This very much offended Count
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54820:99"/>
                  <hi>Teckley,</hi> and the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Court, who had order'd the
<hi>Lithuanian</hi> Generals to prevent any Diſturbance,
or Acts of Hoſtility from being offer'd to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of that Prince. Theſe Generals began to
Cannonade <hi>Czebin,</hi> when the King arriv'd before
it, and the Town which held out againſt the Army
of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> ſurrender'd upon Articles to his
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty. He ſpake very civilly to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
exhorting them to return to the Obedience
of the Emperor their lawful Sovereign. But they
very freely told him, That they had rather die,
than ſubmit to the <hi>German</hi> Yoke: begging Leave
that they might follow him, and ſerve in his Army.
Accordingly they did attend his Majeſty for ſome
Days, but after he was advanc'd a little in his
March, they return'd back to <hi>Czebin,</hi> from whence
they beat our Troops, even without charging
them. The ſame was done in other Places of
theſe Countries, where any Garriſon had been left.
At laſt the whole Army return'd into <hi>Poland,</hi> with
the King, who took his March through <hi>Lubownia,</hi>
the Firſt City of his Territories, and arriv'd at
<hi>Cracow</hi> on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Eve. <hi>Lubownia</hi> is a <hi>Staroſty</hi> in
the Mountains, 8 Leagues off <hi>Eperies,</hi> and 12 or
15 from <hi>Cracow.</hi> As to <hi>Czebin,</hi> 'tis ſcituated in a
Bottom, enclos'd with good Walls and Forts, a
large Trench, and ſeveral Stone Bridges, reaching
to the Gates. The Inſide is vere well built, as
are all the other Cities of this part of <hi>Hungary,</hi>
which is the beſt Canton of the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This was the Concluſion of that Glorious Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign;
after which the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Court met at <hi>Cracow,</hi>
where the Queen had waited for her Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
and reſided there all the Winter, to the end
of <hi>March;</hi> when it remov'd into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> in order
to take care of its own State, after having ſav'd
that of its Allie. It was debated, Whether they
ſhould keep a new Army on foot, to oppoſe the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54820:99"/>
                  <hi>Turks,</hi> who were incens'd againſt <hi>Poland,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
violated the Truce ſolemnly ratify'd by an
Ambaſſador, in Favour of a Prince, from whom
they had not the leaſt Hopes of Succour, when
they wanted it. The <hi>Sultan</hi> conferr'd the Office
of Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> on the <hi>Caimacan</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
who was another Black, call'd <hi>Cara.</hi> He ſent as
his <hi>Seraſquier</hi> againſt the <hi>Poles, Suleyman,</hi> a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> a
Man of Eſteem in the Empire, who afterwards
came to be Grand <hi>Viſier;</hi> but of the particulars of
this, we ſhall treat in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>During all theſe Tranſactions, and the March of
the King of <hi>Poland</hi> towards <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary,</hi> the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> tir'd with waiting for my Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
and beginning to perceive that I was leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
than he took me to be, propos'd to me
the ſending a Trooper directly acroſs the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to <hi>Cracow,</hi> and offer'd to releaſe me for 3000
Golden Ducats, and ten <hi>Turks,</hi> inſtead of the 10000
he had firſt inſiſted upon. Tho' I was verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that the King would never part with that
Sum, yet I conſented to the Propoſal, and wrote
what they deſir'd me, looking upon it rather as a
Favourable Opportunity of ſending my News to
the Court, and of hearing ſome from thence, than
as an Overture to my ſpeedy Deliverance. The
<hi>Turk</hi> was diſpatch'd, and fell into the hands of a
Party of Rebels, who perceiving him charg'd with
Letters, directed (ſays he) to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
brought him before Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> taking him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for an <hi>Imperialist Hungarian,</hi> or for a Deſerter.
As good Luck would have it, Count <hi>Forval</hi> was
then with that Prince, who gave him the Pacquet
to read and interpret. <hi>Forval</hi> knew my Hand, and
came to know of my Impriſonment, of which he
had never heard a Word before. He gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it to that <hi>Hungarian</hi> Lord, praying him
at the ſame time not only to permit the Expreſs to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54820:100"/>
go on to <hi>Cracow,</hi> but likewiſe by his own Intereſt,
to endeavour to redeem me from my Slavery.
Count <hi>Teckley</hi> promis'd to do it, and with my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſent one to the King, and <hi>Forval</hi> wrote another
to the Marquiſs <hi>D' Arquyen</hi> to offer his Service in
my Behalf. From hence aroſe a very ſtrict Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
between theſe Perſons: The Marquiſs
wrote to Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> giving him the Title of
<hi>Highneſs;</hi> and the Count anſwer'd him very reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectfully,
and omitted nothing to obtain my Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
not directly by himſelf, for fear of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
himſelf ſuſpected, but by means of the <hi>Bey</hi>
of <hi>Novigrad,</hi> his particular Friend, and the Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
acquaintance of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> who
was his Superiour, the Caſtle of <hi>Novigrad</hi> being
under that <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Juriſdiction. Perhaps this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
might have prov'd ſucceſsful, had it not
been for the delay of the Expreſs, occaſion'd part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the deep Snows, and partly by the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Roads, which the Parties ſent out on
both ſides, made almoſt impaſſible. Beſides, the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> died the beginning of <hi>February,</hi>
even before the Trooper diſpatch'd by him, was
return'd. He brought his Anſwers to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Captain, who had taken me, who commanded in
the City till the Arrival of a new <hi>Baſſa,</hi> or rather
of two new <hi>Baſſas;</hi> for the two who were at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſel</hi>
died the ſame Month. This Captain ſent
me a Letter, which the Marquiſs of <hi>Arquyen</hi> wrote
to me, and deſir'd to know the Contents, that ſo
he might take his Meaſures with the Eldeſt Son
of the deceas'd <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to whoſe ſhare I fell, in the
Diviſion of his Father's Perſonal Eſtate, betwixt
him and his two Brothers. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> would have
bought me at his Hands at a low rate, that ſo he
might have got the Overplus of the Ranſom, if it
had been a pretty round Sum. But ſeeing nothing
was offer'd in Exchange, beſides the <hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Zetzen,</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:54820:100"/>
he left me to make my own bargain with my
Patron who was not in a humour no more than
his Father of delivering thoſe Muſſulmen to
his own prejudice. Thus all the good Wiſhes
of Count <hi>Teckley,</hi> and the preſſing inſtances of
<hi>Forval</hi> were rendered inſignificant by the Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
of this <hi>Bey</hi> my Patron, formerly his Fathers
Kiayia.</p>
               <p>After the Death of the Baſſa of <hi>Newhawſel,</hi> his
three Sons made a Dividend of the Spoil, Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-Goods,
Slaves, Horſes; and lodg'd altogether
in the Place wherein the Deceaſed formerly dwelt,
waiting for the Arrival of his Succeſſor. I was
in ſome hopes of ſome favourable Turn of fortune
by this Death, ſince the <hi>Bey</hi> his Eldeſt Son, had
appeared to me to be more Courteous, Charitable
and of a milder Diſpoſition than his Father. But
I was deceived in my Expectations. For this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Man, who could no longer enrich himſelf
by the Contributions, in which he had now no
ſhare, did almoſt ſtarve us to Death, and kept
himſelf but a very ſtingy Table. So that having
now nothing but a piece of dry bread every day;
and ſome days together, nothing at all to eat, I
was reduced to ſuch a Weakneſs and Faintneſs,
as brought me within a foot of the Grave. Beſides
I was without Cloaths in a Vault that had no
fire in it, laid on the Ground upon two Boards
without either Hay or Straw, and full of Sores
from the Crown of my head to the Sole of my foot.
Thus I lead a languiſhing Life, having no other
Support but the mercy of God, for two whole
Months together; expecting an End to be put to
theſe my Miſeries with as much impatience as I
formerly breath'd after Liberty. One day I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that I went by the door of a Stove that
was kindled, where I ſtop'd a while: The Heat
reviv'd my ſtrength a little, and I perceiv'd my
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54820:101"/>
Spirits refreſh'd by this Help; which gave me to
underſtand, that my Nature was only weaken'd;
and that when warmer Weather came, I might
recover of that languiſhing Malady. However,
this warm Weather was ſtill to come, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
began to be ſcarcer and ſcarcer every Day.
The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had order'd the Garriſons
round about, to hinder the Peaſants from carrying
their Goods to <hi>Newhauſel</hi> Market, as they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
done. A Prohibition was made againſt it,
under the Penalty of being hang'd. The City had
no Wood for Firing; for all the Parts round about
were laid waſte: Its Magazines were husbanded
accordingly to prevent Neceſſity: Thus every
one ſuffer'd alike; <hi>Turks,</hi> Officers, Slaves, and
Horſes. Nothing comes nigh the Frugality of
this Nation, who are contented with a little Meal
moiſten'd, with Coffee, Tobacco, Herbs, and
ſuch like Things; and are as happy in this their
Fare, as the greateſt Senſualiſts pretend to be in
their moſt Luxurious Diet. Provided a City has
Bread, 'tis reckon'd a very good City; and when
a <hi>Turk</hi> enters into Diſcourſe of any foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
the firſt Queſtion he asks is, <hi>Whether it has any
Bread;</hi> and if he commends any Country of their
own Empire, 'tis for that Quality. Honey makes
likewiſe one of the richeſt Repaſts; which they
eat with Butter mixt with it, or elſe ſpred upon
Bread cold. This they learnt from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Tradition, <hi>Mahomet</hi> having retain'd a great many
of their Cuſtoms, as well as Names, and inſerted
a great many Paſſages out of the <hi>Bible,</hi> in his <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;</hi>
particularly this, <hi>Butyrum &amp; Mel comedes, ut
ſcias reprobare malum, &amp; eligere bonum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since I am fall'n into theſe Digreſſions, it will
not be amiſs to add, what I obſerv'd concerning
their Funeral Rites, at the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Funeral. As to
the Eſſential Part of them, they are much the ſame
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54820:101"/>
for all ſorts of People: For among the <hi>Turks</hi> they
make no Diſtinction or Subordination of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Birth, or Profeſſion. They are all Equal, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
their Offices, which only make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction:
ſo that the Sons of a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and the
Grooms of his Stables, when he is dead, are upon
the ſame Level. They eat all together without any
Difference; the Footman with his Maſter, and
both with the Tradeſman; and nothing ſeems
below them, ſince as they are rais'd out of nothing
to the higheſt Poſts, ſo they fall back again from
theſe Dignities into their Primitive Nothing.</p>
               <p>Perſons plac'd in an Office, are the only diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
Men among them, and the Reſpect and
Veneration which is paid to thoſe Officers, cannot
be equall'd by any other Nation. However, Death
equals them with the reſt, and their Funerals do
but very little exceed thoſe of Private Perſons in
in Magnificence. Juſt, as the <hi>Baſſa</hi> died, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Friends, that were about him, ſet up a
great Cry, as taking their laſt Farewel of him.
In <hi>Turky</hi> they do not weep for the Dead, nor ſhew
any other Demonſtration of Sorrow. Afterwards
a Charcoal Fire was kindled in the midſt of his
Palace-Yard, on which they put a Kettle full of
Water, and waſh'd the Body, as it was laid out
upon a Table. After this, they rub'd it over with
Yellow Wax; and laſt of all, wrap'd it up with
Cloth Swaths, as they do the <hi>Egyptian Mummies.</hi>
The Coffin in which he was laid, was cover'd over
with Red Stuff, and the Deceas'd habited in his
uſual Dreſs. At firſt, upon going out of the Houſe,
the Corps was carry'd on the Shoulders of Four
Perſons of Quality; but in marching, every one
who met the Proceſſion, offer'd themſelves to carry
the Coffin a little way, and were again reliev'd by
the next that came; for the <hi>Turks</hi> make a piece of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
of this Cuſtom. The Relations, Friends, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54820:102"/>
Domeſticks of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> follow'd the Bier; whilſt
the Prieſts of the <hi>Moſques,</hi> the Scholars, and others
deſign'd for the Religious Order of the <hi>Muſſulmen,</hi>
went before, chanting forth of Prayers, till they
came to the Church-Yard, which is without the
Walls, where upon a Stone, rais'd like a Pyramid
near the Tomb, is ſet down the Quality of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd,
by certain Figures of the Sabre, the Turbant,
and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>This, in general, is the Funeral Solemnity of the
<hi>Turks;</hi> after which they all return to the Houſe of
the Deceas'd, as uſual, without any token of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
being entirely reſign'd to the Orders of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which is eſteem'd by them as the <hi>Irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible
Fate,</hi> which the Heathen own'd. This ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them more ſteady in Adverſity, leſs proud in
Proſperity, and more patient in Miſery, and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
which they bear with a dry Eye, and after
an Heroical manner. It is not always the Effect of
a great Courage, but often a Blind Refignation to
Providence. There are but few Nations who
have a ſtronger Belief of, and greater Aw for God,
than the <hi>Turks.</hi> They have his Name almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in their Mouths; 'tis their Signal of Battle:
they have a particular Standard, which they call
<hi>The Standard of God,</hi> and marches at the Head of
the Armies. This Standard is Red, ſet off with a
Border in ſmall Squares, incloſing ſeveral Plumes
or Feſtoons with Creſcents: In the midſt is a Sabre
with two Blades, and a Double-guard upon one
ſingle Hilt, plac'd like a pair of Compaſſes, and
all full of Writing; which is a ſort of Myſterious
<hi>Taliſman</hi> in their Religion. On the Top is a large
Creſcent turn'd downwards, ſpotted all over with
<hi>Arabick</hi> Characters, incloſing a Sun betwixt its
Two Horns; as do the other Eight, which are
plac'd Four and Four, on each ſide of the large
Creſcent. The ſpaces between are garniſh'd with
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54820:102"/>
other Figures, and the whole contains Sentences
or Phraſes to the Praiſe of the Living God. There
are other Standards which are wholly plain, of a
Red Silk, and a Green Fringe. That which is
call'd <hi>Mahomet's Standard,</hi> is Green, and has a
Red Fringe; the Chief of which, in the Tents
of the Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> is all full of writing,
without any other Figure or Finery. Whether
they go out, or come in, or enter into any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
they begin and end with <hi>Alla.</hi> When one
among 'em relates any extraordinary Story, he
who hears it, asks him, by way of Admiration,
<hi>Alla Severſen?</hi> that is, <hi>Do you love God?</hi> As if he
ſhould ſay, <hi>Is it certainly true?</hi> In ſhort, this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Name is made uſe of with Reverence in all
the Diſcourſes and Actions of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Five Times a Day they have ſet Prayers, each
<hi>Moſque</hi> having ſome appointed to give notice of
the Hour of Prayer; by certain Form; which they
ſing out aloud upon a Balcony, plac'd for that
purpoſe round a Tower; and thus they call upon
the Faithful, to take them off from their Worldly
Concerns. They begin by turning towards the
Riſing-Sun, and afterwards turn about as the Sun
does, chanting forth the Greatneſs and Power of
the Moſt High. On Friday, which is their Sunday,
(made choice of on purpoſe to diſtinguiſh it from
the <hi>Chriſtian Lord's Day,</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath</hi>) the
Miniſters of the <hi>Moſques</hi> uſe ſome Extraordinary
Ceremonies. Three of 'em get upon the top of
the Tower, ſinging forth other Prayers, beſide the
uſual Invocation of each Day, which is offer'd up
only by a ſingle Perſon. The moſt Religious go
to Prayers at the <hi>Moſque,</hi> others ſay 'em at Home;
and others neither at Home, nor at the <hi>Moſque,</hi> for
there are <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Formaliſts</hi> in all Religions.
In the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Houſe, there is a <hi>Chaous</hi> appointed to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54820:103"/>
give, Notice to all the Domeſticks, by crying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Chamber-Doors, <hi>To Prayers, Gentlemen,
to Prayers;</hi> and the Chief of them go into the
<hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Room, and there put up their Petitions
jointly with him, with a loud Voice; but on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
he goes ſolemnly to the <hi>Moſque</hi> in a Green
Veſt, their Prophet's beloved Colour, there to
offer up the Second Prayer, which is between
Ten and Eleven in the Morning. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of
<hi>Newhauſel,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Alé,</hi> my firſt Maſter,
never fail'd that Duty, and diſtributed large Alms
to the Poor of the City, as they made a Lane to
him, going and coming. I can ſay nothing of their
<hi>Moſques,</hi> for a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> much leſs a Slave, is not
admitted into them, but with extraordinary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions:
But as to their Manner of Prayer, ſince
the <hi>Turks</hi> are not ſo ſecret as to that, I can here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
You with the whole Ceremony, at which I
have been forc'd to Officiate à Thouſand times.</p>
               <p>In the Firſt Place, You muſt know, That all
the <hi>Turks</hi> without exception, riſe every Morning
by Break of Day, at all Seaſons of the Year: That
they make themſelves ready for Prayer, by Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with clean Water their Hands, and Arms up to
the Elbow, their Face, and the inſide of their Noſtrils,
their Mouths, behind their Ears, the top of their
Forehead, and the back part of their Neck. This
they do, by a ſet number of Rubbings, and with
a great many Myſterious Forms, finiſhing the whole
by clapping their wet Hands under their Feet, and
leaving an Impreſſion of their Five Fingers under
their Pumps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſprinkling their Privy-parts
with Water. All this they look upon as eſſentially
neceſſary, and then ſpread a Carpet or Garment,
at the end of which they ſay their Prayers, turning
their Faces towards <hi>Mecca,</hi> where their Prophet is
interred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:54820:103"/>
They begin their Devotion ſtanding upright
with ſeveral Motions of their Hands, which they
clap to their Ears with their Thumbs, afterwards
lay them acroſs their Breaſts; then letting them
hang down, and every now and then fall down on
their Knees, and riſe up again, after they have
kiſs'd the Ground: They end all by Saluting the
two Angels, which they ſuppoſe to be preſent,
and ſitting one upon each Shoulder. This Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they pay very regularly Five times a Day; at
Day-break, between Ten and Eleven a Clock, at
Four in the Afternoon, at Sun-ſet, and when 'tis
quite dark. They always begin with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
Waſhings; and on their more Solemn
Feſtivals, they waſh their Legs up to their Knees,
eſpecially on the Day of the Great <hi>Bairam,</hi> of which
more hereafter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arabic,</hi> which was <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
is that which is moſt us'd among them, as
the <hi>Latin</hi> is in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> All their
Books, all their Prayers, and moſt of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Expeditions are writ in <hi>Arabic,</hi> which
few of the <hi>Turks</hi> do underſtand, tho' they can all
read it; and 'tis a ſign of a great Scholar, to be
able to explain it. This Language is very difficult,
of a harſh Sound, and pronounc'd through the
Throat, whereas the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> is ſoft, eaſie, fluent,
intelligible, and comes pretty near the <hi>Latin,</hi>
without Articles, and thoſe confus'd Phraſes, and
ceremonial Circumlocutious; <hi>Theeing</hi> and <hi>Thouing</hi>
every Body, even God, and the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf;
with Manly Expreſſions in their common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and moving ones in their Songs and Love.
They are as uniform in their Manners, as they are
in their Words. They make no account of the
Wall, ſalute no Body as they go along the Streets,
and ſcarce take Notice of any Body; and if two
Perſons happen to meet, he that comes up firſt is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54820:104"/>
to paſs the Complement, and the other to return
it, but if the firſt ſays nothing, the other is as
ſilent as He. They converſe with one another,
with a free open air and a ſmiling aſpect; and the
Maſter of the houſe paſſes a Civility upon his
Gueſts by giving them the upper hand of his
Couch, offering them Coffee and Tobacco, after
which they depart without ſaluting any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or ſaying a Word, only ſighing devoutly <hi>Alla,</hi>
which is all the Ceremony. The <hi>Turks</hi> know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Cuſtom of clapping the hand to the
hat or mouth, when we expect to receive any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
they are for having it receiv'd juſt as they
give it, without any Ceremony or Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>The Caſe indeed is otherwiſe as to thoſe who
are in any Office: for inſtance, they pay their
Complements to the Baſſas or Perſons of Note,
with both their hands on their breſts, bowing their
heads to the ground very reſpectfully. They who
wait upon them, before and after diſcourſing with
them, kiſs the bottom of their Garment, bringing
it up to their Forehead and Mouth, as they do
the Letters which are directed to them from the
Baſſas and Viſiers. The ſtudents do the ſame after
the Leſſon is over to the Hand or the Veſt of their
Maſter, and this is all the Ceremony of Civility
which I ever obſerved among them.</p>
               <p>By this 'tis eaſy to perceive that their manner
of Converſation is very plain; for beſide this je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>june
or rough way, the <hi>Turks</hi> know nothing of the
Sciences or of Foreign Countries. So that being
only limited to their own Hiſtory, Wars, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and Affairs of their own private Intereſt
or that of the State; their diſcourſes run only up-theſe
Subjects, without any mixture of Gallantry,
leſs known than the Sciences themſelves, ſince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one does that at their own homes with as
many Women as they are able to maintain. When
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54820:104"/>
they are met ſeven or eight in a Room or a Coffee
houſe, The Company deſires one among the reſt
to tell them a ſtory or Fabulous Tradition; and
this Speaker holds forth for an hour together,
all the reſt liſtning very attentively with Pipes in
their Mouths, or Beads in their hands. This is
all the Converſation they have, unleſs it be a game
at Cheſs which they are great Maſters at, but then
they play only for diverſion without any ſtake. So
So that it is no wonder if the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeek for Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in War, or in Handicraft Trades and
Mechanicks, in which they excell even to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
nothing being comparable, to the beauty
neatneſs, and delicacy of all that is made uſe of
by them.</p>
               <p>Tis not the ſame with reſpect to their Table
and Buildings. The <hi>Turks</hi> being uſed to, or
rather bred up under Tents, never mind having
fine houſes, nor do they build any, nor repair
thoſe in the Towns which they take. Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for them to be under ſhelter, and to
have their Couches or Stately <hi>Sophas;</hi> which is
all the houſhold Goods they mind, having no
Tapeſtry or Hangings on their Walls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor any
other Pictures unleſs <hi>Rebesk</hi> Work, or any Beds
or Chairs, but rich Carpets and fine Coverlets.
Good feeding is a ſtranger to them. They eat
purely to ſuſtain Life, and make it a buſineſs of
neceſſity, not of Pleaſure. The Table call'd <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fra</hi>
is commonly a round piece of Leather, faſten'd
with ſtrings like a Purſe, which they hang up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a Wall, when they have done eating. On
this <hi>Sofra</hi> they lay neither Cloth nor Napkin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
ſome pieces of bread round about, a ſingle Diſh
in the middle; out of which every one eats, which
is ſupplied by another as that is Empty, for they
have never two diſhes laid on together. Each
Man has his knife hanging by his ſide, and a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54820:105"/>
Handkerchief ſerves inſtead of a Napkin, the
Word <hi>Marama</hi> in their Language being uſed to
ſignifie both a Handkerchief and a Napkin.</p>
               <p>Their food is no richer than this their <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus.</hi>
They feed very much upon Rice, upon
upon Wheat bak'd with their Meat, and a great
deal of Fleſh cut out into ſmall pieces like a
Fricaſſée. Their Kitchin-Ware conſiſts only in
Pots, and their plate is the covers of thoſe pots
made of Tin, deep and large, which ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Diſhes, for they have no other, nor any
piece of Plate ſuch as Spoons, Knives and Forks;
for theſe laſt are all of Horn or fine Wood, ſet
with ſmall Pearls. Even the Baſſas, Viſiers, and
others are forbidden to eat in Plate.</p>
               <p>That wherein the Tables of Perſons of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
appear more ſplendid than thoſe of other men,
is the Number of Diſhes: for I ſaw fifty ſerved
up one after another in the Treat which the
New Baſſa made upon his Arrival, in the Open
field under his Tents. The Table was a round
piece of Tin, with a ſmall border, placed upon an
Iron frame about a foot high: upon it were laid
pieces of Bread with Spoons, and the Gueſts ſat ſo
as not to look into one another's faces, eating ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
their Right-hands and ſides turn'd toward
the Table. At the Baſſa's Table is ſerved up
inſtead of a Napkin, a great piece of Cotton ſtuff
dy'd in blue or various Colours, which is throw'n
upon the knees of the Gueſts, beginning with the
Maſter. This is all the diſtinction between his
and other private Perſon's Tables; for they all
alike eat very faſt without much talking; One
diſh does not ſtay long for another, as ſoon as
tis Empty, the Maſter of the feaſt cries <hi>take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
and fifty of 'em are by this means gon in
leſs than a quarter of an hour. Both Drink and
ſide-board are much of a ſort. Perſons of note
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54820:105"/>
indeed have their Leathern Bottles, and turn'd
Cups; and the Baſſa upon a Journey has a Man
on purpoſe to carry his Carpet for Prayers, with
a Bottle full of Water and a piece of Bread. There
is not much more Ceremony uſed in waiting at
Table; the Slaves fetch the Diſhes out of the
Kitchin, and lay them in the Antichamber, where
Grooms of the Chamber call'd <hi>Meter</hi> take them,
and one of 'em places them upon the Table.</p>
               <p>I have elſewhere obſerved that the <hi>Turks</hi> wear
no other Arms in times of Peace and at home,
but a Dagger tuck'd in at their Girdle on the
right ſide: and here I add that Quarrels are
very rare among them. Ralleries, Love-Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
Gaming, Wine, Suits at Law, Intrigues of
Court, Backbiting, and the like; which occaſion
quarrels in other Nations, have no Influence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
theſe People: Every one lives in his own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without concerning himſelf with what is done
abroad. They have nothing they can call their
own but their Houſhold Goods, their Money,
Horſes and Slaves, for all the Lands belong
to the Grand Signior. They never intrude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
other People's buſineſs; they carry on no Plots
with another Man's Wife or Daughter; for they
may keep as many Women as they pleaſe; and
what cauſe then is there of falling out? I never
ſo much as ſaw any thing like it in all the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Months of my ſtay at <hi>Newhauſel.</hi> The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
deal upon the ſquare, The Workmen are
paid punctually, and every thing is carry'd on
among them without Trick or Fraud according
to the genuine Law of Nature. Their Juſtice
is ſevere, their Obedience blind, their Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd,
and Robberies are ſcarce known among
them, by the care that is taken to root up the very
ſeeds of ſuch a Practice: So that they lock up
nothing, their Chambers, Coffers, and Cheſts do
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54820:106"/>
all lye open: And were it not for that ſordid
Avarice, to which all the <hi>Turks</hi> are inclin'd,
and a propenſity to a certain dreadfull piece of
debauchery, to which they are more addicted
than the <hi>Italians,</hi> and all other Nations of the
World beſides, were it not, I ſay, for theſe things,
they would equal any other People in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have two Lents in the Year call'd
<hi>Ramaſan,</hi> each laſting a Month or a Moon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their way of Reckoning. The leſſer is Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary,
and falls out towards the latter end of
<hi>October</hi> or the beginning of <hi>November.</hi> The
Great Lent (at the end of which is the Solemn
Feſtival of <hi>Bairam,</hi> look'd upon as our Eaſter)
which is likewiſe called <hi>Ramaſan Bairam,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly
neceſſary to be obſerved among them.
In the Year 1684, it began <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 12th ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our Account, which was the firſt
day of the Moon. The faſt they keep at that
time was very irkſome by reaſon of the long
days; For they eat nothing till after Sun-ſet, and
the Lamps are lighted, which are placed during
all that time upon the top of the Towers of their
Moſques. Theſe are lighted when the day is
ſuppos'd to be at an end by the Courſe of the
Sun, which likewiſe puts a Period to the Faſt for
that day: and then every body betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to their Victuals, breaking their faſt firſt
of all by large draughts of Water. Beſides this
grand Repaſt, they make another Meal almoſt
as large as the firſt, two hours before day: So
that it may be ſaid that they Eat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
all Night; and Sleep without eating all the
next day. During the <hi>Ramaſan</hi> their Prayers are
double, and the moſt indevout fail not of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them every day of this Lent, which is ſo
much reverenc'd by all perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:54820:106"/>
On the Morrow after the laſt day of <hi>Ramaſan,</hi>
they celebrate the <hi>Bairam</hi> juſt as they did the
firſt day of Lent, by diſcharging all the Cannon,
by the ſounding of Warlike Inſtruments, beating
of Drums and the Like. After this by break
of day they wait upon the <hi>Baſſa</hi> with their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
who after he had waſhed his feet (a cuſtom
ſtrictly obſerved by every body on the morning
of this feſtival) mounted his horſe and marched
in great State to the Moſque, there to offer up
his firſt Prayers. Whilſt this was doing the
Cooks were ſerving up a great Treat in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Square before his Palace all in Earthen
Diſhes to the Number of three or four hundred.
Several Janizaries were poſted at the four Corners
to keep the People off, till the Baſſa and his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcade
return'd from the Moſque. Then thoſe
Guards fell upon the Diſhes, and all the crowd
at the ſame time, take ſhare of the Treat, of
which nothing remains a moment after, beſides
the pieces of Diſhes which are broken between
them in the Squabble. They told me at <hi>Newhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi>
that the Grand Signior himſelf celebrated the
<hi>Bairam</hi> juſt after the ſame manner, and that this
Repaſt was call'd <hi>Corban.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have likewiſe another Moon which is
that of <hi>March,</hi> in which they perform ſeveral No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal
and private Devotions, of which I ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Proceſſions of the <hi>Dervis</hi> made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
in the paſſage between the two Gates of the
Baſſa's houſe. The next confiſted in lamentable
Howlings and ſecret Superſtitions of which I only
heard the Noiſe, which was very dreadful in my
mind. They attend at their Devotions at all
times with a modeſty that is hardly conceiveable
in Perſons ſo addicted to Laſcivious Embraces.
Their privities are cover'd very carefully by a
pair of Drawers reaching down to their feet, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54820:107"/>
Shirts over them reaching down to their heels.
So that a Modeſt Woman is not more cautious as
to this Point then theſe Luſtful Satyrs are. As
often as they go into their Wardrobe to dreſs
themſelves, they always carry along with them
a baſon of Water, with which they waſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
very carefully; beſides making uſe of the
Bagnio's to which they go almoſt once a Week.
The Bagnios of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> in which I was five
or ſix times, have a large Room ſet out with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
whereon to undreſs one's ſelf, a Wooden
machine in the midſt, on which there hung linnen
towels to dry ones ſelf. Before you put off your
ſhift, a boy belonging to the Bagnio gives you
one of theſe towels to cover your Nudities,
which is not to be taken off till you put on your
ſhirt again. He ſupplies you with wooden Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and in this poſture you go through two or
three ſmall Vaulted Rooms, and enter into another
where are benches on the four ſides, upon which
you are placed. Over your head is a Ciſtern with
two Cocks, the one of cold and the other of
hot Water. The Man who belongs to the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio
makes uſe of a certain liquid Sope perfum'd
with musk, and a rubbing cloath of courſe ſtuff
which ſcours to admiration. At the cloſe of all
he throws on a great deal of Water, but ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
as not to touch the Privities, which he
leaves for the perſon to waſh himſelf, if he pleaſes.
The Women are under as ſtrict a Confinement as
they are in <hi>Italy:</hi> Thoſe who walk in the ſtreets
are cloath'd in a great Gown with large Sleeves
and a Veil over their Faces, ſo that they can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee their way thro' the Veil which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very tranſparent. The Baſſa had thirty Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Slaves ſhut up in an upper Room whither
two old Eunuchs carry'd them Proviſion twice
a day, and the Baſſa gave them Viſits between
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54820:107"/>
whiles; but the <hi>Baſtile</hi> it ſelf has not a Stronger
Guard upon it than this <hi>Seraglio,</hi> out of which
they go once a month attended with two Matrons
to the Bagnio. I only mention ſuch particulars as
are not ſo well known to the World, and paſs
by thoſe that every body is acquainted with, and
which are to be met with in ſeveral Hiſtories, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in the Account of an Engliſh Gentleman
(Sir <hi>Paul Ricaut</hi>) who has deſcrib'd the Cuſtoms
and Government of the <hi>Turks</hi> better than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Writer. All I ſhall add here is, that <hi>Coffee</hi> is
(as all men know) their conſtant Liquor, Pots
of it ſtanding always by the Fire in Gentlemen's
houſes. <hi>Tobacco</hi> is as much eſteem'd among them
being very good in <hi>Turky</hi> by being duly prepar'd
and taken in long Pipes, which the Smokers find
to be very pleaſant. As for <hi>Opium,</hi> ſaid to be ſo
much uſed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> I am apt to believe that
in ſome parts they may like it in ſuch quantities as
is related; but yet at <hi>Newhauſel</hi> I never ſaw any
perſon take it, nor ever heard the leaſt mention
made of it. I took as much notice as poſſible of
their way of Living, their Cuſtoms, their private
Tranſactions and their Family, and I ſo often
ſhifted my lodgings and my Maſter, that I could
not but have known ſomething of this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
if there had been any thing in it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> are very induſtrious, and know how
to turn their hands to every thing that is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for human life. They mend the furniture
of their horſes themſelves and brighten them;
they mend their own Cloths, having always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them in a leathern Caſe a Needle, Thread,
and other materials proper for the buſineſs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſuch induſtrious People as theſe are, a
<hi>French</hi> Gentleman is a mere <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> and they
look'd upon me as a very dull Soul, becauſe I
could not tell ſo much as how to light a fire;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54820:108"/>
which among them is an inſupportable Fault in
their Slaves. They perpetually upbraided me
for this my Inſufficiency; and they could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
how any Man below a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> or great Perſon
of Quality, ſhould be ſo ſhiftleſs, as to ſtand in
need of another's Aſſiſtance, even in the minuteſt
matters. They take a ſpecial care of their Horſes,
which they waſh even with Sope. The fineſt,
which are of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Breed, are never ty'd
any otherwiſe than by the Leg to a Tether, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Halter, Rack, or Manger; for they give
'em their Oats or Barley in a ſort of Bags, call'd
<hi>Tourba.</hi> When they alight off their Backs, tho'
they be a hundred in Company, they will not let
'em be rub'd down, but are walk'd ſoftly for half
an hour, in the Street, before they are carry'd to
the Stable. This was our Buſineſs; when the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> came off a Journey, the Slaves took his Men's
Horſes, and walk'd 'em about the Streets. They
Diſcipline them ſo as to turn about every way, that
ſo they may manage the Sabre, or caſt the Dart, at
which Exerciſe the <hi>Turks</hi> are very expert; nor
are they put to much trouble in it, ſince their
Horſes are neatly built, light, ſwift, of a ſound
Wind, and admirably well mouth'd; being no
skittiſh, reſty, or founder'd Jades. The <hi>Turks</hi>
alſo manage them extraordinary well, and are
fix'd upon the Stirrups, which are much like thoſe
of our Women's Saddles, and ty'd up very ſhort;
but yet they ſit up very upright and ſteady, which
makes their Cavalry ſo good, and ſo vigorous in
the Charge.</p>
               <p>The moſt conſiderable Cavalry is that of the
<hi>Spahi,</hi> call'd in their Language <hi>Spaha,</hi> which is
compos'd of Gentlemen that ſerve at their own
Expences, in conſideration of ſome Village or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſne,
which they hold of the Grand Signior, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Life. They are diſpers'd over the whole
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54820:108"/>
                  <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and are reckon'd to be 80000 who
have thoſe Eſtates that are call'd <hi>Timars,</hi> and 32000
Mercenaries.</p>
               <p>The other Cavalry is much like the <hi>French,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
either of conquer'd Countries, or of Allies,
or of Mercenaries of their own Nation; having
Colonels or Commanders, nam'd <hi>Allay-Bey:</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reckoning the <hi>Militia</hi> of the ſeveral Provinces,
which are rais'd upon extraordinary Expeditions.
Thoſe laſt are call'd <hi>Sangiacs,</hi> or Companies of
the <hi>Arriere-Ban,</hi> no leſs vigorous than the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Troops. They have likewiſe a ſort of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
arm'd with Musquets like thoſe of the
Infantry, which are alſo call'd <hi>Yancharz,</hi> from the
Name of <hi>Yancharz</hi> or <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who beſtow this
Title on the Arms which they make uſe of.
There are two ſorts of Infantry; The <hi>Janizaries,</hi>
who are properly the Grand Signior's Guards, and
are a Formidable Body of Men, as well for their
Number, as their Courage; They, like the <hi>Spaha,</hi>
are diſpers'd over all the Provinces, and enjoy cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Privileges, which make them to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.
This Body of Foot have a Commander
in Chief, of great Authority in the Empire, call'd
<hi>Yanchar-Aga,</hi> or <hi>Aga of the Janizaries:</hi> who
marches in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with a numerous Retinue
at his Heels, and ſeveral Executioners of Juſtice,
who carry Bundles of Rods to puniſh upon the
ſpot in the middle of the Street, thoſe that are
complain'd of to him, as he goes along. Both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Modern Hiſtories are full of Remarkable
Relations, concerning this Body of Infantry, which
have rais'd ſuch frequent Inſurrections, and ſo
many Revolts, even to the Depoſing of <hi>Sultans,</hi>
demanding the Heads of <hi>Viſiers;</hi> and other ſuch
extraordinary Diſturbances. 'Tis ſaid they are
about 40000 ſtrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:54820:109"/>
The other ſort of Infantry, is call'd by the <hi>Turks
Seymen,</hi> and differ nothing from that of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
having nothing of Diſtinction, either in
their Privileges, or in their Habits, wearing a plain
Cap hanging down behind, call'd <hi>Calpac;</hi> whereas
the <hi>Janizaries</hi> have a white Turbant, and green
Coats; as I deſcrib'd them before, in ſpeaking of
the King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Guards. The <hi>Agas</hi> or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of theſe <hi>Seymen,</hi> are call'd <hi>Tchorbaggey,</hi> of
which there is a Commander in chief, in every
Garriſon of a Town, honour'd with the Title of
<hi>Yanchar-Aga,</hi> and who is properly the Colonel of
the Infantry of the Town. This may ſuffice in
general to give You a Light into thoſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
of which former Hiſtories have taken no
notice. As to the Places of War, that little Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution
which the <hi>Turks</hi> make uſe of to cover them,
may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange. They have no Body
of Guards in the Streets, nor any Sentinels by Day
upon the Ramparts near their Artillery, nor any
great number at the Gates. Indeed they have
nothing to fear within, becauſe the Cities they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
are re-peopled by the Natural <hi>Turks;</hi> and in
proceſs of Time, the People of the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
greater <hi>Turks</hi> than the ancient <hi>Muſſelmen.</hi> This
I obſerv'd at <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> where the <hi>Hungarians</hi> that
were turn'd <hi>Mahometans,</hi> were the moſt zealous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of the Place. There were in the Town
but few <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahas</hi> of Ancient Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſome other <hi>Turks,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Greeks, Aſiatics</hi> and
<hi>Levantines,</hi> all the reſt were <hi>Hungarian</hi> Horſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
ſtill the Habit and Language of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
with the Religion and Notion of the true
Original <hi>Turks.</hi> It was they who went out in Parties,
and ſcour'd the Country round about: It was they
who guarded the Priſons, where the Slaves were
kept; and the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Infantry compos'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the greateſt part of the Garriſon. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54820:109"/>
of fixing the Guard conſiſts in thoſe Nightly
Rounds, which a Body of Foot make, going upon
the Ramparts with large Lanterns, and ſtopping
at every Baſtion, to ſet up a hideous Cry, calling
upon the Name of the <hi>Most Bleſſed God:</hi> and this
they do without any intermiſſion till Break of Day,
when they all go off, even the Sentinels of the
Watch-Towers. Theſe laſt carry their Rugs along
with them to lie on, and their Duty is from time
to time, to cry <hi>Alla,</hi> in anſwer to thoſe that walk
the Rounds. This was all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Party of
Foot, at leaſt all that I ever ſaw at <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Reviews, or in their Exerciſe: and I
learnt from ſeveral <hi>German</hi> Officers, That during
the Siege of <hi>Buda,</hi> and other Places, the Night
Round made the ſame Cries, and had the ſame
Guard.</p>
               <p>A great many People believe, that the Office of
<hi>Viſier</hi> is confin'd only to one ſingle Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and till
then, I was of the ſame Opinion: but at <hi>Newhauſel</hi>
I was inform'd, That beſides the <hi>Prime-Viſier,</hi> call'd
likewiſe <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> or <hi>Viſier Aſem,</hi> there were
ſix others, which compos'd the <hi>Divan,</hi> or Council
of the Empire. But of each of theſe, we have
already given a particular Account Chap. III.
Next to the <hi>Viſiers,</hi> are the other Governours of
the Province, call'd <hi>Becglerbeys,</hi> who are only two,
tho' frequently he who is no <hi>Viſier,</hi> has a larger Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Government. For Inſtance: The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of
<hi>Temeſwaer</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> has a conſiderable Province
or <hi>Becglerbeyat,</hi> compos'd of one half of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
conquer'd by the <hi>Turks</hi> in that Kingdom;
and yet he is no <hi>Viſier.</hi> Next to theſe, come all
the <hi>Baſſas,</hi> which either ſerve in the Army, or in
places of Importance, who have only one Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayl,
to which the <hi>Sultan,</hi> for ſome Signal ſervice,
adds a ſecond, and a third, for which they pay 20000
Crowns in 40 Purſes, as has been already mention'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:54820:110"/>
Here I muſt inform the Publick, That the Name
of <hi>Baſſa</hi> is a Title of Honour, belonging to the
Perſon, not to the Office they are in: So that the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire hath a great many <hi>Baſſas</hi> without
any Office or Command; and thoſe who have
any ſuch, never take upon them the Name of the
Place where they are Governours, but only their
own Perſonal Title. Thus for Inſtance; The
<hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> was call'd <hi>Aſſan Pacha,</hi> and not
<hi>Ouywar Pacha, Ouywar</hi> being the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Word to
ſignifie <hi>Newhauſel;</hi> and ſo of the reſt. Beſides,
this Title in common Converſation, is by way of
Compliment given to Private Perſons; and at the
end of my Slavery, when the Exchange was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
upon, they honour'd me with the ſame
Title, calling me <hi>Franſous Pacha,</hi> as much as to
ſay an <hi>Illuſtrious Frenchman.</hi> Of theſe <hi>Baſſas</hi> ſome
are made Governors of Provinces and Cities;
others <hi>Seraſquiers</hi> or Generals, and others the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Officers in the Armies, which are Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to the former, who all of them retain the
Title of <hi>Baſſa,</hi> without taking upon them any new
one by their Office. Thus for Example, The <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers</hi>
do not ſtile themſelves <hi>The Viſier of Buda,</hi> of
<hi>Siliſtria,</hi> of <hi>Boſnia, &amp;c.</hi> but rather <hi>Boudin-Pacha,
Siliſtri-Pacha, Boſnié-Pacha.</hi> The <hi>Becglerbeys,</hi> and
General Officers of the Army do the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the Title of <hi>Sultan,</hi>
which is not appropriated to the <hi>Grand-Signior</hi>
only, as moſt People imagine; and only ſignifies
<hi>Protector, Benefactor, Patron, Maſter.</hi> For all the
<hi>Turks</hi> in general, when they diſcourſe together,
give one another this Title, as we do that of <hi>Sir,</hi>
or <hi>Maſter.</hi> But foraſmuch as the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
the <hi>Great Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and their Sons or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are reckon'd Patrons and Protectors in a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſenſe than ordinary, therefore they are by way of
Eminence ſtiled <hi>Sultan.</hi> Thus they ſay, <hi>Mehemet
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54820:110"/>
Sultan,</hi> which is the Grand Signior; <hi>Suleyman Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
which is his Brother; <hi>Gherei Sultan,</hi> which
is the Cham of <hi>Tartary; Galga Sultan, Nuradin Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
which are his Sons or Brothers. The proper
Title therefore which the <hi>Turks</hi> have given to
their Emperor, is that of <hi>Padicha,</hi> ſignifying the
<hi>Lord and Maſter of all the rest:</hi> and as a token of
Reſpect, and that particular Eſteem which they
have for the King of <hi>France,</hi> they have conferr'd
upon him only that great Title of <hi>Padicha,</hi> or <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perer
of the French. England</hi> would have given
100000 Crowns for that Favour, but could not
obtain it: as they would have had the <hi>Sopha</hi> at the
Audiences, granted at laſt to the Embaſſador of
<hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> in the Perſon of Mr. <hi>De Guille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragues,</hi>
about ten Years ago. This conſiſts of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Cuſhion-ſtool ſet upon the ſame Floor with
the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> whereas formerly they ſat below,
as the Embaſſadors of other Kings do to this Day,
that is below the place, that is rais'd above the reſt
of the Floor, particularly call'd the <hi>Sopha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Title of <hi>Baſſa</hi> ought not be confounded
with that of <hi>Bachy,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> give to the
Chief Perſons of every Profeſſion; as to the Head-Gardner,
the Head-Cook, the Chief-Footman, and
to all other Principal Perſons of what Order ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
So likewiſe the Title of <hi>Aga,</hi> is given to all
the Chief Officers of the Houſhold; to the <hi>Tef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdar,</hi>
who is the Treaſurer or Receiver General;
to the <hi>Aſnadar,</hi> who is the Intendant, or Pay-maſter
of a Private Family; to the <hi>Silictar,</hi> who takes care
of his Maſter's Arms, and is his Squire, or Captain
of the Guards; to the <hi>Kiayia,</hi> who is the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of a <hi>Viſier,</hi> or <hi>Baſſa</hi> that Commands the
Place, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Turbants make ſeveral diſtinctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Perſons and Officers, as may be diſcover'd
both by the Colour and Faſhion of them. They
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54820:111"/>
conſiſt of two parts, the Bonnet call'd <hi>Cauk,</hi> and
the Scarf twiſted round about call'd <hi>Sarret.</hi>
The <hi>Turks</hi> deſcended from the Race of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
otherwiſe call'd <hi>Emirs,</hi> have only the right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of wearing the Green Bonnet. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
indeed there is ſome Relaxation of it, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
at <hi>Newhawſel;</hi> but yet tis a Law, as all the
<hi>Turks</hi> have aſſur'd me. As to the Scarf, tis common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
white, of Silk or very fine Linnen. There are
ſome of red, green, and Orange-colour'd Taffata;
which the Baſſa made uſe of, when he went to
the War. The Turbant of Quality which the
Viſiers, the Governors, and the Sultan himſelf
wear, is red, and the Scarf white, turn'd about
after a particular manner and of a moderate Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
The <hi>Cudis</hi> or Men of the Law wear a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant
pretty large at the Top, and narrow at the
bottom, like the Spaniſh Hats: The Scarf ſpred
over, covering the Bonnet almoſt quite up to the
top. The <hi>Imans,</hi> or Prieſts of the Moſques wear
a Violet Turbant, very large and deep; The
Scarf is plaited into ſmall ſquares very artificially.
It would be two tedious to particularize the other
Diſtinctions; but I muſt not omit two Eſſential
Ones, which give the Nation its Name: 'Tis that
of the Colour of the Turbant which the <hi>Perſians</hi>
wear, whoſe Bonnet and Scarf are red; which
makes the <hi>Turks</hi> call them <hi>Keſel-bach, Red-pates.</hi>
Their Religion likewiſe gives them another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
but ſcandalous Title. For tho' they own
the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> yet they follow therein the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of one nam'd <hi>Ali,</hi> reputed as an Heretick
among the <hi>Turks;</hi> ſo that they call the <hi>Perſians</hi> and
other People of that Sect, as they do the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>Ghiaour, Miſcreants, Infidels.</hi> They look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Perſians</hi> as <hi>greater miſcreants</hi> of the two;
their Sirname of <hi>Daa-Fena</hi> ſignifing the ſame thing
literally. The <hi>Turks</hi> have a leſs opinion for the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54820:111"/>
                  <hi>Jews,</hi> tho' their Religion is the very Foundation
of <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> from whom the Prophet has bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
ſeveral Names, the Circumciſion, and other
Eſſential Points of the Law; The Prohibition of
eating Swine's fleſh, with the Prohibition of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and Sculptures: yet that accurſed Race is
ſo far an offence to the <hi>Turks,</hi> by that miſerable
Condition to which they are reduc'd, being Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds,
ſordid and Mercenary, that they will not
admit any of 'em to make a Profeſſion, till they
have abjur'd <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and been baptiz'd as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
So that tis not a <hi>Jew</hi> but a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that
becomes a <hi>Muſſulman;</hi> and among their moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Reflections which they caſt upon Men, that of
<hi>Jew</hi> is the moſt biteing, calling the Chriſtian
Slaves by that Title, preſuming it will affront them
more, than Calling them only <hi>Ghiaour</hi> or <hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every body is acquainted with the Manners of
the <hi>Dervis,</hi> which are a ſort of Auſtere Monks,
as they call them; and moſt People fancy them
to be Recluſes and Solitaries. I ſaw three of 'em
at <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> living among other Men, not ſhut
up in a Cloyſter or Monaſtery, but ſmoaking,
eating, and drinking with all manner of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as the reſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> do. That which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes
them is their habit which is of white
Cloth, made much like that of the <hi>Bernardine</hi>
Monks without a Capuchion; but inſtead of that
they have a hat of whitiſh Felt, cut indenturewiſe
round the Brim, which is in a very Ridiculous
manner cut into four Corners. The <hi>Dervis</hi> goe
barefoot without Sandals, without Linnen; wear
on their Breſt a great Medal of ſomething like
yellow Amber; They have Bracelets and Pendants
of the ſame in their Ears, which ſtill render them
more Rediculous. Tis certain that at firſt ſight you
would take a fool and a <hi>Dervis</hi> running through
the Streets for one and the ſame thing. Their
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54820:112"/>
Devotion is terrible: for in their Fits of <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſins,</hi>
they burn or tear their Fleſh; and the firſt
that I ſaw at the <hi>Kiayia</hi>'s Houſe, tho' a meek-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd,
honeſt, and charitable Man, yet had both
his Arms full of Scars. They pray to God by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves round; at firſt only leaping and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering,
and afterwards as ſwift as the turning
round of a Milſtone, which makes them ſo giddy,
that they daſh themſelves againſt the Walls, and
fall in a Trance upon the Ground, out of which
they hardly recover. The <hi>Turks</hi> have a great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
for theſe Monks; and when they would
extol the Piety of any Perſon, they ſay that he is
of the Sect of the <hi>Dervis;</hi> pretending thereby to
denote a more perfect Life and Religion, than that
of the ordinary <hi>Muſſulmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Alé</hi> and <hi>Muſtapha, Baſſas</hi> of
<hi>Newhauſel,</hi> the Goverment of the Place devolv'd
upon the Commanders of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahas;</hi>
the firſt ſtil'd <hi>Yanchar Aga,</hi> or <hi>Tchorbagey;</hi> the
other <hi>Alay-Bey.</hi> In the mean time an Expreſs
was ſent to the <hi>Port,</hi> to receive the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's
Orders, who ſent thither two other <hi>Baſſas,</hi>
to ſupply the Places of the Deceas'd; both of 'em
Men of Merit, and who had really grown gray
in the Field of Battle: The Firſt, nam'd <hi>Aſſan
Pacha,</hi> a Man of Merit, a good Head-piece, of an
extraordinary Conduct, an <hi>Albanian</hi> by Birth, and
conſequently a good Soldier. He had ſerv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the two <hi>Cupreolis,</hi> and at the Siege of <hi>Candy;</hi>
was about 65 Years old, had a Venerable grey
Beard, a lively tho' tann'd Complection, ſparkling
Eyes, and a rough Aſpect: but withall he had a
Noble and Charitable Soul, was eaſie of Acceſs,
Affable and Courteous, a lover of his Nation and
his Emperor, an exact and faithful <hi>Muſſulman</hi> to
outward Appearance, but yet one who had got
over the Scruples of their Law; for he drank
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54820:112"/>
Wine in ſecret; lov'd both Sexes, tho' he puniſh'd
ſeverely others who tranſgreſs'd in theſe Points.</p>
               <p>The Second <hi>Baſſa,</hi> nam'd <hi>Alé,</hi> was at leaſt 70,
as white as a Swan, dry and wither'd, of a ſweet
Mein, and red Countenance; but his Air old, and
his <hi>Phyſiognomy</hi> like a <hi>Rabbi,</hi> wrinkled through Age
and Study. However, he was ſtrong, ſat upright
on his Horſe, and was as couragious as any Man;
as the <hi>Germans</hi> experienc'd him to be at the Aſſault
they made upon <hi>Newhauſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two <hi>Baſſas</hi> arriv'd about <hi>May</hi> with a
new Train of <hi>Levantine-Turks,</hi> ſome Courtiers,
and ſuch as were more refin'd than thoſe of the
Frontiers of <hi>Hungary,</hi> as I found afterwards by
ſweet Experience. All the Garriſon, and the Sons
of the Deceas'd <hi>Baſſa,</hi> with their Retinue, went
out by Break of Day, to give them the Meeting.
The <hi>Janizaries</hi> with their white Turbants went
out on Horſeback with their Colours flying, and
all the Artillery of the Place receiv'd them under
two Salvo's. The three <hi>Beys,</hi> Sons to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> yielded up the Palace wherein their
Father had dwelt, to his Succeſſor, and encamp'd
with all their Family on a Baſtion. This gave me
an Opportunity of taking a full View of the City,
and the Out-parts; the <hi>Turks</hi> not being ſuſpicious,
and ſuffering the Slaves to walk round upon their
Ramparts. My Maſter ſent me for a Fortnight to
one of his Friends nam'd <hi>Caplana,</hi> an old Officer,
and one of thoſe <hi>Veteranes,</hi> that have left off War
to turn Courtiers. He was a Man of Pleaſure, and
very well belov'd among the Perſons of Chief
Note. I met with two <hi>Poliſh</hi> Slaves in his Houſe,
who refreſh'd me with plenty of Proviſions. But
this did not laſt long; for <hi>Caplana,</hi> being afraid I
ſhould make my Eſcape, was for ridding his hands
of me, and ſo brought me back again to the Baſtion
to my Patron's Tents; who committed me to the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54820:113"/>
cuſtody of his Cook, a <hi>Coſack</hi> by Nation, but a
Renegado; or rather bred up from his Infancy in
<hi>Mahometiſm.</hi> For he had been taken very young,
and knew nothing of his own Country, or the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Language, but what he had learnt in <hi>Turky;</hi>
yet ſtill retain'd the Humanity and Good-nature of
a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> I lay near him in his Cabin, and liv'd
pretty pleaſantly with the ſweat of my Brows, for
I ſerv'd in the Kitchin, waſhing of Plates and
Diſhes, and making the Pot boil.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Baſtion on which we were, had on
its Platform a Watch-Tower, and ſurrounded
with Galleries, from whence they could deſcry a
pleaſant Proſpect towards the <hi>Danube,</hi> the Iſle of
of <hi>Schut,</hi> and the open Country round about <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morne;</hi>
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> came very often thither to ſpend
his Afternoons, in playing at Cheſs, ſmoking, and
drinking of Coffee: and his Retinue cloth'd in
white, as the <hi>Turks</hi> are in Summer, exercis'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the mean time upon the Level of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
in darting of Sticks one at another, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
their Arms, for the Caſting of Javelins. I
ſcarce ever ſaw them draw the Bow, tho' they
wear them in the War; but 'tis rather for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than for Service: their Dexterity being only
confin'd to the Uſe of the Javelin, and the Sabre.
And truly, the <hi>Turks</hi> are very expert in managing
the latter, whoſe Blades are very good. I have
ſeen Heads cut off, without perceiving the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Arm. The Profit which they get by
it, contributes very much to make the <hi>Turks</hi> ſo
dexterous at it: The Officers pay them ſo much
for every Head, which they bring from the Field
of Battle; which occaſions nothing but Headleſs
Trunks to be left behind. You may ſee thouſands
of thoſe Heads, planted upon the Palliſſades of
their Cities, or upon a great Tree ſet up at the
Gate, and full of Spikes, on which they hang the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54820:113"/>
Heads of the Enemies. When they return back
from the <hi>Patrole,</hi> the firſt Queſtion that is ask'd of
the Party, is, <hi>Where is the Head?</hi> that is to ſay,
the token of their Courage.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Baſſa</hi> goes abroad, either on a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or on a Military Expedition, all the Cavalry
and all his Family attend him, in a great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
Company. Before him goes the Muſick,
which conſiſts of three or four Hautboys, with a
pair of ſmall pleaſant Kettle-drums, which the
<hi>Turks</hi> are very dextrous in beating: A large
<hi>Bonchouk</hi> after the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Faſhion, without any
Ornament; another ſmall Kettle-drum, beat now
then, with a large Thong of Leather; and he who
carries it upon the Pummel of his Saddle, goes
next before the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who has always at his Horſe's
Head a Footcloth-man, cloth'd like the <hi>Pahiques</hi> of
the K. of <hi>Poland,</hi> call'd <hi>Chater-Bacha,</hi> who ſerves to
aſſiſt him in Mounting and Alighting off his Horſe.
He has two or three other Footmen, nam'd <hi>Chaous,</hi>
whoſe Buſineſs is to draw out Commiſſions, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
out Letters and Orders. The Grand Signior
diſpatches them to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, to his own
Subjects for Preſents, or to get Intelligence. The
<hi>Baſſas</hi> have three or four of them; and the Badge
of their Office, is a Black Rod, tipp'd with Silver,
on the Top of which is a double Beak of the ſame
Metal; from whence on each ſide hangs a Chain
with large Balls at the End, which they carry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Maſter. Theſe Perſons are very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
and of Honourable Employs.</p>
               <p>I muſt not omit another <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ceremony, which
is obſerv'd when the <hi>Baſſa</hi> goes out, or returns home;
'tis a Cry which one of his Retinue makes: upon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, to wiſh him either ſucceſs in his undertaking,
or a good Journey; and upon his return, to thank
God for his ſafe arrival. I omit a thouſand other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
and paſs on to the Relation of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
in the Year 1684.</p>

               <p>THE Succeſſes which the <hi>Germans</hi> met with in
the Campaign of 1683, open'd them a door
for carrying on conſiderable Enterpriſes; but at
the ſame time, they had expos'd <hi>Poland</hi> to the juſt
Reſentments of the Grand Signior, againſt whom
it had declar'd War, by an Irruption contrary to
Articles of the laſt Treaty, concluded at <hi>Jarawno,</hi>
between the two Armies. The Court of <hi>Vienna</hi>
profited very much by thoſe Advantages it had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
through the Aſſiſtance of its Allies, whilſt
the Republick of <hi>Poland</hi> was taking care to put its
Army into a poſture of preventing the <hi>Turks</hi> from
taking any Advantage of its weakneſs. The <hi>Turks</hi>

with a <hi>Seraſquier</hi> of Note, being the
Third <hi>Baſſa</hi> of thoſe which the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire
had left of them, that were reckon'd the ſtouteſt
Men. They had loſt ſeventeen of the beſt of 'em
the Year before, either by a Glorious Death, or by

and rais'd a Body of his Beſt Troops, to be
as a Supply to thoſe whom the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to beſiege; being not in a capacity of entring
upon the Offenſive this Year. The Council of
<hi>Vienna</hi> reſolv'd upon Aſſaulting <hi>Buda,</hi> leaving
<hi>Newhauſel</hi> behind them, knowing it would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of it ſelf, after the Taking of that Capital
City, from whence it had all its Supplies. For 'tis
to be obſerv'd, That notwithſtanding the Taking
of <hi>Barcan, Lewents,</hi> and <hi>Strigonium,</hi> yet the <hi>Turks</hi> had
free Communication between <hi>Newhauſel</hi> and <hi>Buda,</hi>
where they had a Bridge. The new <hi>Baſſas</hi> ſent to
<hi>Newhauſel</hi> in the Year 1684, arriv'd there without
any obſtruction; and the <hi>Bey,</hi> my Patron, went
once during the Winter to <hi>Buda,</hi> and return'd back
as eaſily, only making uſe of the Night, and the
Windings of the Mountains. Upon that occaſion
I had a Sight of that Famous City, which was the
beſt fortified of any in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and was rich, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
full of <hi>Jews</hi> and Merchants.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> after the Raiſing of the Siege of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> had put into the Place his Friend <hi>Cara Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemet
Pacha<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and appointed for his Aſſiſtant a Brave
Soldier, call'd by way of Exaggeration, <hi>The Devil;</hi>
his Name was indeed <hi>Chaitan Ibraham Pacha,</hi> as if
the firſt Word, which ſignifies <hi>Satan,</hi> was the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
of his Family.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> open'd the Campaign be-times,
and march'd directly to <hi>Strigonium,</hi> where
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54820:115"/>
his Bridge was laid: Part of his Army paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Newhauſel,</hi> a little on the Left, almoſt within
reach of their Cannon, and encamp'd three Days,
above, within ſight of the City; during which time
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſally'd out with all his Cavalry, to haraſs
the <hi>German</hi> Army; from whom they took a great
many Men and Women, with Proviſions in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
After this, the Army continu'd its March,
paſs'd the <hi>Danube,</hi> carry'd in a few Days two
ſtrong Places ſcituated upon the Hills on the
Right ſide of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> and afterwards went to
lay Siege to <hi>Buda.</hi> Whereas the Imperial Army
was not very numerous; it could not form any
large circumvallation, nor could it entirely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
the Place. There were great Intervals in
the Line, by which the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had ſeveral
Opportunities of throwing Men and Ammunition
into the City. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> aſſaulted firſt
the Lower Town, where he carry'd two very
large and well-guarded Trenches: He caus'd the
Town of <hi>Pest,</hi> on the other ſide the <hi>Danube,</hi> to be
carry'd by Storm, where he broke the Bridge of
the <hi>Turks,</hi> and left a ſmall Detachment to hinder
the entring in of any Succours, that might be
brought upon the River. He had the ſole conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of this very River, which might have
brought all neceſſary Proviſions into his Camp,
with Recruits and freſh Troops, without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being intercepted. Yet the <hi>Germans</hi> did
not either know how, or elſe could not take any
Advantage from that Conveniency; for the Army
wanted every thing at the end of the Siege; Bread
being as ſcarce with them, as in the beſieg'd City.
The Ammunition was ſcarcer, and I have heard
of very creditable Perſons, that they were forc'd
to eat Man's Fleſh, beſides that of Horſes.</p>
               <p>The Lower Town was taken in a ſhort time.
The D. of <hi>Lorrain</hi> continu'd his Aſſaults on the ſame
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54820:115"/>
ſide, to come up to the Wall of the Upper Town;
ſtretch'd (as I obſerv'd before) on the Edge of the
Hill, widen'd at each end, and fortify'd with
a double Retrenchment. That Prince omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might make himſelf Maſter of the Place,
no more than the <hi>Baſſa</hi> did to defend it. The <hi>Jews</hi>
ſerv'd him herein very zealouſly, puſh'd on with
a deſire of preſerving their Riches, which was as
dear to them as their Religion and Country. The
Supplies of Men and Proviſions, which he receiv'd
by ſeveral Repriſals, refreſh'd his Garriſon; and
beſides it was but faintly attack'd. They carry'd
their Works to the very bottom of the Wall, and
endeavour'd to undermine it in two ſeveral Places,
and the Mine that was made at one of the round
Towers, was charg'd three times together to make
a Breach. The <hi>Turks</hi> countermin'd it, and the
firſt time took the Powder out of it; the ſecond,
had no effect; and at laſt, when it was blown up,
it threw it towards the City, inſtead of throwing
it into the Trench, and ſo fortify'd the place on
that ſide. They were no more ſucceſsful in other
parts: The Aſſaults were frequent, but always
repuls'd with Vigour. The Artillery play'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
but without ſucceſs; and they caſt in not
above three or four Bombs in a Night. In a word,
they ſpent three whole Months together before
this City, without being able to make the leaſt
Lodgment upon it; and they ruin'd the <hi>Imperial</hi>
Army, which loſt near 28000 Men, among whom
are reckon'd 500 of the Braveſt <hi>German</hi> Officers.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> arriv'd at the Camp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of <hi>September,</hi> with his Troops, and
took his Poſt on the Right of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army,
over againſt the Palace of King <hi>Matthias,</hi> which is
the Point oppoſite to that which had been attack'd.
The Council of War, held after his coming, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to carry on a freſh Aſſault on that ſide, as
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54820:116"/>
being the moſt eaſie to batter and force. The
Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſent before-hand a Trumpeter
to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to ſummons him to ſurrender. The
<hi>Baſſa</hi> admitted the Trumpeter into the City,
hearken'd calmly to his Propoſal; told him, That
he underſtood of that Prince's Arrival, and had
not fail'd to have beaten any one, but himſelf, by
Cannon-ſhot, from an Eminence, where he was
one Day poſted, to take a View of the City: but
that he was willing to ſpare him, and had that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
for his Perſon. Afterwards the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
order'd him to be ſhewn the Place, and an inner In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment,
which render'd it ſtronger than at
the beginning of the Siege. He ſhew'd him his
Magazines, furniſh'd with Proviſions and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,
for above ſix Months longer; and his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
ſtanding to their Arms, being very Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and very Reſolute. After this, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ask'd
him, upon what account he was oblig'd to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render;
and then diſmiſs'd him, with a Preſent of
20 Ducats of Gold.</p>
               <p>The Siege therefore continu'd with freſh Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
and new Attempts. In the mean time, the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> made his Advantage of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
beſieging that City. He had plac'd Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Cavalry, for half a League round his
Town, and went often to viſit them. Every Week
he went out in Parties, ſometimes towards <hi>Lewents,</hi>
another time towards <hi>Komorne,</hi> and then towards
the River <hi>Wag,</hi> to <hi>Goutta,</hi> to <hi>Nitria,</hi> and to all the
Parts round about his Government, to ſeek for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
and never return'd empty-handed: So
that he preſerv'd his own Stores, and ſupply'd the
City very plentifully, with the Spoils he took in
the Enemy's Country. Twice or thrice he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
towards <hi>Buda,</hi> to get Intelligence of the
Siege. One Day he entred at Noon into the Iſle
of <hi>Schut,</hi> and ravag'd the Borders of it. In a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54820:116"/>
word, this indefatigable Man, made as good a
Campaign as could have been imagin'd, whilſt the
<hi>Germans</hi> periſh'd with Miſery under the Walls of
<hi>Buda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he went out of the City, the Second
<hi>Baſſa</hi> commanded in his Abſence, and never fail'd
of coming to compliment him upon his Return,
with an extraordinary ſubmiſſion: It was then
that he open'd all the Avenues, and brought plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all things into <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> which before was
under a kind of Blockade, and ſo quite chang'd
the Face of Affairs in that City, from what it was
in his Predeceſſor's Time.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of theſe Tranſactions, his <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Majeſty, inform'd by Count <hi>Teckley</hi> of the Arrival
of this <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and of the Friendſhip there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> then priſoner
at <hi>Leopold;</hi> he oblig'd the <hi>Viſier</hi> to write to his
Friend of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> concerning my Exchange with
the 30 <hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Zetzen.</hi> This Letter and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
were ſent to Prince <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> who ſerv'd
with his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Regiment in the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, at
the Siege of <hi>Buda.</hi> He had a Commiſſion of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two Men more for my particular Ranſom; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thoſe that were detain'd at <hi>Tranſchyn,</hi> were
only ſtopp'd by way of Repriſal, for my former
Patron's Breach of Faith. The Prince ſent an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
to <hi>Komorne</hi> with all theſe Diſpatches, and a
Letter which he wrote to me. From <hi>Komorne</hi> to
<hi>Newhauſel</hi> a Correſpondence was ſettl'd, as if it
were in time of Peace; the Peaſants on both ſides,
went and came by an Eſtabliſh'd Cuſtom. The
ſame thing was allow'd to the Slaves of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who left a Comrade as Hoſtage in the City,
where they were attended by ſome honeſt Man,
ſtill wearing Shackles on one Leg. Without this it
would have been impoſſible to have concluded upon
any Exchange, or to have negotiated for any Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:54820:117"/>
The <hi>Hungarian</hi> Governour of <hi>Komorne,</hi> nam'd
<hi>Zamori George,</hi> according to the Cuſtom of that
Country of putting the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> after the Sirname:
this Governour, I ſay, ſent by Prince <hi>Lubomirski</hi>'s
Order a Peaſant to <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> with the New
Propoſals of the King of <hi>Poland.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who
never heard of my Name, inform'd himſelf by the
old Officers, who the <hi>Frenchman</hi> was that the King
of <hi>Poland</hi> demanded, and who was his Maſter.
He afterwards ſent a <hi>Chaous</hi> to the Quarters of the
<hi>Bey,</hi> the Eldeſt Son of his Predeceſſor; which
<hi>Chaous</hi> came to call me in the Kitchin, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to follow him, without asking any
Leave of my Maſter, or ſo much as letting me go
to ſpeak to him. In the way he inform'd me of the
Propoſals that were arriv'd, and the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of accepting them. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> examin'd me
very mildly about my Quality, about the Refuſal
which his Predeceſſor made of Releaſing me, and
what the Pretences and Excuſes were, that he had
alledg'd for ſo doing. What I anſwer'd him was
confirm'd to him by <hi>Muſtapha-Aga,</hi> who had taken
me. The time of my Enlargement being now
come, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> conſented to the Exchange, and
demanded for the two Men that were offer'd him,
two <hi>Spahas</hi> of his Acquaintance priſoners in <hi>Poland</hi>
call'd <hi>Alé Spaha,</hi> and <hi>Mehemet Spaha.</hi> Upon this,
the Meſſenger was ſent back with the Anſwers;
and from that time the <hi>Baſſa</hi> kept me at his own
Houſe, ſending one of his Men to fetch my Rug
and my Knap ſack, from the old Patron's Cook,
without any other Formality. I never far'd better
than I did this Day. All the <hi>Turks</hi> of the Houſhold,
being newly come from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they
had been us'd to Civility, gave me Bread, Meat,
and ſome ſmall pieces of Money. At Night they
brought me into an old ruinous Building poſſeſs'd
by a great many Soldiers, <hi>Spahas</hi> or <hi>Janizaries,</hi> of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54820:117"/>
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Race, very ſociable Perſons, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me civilly; eſpecially thoſe with whom I
was acquainted in the former <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Houſe, who
waited for an Opportunity of being convey'd back
to the <hi>Levant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Morrow, an <hi>Aga</hi> took and carry'd me
before the <hi>Cadis,</hi> or Judge of the Town; before
whom they had ſummon'd the <hi>Boy,</hi> my Maſter, to
conſent to my being made free, by vertue of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Exchange offer'd to the <hi>Baſſa.</hi> That <hi>Bey</hi>
ſent thither his two Brothers, who diſputed a long
time about the Reparation, that ought in juſtice
to be made for a Slave, for whom they ſaid they
might have 5000 Crowns at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The
<hi>Cadis</hi> took my Name, and continued writing in his
Regiſter: but they would by no means conſent to
the Manumiſſion, and ſo went away without ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. Notwithſtanding this, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> continu'd
his Reſolution, and detaining me at his Houſe, lie
the next Day ſent theſe three <hi>Beys</hi> away, with all
their Family to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> He committed me
to the care of his Valets de Chambre, who were ſix
young <hi>Levantines,</hi> well ſhap'd, and lodging all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
who were allow'd four diſhes at a Meal
out of their Maſter's Kitchin; and they always
left me enough, with Bread that I had every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
hot out of the Oven; for a comfortable Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.
The <hi>Turks</hi> do not bake as we do; they
make thick Cakes, rather than Loaves, and bake
every Day, according to the number of the People
among which they are to be diſtributed. But
that which reſtor'd me perfectly to my former
Health, were the Melons and Ice. I have already
obſerv'd, That the Melons of <hi>Hungary</hi> are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
good. There are whole Fields full of
'em round about <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> from whence they
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54820:118"/>
bring ten Cartloads a Day into the City: beſides
which, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> orders a ſmall Cart of 'em to be
brought every Day after Dinner, for the uſe of
his Family, out of his own Private-Garden, which
he cultivated very carefully, and caus'd to be
watch'd every Night by one of his Men, in their
Turn. Out of this Cart, thirty are pick'd out for
his own Table, the reſt fell to the ſhare of the
Footmen and Slaves: So that I did eat 10 or 12
a Day, like ſo many Apples. I drank Water, and
Water-Ic'd; for the <hi>Turks</hi> have no other way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment,
than to put large pieces of Ice into a
Pitcher full of Water, whoſe Mouth is ſtopp'd
with another Iſicle, that drops into the Water by
little and little, and of this they drink.</p>
               <p>I began to feel my ſelf in a comfortable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which increas'd upon the hopes of ſeeing a
ſpeedy end put to my Miſery. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> order'd
a Cloth Coat, two Shirts, and a Cap to be given
me; and charg'd his Valets de Chambre, not to
put me upon waiting: ſo that they would not let
me ſo much as carry the Diſhes to the Kitchin,
for fear the Patron ſhould chance to meet me.
He being a Man of Courage, and deſirous of being
better inſtructed, took an occaſion by my ſtay, of
informing himſelf of all things that I was able to
give him an account of, both with reſpect to the
Countries, and to the Courts of Princes. I then
took Notice, That the Grand Viſier's Deſign was,
after the taking of <hi>Vienna,</hi> to fall into <hi>Bohemia:</hi> All
the Queſtions of this <hi>Baſſa</hi> were about the City of
<hi>Prague;</hi> what Paſſes, Cities and Rivers lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween:
He enquir'd likewiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very much about the
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and his Family. In a word, all
that could be of any Service to him, he made the
ſubject of our Conferences, which were held al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54820:118"/>
every Night after Supper, in the preſence
of two or three of the Principal Officers of the
Cavalry, and the Curate of the <hi>Moſque,</hi> whom he
very highly eſteem'd, inviting him every Night
to Supper. The more I advanc'd in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language, the more he lik'd
my Company, and the greater was his care of me.
He ask'd, Whether I had Bread enough allow'd me
by his Steward, and upon my Reply, order'd me
two Loaves a Day: But the Valet de Chambre,
whoſe Buſineſs it was to diſtribute the Bread to
the reſt, kept back the Moiety for his own uſe;
and his Knavery being found out by the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> he
commanded an hundred Blows to be given him
upon the Soles of his Feet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have ſeveral ſorts of Coyn, beginning
with the Ducats, or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Sequins, call'd <hi>Altom.</hi>
The Crowns of every Country are of the common
Value: In the Levant they are call'd Piaſtres, in
<hi>Hungary</hi> Rixdollars, and of theſe they make up
the Purſes, which contain 500 each. This is their
peculiar way of reckoning conſiderable Sums, as
they do by Aſpres, in the ordinary courſe of Trade.
Beſides the Crowns, they have Lion-dollars, of a
leſs value, call'd ſimply <hi>Cara-groch,</hi> made almoſt like
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Crowns, with a great Lion on one ſide.
There are a great many of theſe Pieces in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> becauſe all the Commerce of <hi>Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi>
and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> through thoſe Provinces
that ly between the <hi>Nieſter</hi> and the <hi>Danube,</hi> is
carry'd on by Lion-dollars. At <hi>Newhauſel</hi> they
have ſmall Silver Pieces of the Emperor's Coyn,
worth 5 <hi>German</hi> Groats, or 10 <hi>French</hi> Sous, ſtamp'd
with the Arms of the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> on one ſide,
and on the reverſe with a <hi>Noſtre-dame</hi> encircl'd
with Rays. The Tinfes of <hi>Poland</hi> of the ſame Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54820:119"/>
are likewiſe currant here: And the ſmalleſt
Coyn us'd in Domeſtick Affairs, were the <hi>Para,</hi>
and the <hi>Atché.</hi> The firſt of theſe are very thin,
and of very fine Silver, about the bigneſs of a <hi>French</hi>
Denier, having ſeveral <hi>Arabic</hi> Characters on them:
48 or 50 of them go for a Crown, and 40 for a
Lion-dollar. The <hi>Atché</hi> is the ſmalleſt Coyn the
<hi>Turks</hi> have, which yet is worth about 4 <hi>French</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiers;
and with theſe Pieces they pay off the Troops,
and go to Market; it ſounding big to hear them prize
ſuch or ſuch a Commodity, at 4 or 500 <hi>Atchés</hi> or
<hi>Aſpres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, Prince <hi>Lubomirski</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
our Anſwers, diſpatch'd them away to the
King of <hi>Poland;</hi> who ſent him back an Order to
take out of the Priſons of <hi>Tranſchyn,</hi> the 28 <hi>Turks</hi>
which had been ſent thither by way of Repriſal.
This ſpun out a long time, by reaſon of the great
Diſtance there was betwixt <hi>Buda</hi> and the <hi>Nieſter,</hi>
where the King of <hi>Poland</hi> then was: it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
protracted by the Knavery of a Secretary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Prince <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> who inſtead of
going to fetch the Slaves, ſtay'd at <hi>Niklitsbourg,</hi>
where he conſum'd the Money that had been given
him, and a thouſand Crowns that he had borrow'd
in his Maſter's Name. So that after two Months
waiting for News from him, they were forc'd to
ſend another Meſſenger, who brought the <hi>Turks</hi>
at laſt, about the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> to <hi>Komorne.</hi>
At their Arrival, two of the Chief of them came
to <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> to caſt themſelves at the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Feet;
and to beg for my Liberty, and their own. This
Man affected with their Misfortune, and deſiring
to render a conſiderable Service to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,
in delivering ſuch Brave Soldiers, was at
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54820:119"/>
firſt for frightning them, by telling them, That
they muſt make him amends for the Ranſom he was
like to loſe for me. Theſe unfortunate Creatures
repreſented to him, That they could give him but
little ſatisfaction at preſent, being ſo long priſoners:
but aſſur'd him, that they would make him an ample
Return as ſoon as they ſhould get into their own
Country. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſmil'd; and commanding
their Fetters immediately to be knock'd off, which
they had always wore to this time, told them very
freely, that he did not pretend to exact an <hi>Aſpre</hi>
of them, thinking himſelf ſufficiently happy in
being able to do that piece of Service to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,
and the <hi>Sultan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was afterwards call'd into his Chamber: He told
me, That indeed the <hi>Turks</hi> retain'd at <hi>Tranſchyn</hi>
were arriv'd, but that there were ſtill wanting two
more, that were propos'd for my perſonal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.
I reply'd, That they could not as yet be
brought from <hi>Poland,</hi> or that they might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
without ſending them ſo far into <hi>Hungary,</hi>
by the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Caminiec.</hi> Upon this Overture,
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> reflecting upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Country, and willing beſides to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
his Generoſity and Confidence, told me, that
he would truſt to my Word without waiting for
any farther News, and would remit me upon the
Promiſe, which I made him, of immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
the two <hi>Spahi</hi> of his acquaintance, ſpecify'd
in our Letters. I gave him a Note under my Hand
for it, writ in <hi>Latin;</hi> to which, for want of a Seal,
I clapp'd my Five Fingers. And here 'tis to be
noted, That all the <hi>Turks</hi> wear a Ring, engrav'd
with <hi>Arabic</hi> Characters, which they make their
Seal, making the Impreſſion of it in a Letter or a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54820:120"/>
Deed, by the ſide of the Superſcription, to atteſt
the Truth, and Validity of the Contents. Beſides
this Note, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> made me ſwear to the ſame
thing upon my Prayer-Book: and theſe Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
I ratify'd to him by an honourable Promiſe
of Returning back to <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> in caſe theſe two
Men were not ſet at Liberty. In purſuance to this,
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> order'd my Fetters to be knock'd off; for
you muſt take Notice, That the <hi>Bey,</hi> the <hi>Kiayia</hi> of
his deceas'd Father, who had taken them off at firſt
by his own Authority, put them upon me again two
Months after the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Death, in order to oblige
me to be more urgent for my Ranſom.</p>
               <p>There was nothing now more to do, than to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a day with the Governour of <hi>Komorne,</hi> and the
Officer who had brought the <hi>Turks</hi> from <hi>Tranſchyn,</hi>
to make our Exchange in the open Field. They ſent
on each ſide Paſports, and they agree'd to have 30
Men of a Side, and the Place they fix'd on, was to be
not far from the <hi>Danube,</hi> near the Village of <hi>SanPetré.</hi>
But the Execution of it was put off to the 14th of
<hi>November,</hi> through two Scruples of Intereſt, that
were as Unintelligible as Unreaſonable. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of Prince <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> to whom ſeveral <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Slaves had writ during the Goings and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Expreſs from <hi>Komorne</hi> to <hi>Newhauſel,</hi>
thought of delivering two or three others, with
my eight and twenty <hi>Turks;</hi> pretending that this
Number was too extravagant for a ſingle Man. It
was to no purpoſe for me to write that his <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Majeſty detain'd 'em only upon my account; That
zealous Patriot was harden'd to this Project; and
I believe he would have ſtopp'd the Exchange, had
he not receiv'd freſh Orders from <hi>Vienna,</hi> whither
Prince <hi>Lubomirski</hi> was return'd, being wounded in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54820:120"/>
the Camp before <hi>Buda.</hi> The King of <hi>Poland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tir'd with the Delay, redoubled his Inſtances;
and that Lord did the ſame to his Envoy, with
Orders at the ſame time, to give two of his own
Priſoners, which he had at <hi>Komorne,</hi> in caſe that
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> made any Scruple upon the
two <hi>Spahis,</hi> that had not yet been ſent.</p>
               <p>The other Pretenſion was ſtarted by the Keeper
of the Priſons of <hi>Komorne,</hi> nam'd <hi>Lasko.</hi> That
covetous Officer was for exacting of thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Turks</hi> the Fees of the Priſon, ſettled on both
ſides at a Ducat a Head; as if for fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Day's ſtay in his Priſon by chance, for want
of a more ſecure Place, they ought to have pay'd
a Fee, which the Governor of <hi>Tranſchyn</hi> never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of them. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the Pretenſion of <hi>Lasko</hi> to be very unjuſt,
and appear'd very much concern'd to me; and the
more becauſe for one Ducat that he might demand
of me, he muſt give 28 for theſe unhappy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who had nothing in the World. However,
he very generouſly compleated his Deſign, and
pay'd the whole Fees; ſo boundleſs were his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Intentions. This Noble <hi>Baſſa,</hi> whom I ſhall
never forget, loaded me with Favours upon my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture;
gave me a Coat, and Money to buy me
what I wanted beſides at <hi>Komorne.</hi> He intruſted me
with more, to ſend him ſeveral Toys and Tobacco
from thence; embrac'd me very joyfully and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately,
and order'd me to be conducted to
the Place of <hi>Rendezvous,</hi> by a Colonel of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Cavalry, with thirty of the Beſt Horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to his Garriſon or Houſhold, my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mounted on one of his <hi>Arabian</hi> Horſes, of
which he had thirty very Rich Ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:54820:121"/>
The Exchange was made with all the Fairneſs
and Honor imaginable. We arriv'd the firſt at
the <hi>Rendezvous.</hi> Prince <hi>Lubomirski</hi>'s Officer put
his <hi>Turks</hi> into a large Boat, with thirty Foot Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as a Guard, allow'd him by <hi>Zamori George</hi>
Governor of <hi>Komorne,</hi> and paſs'd the <hi>Danube</hi> over
againſt <hi>San-Petré.</hi> When he ſaw this Body of
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cavalry, having as many Led-horſes as
there were Men, he fear'd ſome Foul-play; he
therefore put his Priſoners into the Thickets, and
plac'd his Foot in a Covert way before his Boat,
to ſecure a Retreat, in caſe of any accident. But
<hi>Maiar-Alay-Bey,</hi> who commanded that Troop
of Horſe, order'd them to alight, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
himſelf to diſſipate the Fears of the <hi>Pole. Lasko</hi>
advanced likewiſe towards <hi>Alay-Bey,</hi> whom he
knew particularly. They ſat down on the Graſs,
and entred into a Friendly Conference, which
laſted a quarter of an Hour. At laſt <hi>Alay-Bey</hi>
ſeeing his Countrymen in Chains coming out of
the Buſhes, for whom he had provided ſeveral
Waggons; he took me by the Hand, and gave
me to <hi>Lasko</hi> and the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Officer, aſſuring them
over and over, That I was the King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s
<hi>French</hi> Gentleman. Each Party took their Leaves,
and went on his own Way. The Footmen march'd
in good Order towards the Boat; <hi>Alay-Bey</hi> caus'd
the Prieſt, or <hi>Otgé</hi> of <hi>Zetzen,</hi> (who was one of
the <hi>Turks</hi> that had been detain'd, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommended to him by the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſel</hi>)
to get upon the Horſe that brought me
thither. He doubtleſs was very glad to ſee his
Brethren arrive, as I was to ſee once more <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morne,</hi>
and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Country, where I took up
my Lodging for that Night.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:54820:121"/>
On the Morrow, I punctually diſcharg'd the
Commiſſions of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and laid out all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
he gave me in ſmall Toys, which I preſented
to my Good Friends of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> of whom I
receiv'd a thouſand Tokens of Friendſhip at the
latter end of my Slavery; and whom I would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have ſeen again, had not the <hi>Imperialists</hi>
beſieg'd that Place the next Year. They broke up
the Siege of <hi>Buda</hi> at the ſame time. The very day
of my Departure, part of the Army paſs'd the
Bridge of <hi>Barcan,</hi> in order to encamp on the Plains,
between that Fort and <hi>Newhauſel.</hi> The Elector of
<hi>Bavaria</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Komorne,</hi> juſt as I got on Shore,
and was receiv'd under the Diſcharge of all the
Artillery of the Citadel; which I took at firſt for
a Rejoycing for the Taking of <hi>Buda.</hi> On the
Morrow I waited upon that Prince, and the Duke
of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to recommend to them the <hi>German</hi>
Slaves which I had left behind me in Chains.
Beſides, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had given me in charge, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in his Name, a general Diſcharge of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
of both Nations, Head for Head, wiſely
foreſeeing that he ſhould want Men; and chuſing
rather to ſpend his Proviſions on <hi>Turks,</hi> who were
of uſe to him, than on Slaves, that were only a
Burden.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſufficiently commend the Vigilance
and Bravery of this Officer; nor his Conduct and
Skill in matters of War. He was better vers'd
in Fortifications, than the moſt Skilful of his own
Nation. <hi>Newhauſel</hi> had ſeveral Defects in the
Fortification, which lay on the ſide of the <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morne</hi>
Gate, by which it was attack'd. That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
diſcover'd them, and order'd them to be
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54820:122"/>
repair'd, in opening the Angles, enlarging the
Breaſt-works, and ſtrengthening with Faſcines
the back Part of the Open Curtains. He made
all his Cavalry march out one Day, to cut
down a large Thicket, which lay about a League
off the City, over againſt <hi>Goutta.</hi> Another time
he carry'd off all the Wood of the Neighbouring
Villages, depriving the Enemy by that means, in
caſe of a Siege, of that Supply with which he
furniſh'd his Garriſon.</p>
               <p>I was very ſorry to hear of the Loſs of that Brave
Man; tho' I was the cauſe of his being beſieg'd:
For upon the Report I made to the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
of the ſtate of that Place, in the preſence of
the Pope's <hi>Nuncio Palavicini;</hi> and his acquainting
his Holineſs with it; It was reſolv'd upon at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi>
through his Sollicitations, to beſtow the
next Campaign on that Undertaking. For which
purpoſe, General <hi>Heyſeler</hi> was detach'd, with a
Body of Troops this Winter, to block up the
Place, and to prevent them from receiving any
Supplies from Abroad. But this Blockade did
not hinder the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> from making
Sallies upon the <hi>German</hi> Quarters. The <hi>Germans</hi>
had during Summer taken a Town nam'd <hi>Schoran,</hi>
a League off that City; from whence the <hi>Turks</hi>
had been forc'd to withdraw. They afterwards
made ſome Proviſions at <hi>Nitra,</hi> in Preparation for
the intended Siege. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> after my Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
retook <hi>Schoran,</hi> and went to burn upon the
River of <hi>Nitra,</hi> at the very Gates of that City,
the Boats which the <hi>Germans</hi> had caus'd to fall
down with Proviſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:54820:122"/>
Theſe were the Tranſactions of <hi>Hungary</hi> this
Campaign: The King of <hi>Poland</hi> on his ſide did all
he could, to oppoſe the Incurſion of the <hi>Turks</hi> and
<hi>Tartars,</hi> commanded by the <hi>Seraſquier Suleyman
Pacha,</hi> who was advanc'd as far as the <hi>Nieſter;</hi>
and by this march croſs'd the Deſigns of the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
who had Thoughts of entring into <hi>Valachia,</hi>
and by the Way of <hi>Boudziac,</hi> to have pierc'd as far
as the Black Sea.</p>
               <p>The Court remov'd from <hi>Cracow</hi> at the end of
<hi>March</hi> 1684, and had gain'd the Frontiers towards
<hi>Leopold,</hi> to be in a Readineſs for any Enterpriſe.
Whilſt the King waited at <hi>Yavorouf</hi> for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of his Troops and Recruits, Count <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuculli</hi>
arriv'd there, being ſent by the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> to Compliment his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty, upon the
happy Succeſs of the preceding Campaign. The
Emperor ſent thither the Count of <hi>Valeſtein,</hi> as his
Ambaſſador Extraordinary, with Order to follow
the King and his Army, whitherſoever they mov'd.
Laſtly, the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> being willing to
enter into a League againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and to take
Advantage of theſe Favourable Junctures, nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
the Procurator <hi>Moroſini,</hi> to go into <hi>Poland</hi>
with that Character, who likewiſe made the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
with his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> open'd it, by ſpoiling two
or three Retreats, which the <hi>Turks</hi> had preſerv'd
on this ſide <hi>Caminiec,</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Podolia</hi>
and <hi>Ruſſia:</hi> The neareſt, that lay towards this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City, was the Caſtle of <hi>Yaſlovietz,</hi> ſcituated
on a Hill, ſurrounded with others more large, and
almoſt encompaſs'd with a River, which waſh'd
the Bottom. There was an <hi>Aga,</hi> with a Garriſon
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54820:123"/>
of about 120 Men, detach'd from <hi>Caminiec;</hi> ſome
ſmall Pieces of Artillery, and Fortifications pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable.
The Army encamp'd on the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies
which commanded that Caſtle, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
the <hi>Aga</hi> to ſurrender. The <hi>Aga</hi> deſir'd for
his Honor's ſake, to ſee ſome Cannon play upon
the Place; it being pretty ſtrong by its Scituation,
and by its ancient Walls. <hi>M. Dupont,</hi> Engineer
to the Republick, caus'd two Batteries to be rais'd,
which Beat down all the Front of the Caſtle, which
fac'd the Army. They had ſcarce fir'd ten times,
when the Garriſon deſir'd to march out. The
<hi>Aga,</hi> being well acquainted with the Cuſtoms of
his own Country, which reckons no Man inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
that is unfortunate, was not for expoſing
himſelf to the Teſt; and ſo retir'd into <hi>Poland,</hi>
where the Queen made him Keeper of one of her
Country Houſes. His Lieutenant likewiſe ſtay'd
with the King, and ſerv'd him as an <hi>Huſſar,</hi> and
their <hi>Janizaries,</hi> were diſpers'd here and there
about the Country.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aga</hi> is a Man of a good Mein, and a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Aſpect, of a Warlike Air, even a little rough,
which Adverſity ſmooth'd afterwards. The other
is a mere Soldier, very Fat, of a Low but Brave
Mein, as appear'd by thoſe dreadful Scars with
which he was full; eſpecially that which he
brought from <hi>Candy,</hi> by a Bullet ſhot into the back
part of his Head.</p>
               <p>The Surrender of this ſmall Caſtle, made juſt
as I have deſcrib'd it, did however inhance the
the Reputation of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Arms in Foreign
Parts. They talk'd as big in <hi>France</hi> of this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as of the Taking of <hi>Valenciennes:</hi> ſo true
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54820:123"/>
is it, That Fame raiſes Matter of Fact in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Diſtance of the Climates, where they
are done. The ſame News being brought to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſel,</hi>
chear'd up the Hearts of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Slaves ſo
much, that I believ'd it had been <hi>Caminiec</hi> that was
taken by the King. And my ſuppoſition was the
more probable, becauſe I knew that the Republick
had undertaken the War, only with Intention of
retaking that Place from the <hi>Turks;</hi> being the moſt
conſiderable which they held in <hi>Poland.</hi> But my
News-monger <hi>Suleyman,</hi> the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Coffee-man,
undeceiv'd me, and told me the truth of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
               <p>The Queen attended the King as far as <hi>Yaſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vietz,</hi>
and was preſent with her Court at the
Aſſault of that Place, which in truth deſerv'd no
other than an Army of Females. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who
march'd out, were very much ſurpriz'd, having
never before ſeen ſuch Luggage follow the Camp.
But the Queen, after this Exploit, retir'd to <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold,</hi>
from thence to <hi>Yaroſlave.</hi> The King march'd
directly to <hi>Zwaniec,</hi> there to paſs the <hi>Nieſter.</hi> His
Deſign was to enter into <hi>Valachia,</hi> to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Maſter of that Province, and there to winter
his Army, in order to cut off the Communication
between <hi>Caminiec</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> who had no other
way thither, no more than the <hi>Tartars.</hi> By
this means that place would have been immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
block'd up, and reduc'd at laſt, for want of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
to ſurrender within ſix Months, without ſo
much as diſcharging a Cannon. Beſides, the King
of <hi>Poland</hi> made a conſiderable Diverſion to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Taking of <hi>Buda</hi> by the <hi>Germans,</hi> and to
relieve one another from the <hi>Nieſter</hi> to the <hi>Danube.</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:54820:124"/>
But neither were the <hi>Germans</hi> minded to ſhare the
Glory, and the Fruits of their Conqueſts with the
<hi>Poles,</hi> nor were the <hi>Poles</hi> in a capacity of finiſhing
this great Deſign. They could not in 3 Week's
Time ſo much as lay the Foundations of a Bridge,
having neither Boats, nor other things neceſſary.
And after they had ſpent above a Month's Time,
in caſting Baskets of Stones, Faſcines, and other
Materials in the Water, an Inundation of the River,
occaſion'd by the Rains that fell, carry'd away all
the Work.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, the <hi>Tartars</hi>
appear'd on the other ſide the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of near 40000 Horſe, from whence every Day
Detachments were ſent out, who ſwam over the
River, a little below the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Camp, between <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim</hi>
and <hi>Caminiec,</hi> and came to skirmiſh with the
<hi>Poles,</hi> who likewiſe croſs'd the River ſometimes
with the ſame Vigour; ſo that all was reduc'd into
particular Skirmiſhes, the two Armies looking on
at the ſame time, and diſputing for the Ground
and Forrage, at the Expence of ſome unhappy
Creatures, whom the <hi>Tartars</hi> carry'd off every
Day. There were likewiſe ſeveral Interviews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Officers of the two Armies, having the
River in the midſt. The Chancellor of the <hi>Cham,</hi>
who had formerly been at the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Court, to
treat about ranſoming his Brother, came one Day
on the Bank of the River, and deſir'd to ſpeak with
one of the King's <hi>Touariches,</hi> who accordingly
was order'd thither: He deſir'd them to tell his
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he deſir'd to ſee him, to thank
him again, for all the Favours he had formerly
ſhewn him. The King was very glad of that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54820:124"/>
and order'd this Anſwer to be given to
the <hi>Tartars,</hi> That if he would come into the Camp,
he would ſend him not only a Convoy, but Hoſtages.
This Gentleman very frankly reply'd, That his
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty did him wrong to think that he
forgot, that his ſingle Word was more worth,
than all the Hoſtages of the Army; and that he
would come to him on the Morrow upon his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role.</hi>
But he could not execute his Deſign, becauſe
the Enemy decamp'd.</p>
               <p>To enter into the the Particulars of this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
which in general paſs'd without any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Action: You muſt know that the King
of <hi>Poland,</hi> in Decamping from <hi>Yaſlovietz</hi> to march
towards the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> committed the Van-guard to
be led by the Caſtellan of <hi>Cracow,</hi> Little General
of the Crown, with fifty Troops all Horſe, <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars,
Pancernes,</hi> and <hi>Valachians,</hi> who had Orders
to advance as far as <hi>Caminiec,</hi> to take a View of
the adjacent Places, to obſerve the Motions of the
Garriſon, and the Marches of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Caſtellan was to amuſe the Enemy, and to
cover the the March of the Army, as well as the
Deſign of the Bridge. He ſtay'd for ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that City, where his <hi>Huſſars</hi> march'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to skirmiſh with the <hi>Turks,</hi> who made ſmall
Sallies on the <hi>Poliſh</hi> detachment. In the mean
time the King poſted himſelf at <hi>Zwaniec</hi> on the
Banks of the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> where he had his Right
Wing, ſtretch'd out a little beyond that Caſtle
towards <hi>Caminiec,</hi> which was not above two
Leagues lower, and on the ſame ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:54820:125"/>
To cover the Building of the Bridge that he
was willing to make in that place, he ſent over
on the other ſide the River, all the Dragoons,
and ſome Troops of <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Valachians,</hi> part
in Barges, part ſwam over, and the reſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it a little above the Camp, where was a
ſmall Iſland.</p>
               <p>Theſe Troops were retrench'd on the other
Bank, and remain'd there a long time, but the
<hi>Tartars</hi> having haraſs'd them ſeveral times, by the
ſmall Attacks which the <hi>Poles</hi> bore with great
conſtancy, and the Rains having ruin'd their
Bridge, the King order'd them to repaſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
intending to march towards <hi>Caminiec.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was joyn'd before by a Body of Troops,
which the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> had ſent to
the Republick, as his Quota, conſiſting of two
Regiments of Infantry, the one commanded by
Prince <hi>Alexander Cowrland,</hi> the other by the
Count of <hi>Dona,</hi> with a Regiment of Dragoons;
the whole under the Command of General <hi>Troucz,</hi>
which compos'd about 2000 Men.</p>
               <p>Whereas the <hi>Tartars</hi> came frequently into the
Camp, and ſtay'd there without being diſcover'd,
one could not be ſecure from them. The Equipage
of theſe <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Troops was all carry'd
off the firſt Night, which oblig'd the King of
<hi>Poland</hi> to order all the <hi>Poles</hi> to wear a white
Handkerchief, twiſted round their Left Arm,
to diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who were
always mix'd in the Camp, and at Forraging, with
the Valets of the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:54820:125"/>
The Army then decamped from <hi>Jouanietz,</hi> after
having tarried above three Weeks to no purpoſe,
having known that the Tartars had been joined by
the <hi>Seraſquier,</hi> with a great Body of Turks, which
the common Report of the Camp gave out to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to forty thouſand Men, but which in effect
was not above ten thouſand. The Enemy paſſed
on our ſide, at firſt by Detachments of three or
four hundred Horſe, who approaching the Poliſh
Camp amuſed their Troops by frequent Skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
carried off the detached Parties, who
were ordered to patrol along the River to ſecure its
Banks, and by this means deprived the Poliſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the Knowledge of their Motions: In fine,
all theirs had paſſed without being diſcovered, they
having no need of a Bridge for that end, &amp; carrying
neither Artillery nor Equipages with them.</p>
               <p>The better to judge of this Action, we muſt note,
that <hi>Jouanietz</hi> is an Ancient Caſtle of Stone-Work,
but very much ſhattered, ſcituated upon a riſing
Ground, about one hundred and fifty or two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Paces from the <hi>Dnieſter,</hi> which is very rapid
at that Flace and almoſt as broad as the <hi>Seine</hi> at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
but not ſo deep by much, with ſteep Banks, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with thick Buſhes. This Caſtle is inhabited
by ſome Families of Valachians, of the Number
of thoſe who retired into <hi>Poland,</hi> by whom
certain Places of theſe Frontiers of <hi>PODOLIA</hi>
have been peopled. Over-againſt this on the
other ſide of the River, but a little lower, towards
<hi>Caminieck,</hi> is that of <hi>Cotchym.</hi> This is much of the
ſame Structure, pretty good and Maſſive, but
much ruined. There was heretofore a Bridge
which ſaved ſome of thoſe that fled at the Battle
of <hi>Cotchym</hi> when the Turks, who were encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
at this Place, were defeated. This Bridge
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:54820:126"/>
at that time fell down by the Numbers of Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
that crowded over it, was afterwards rebuilt
and broke down again, taken and retaken by both
Parties. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> deſigning to march
into <hi>Wallachia,</hi> had poſted himſelf under <hi>Jouani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etz,</hi>
which he left behind his Camp, taking up all
the Ground between that Caſtle and the River.
The Tartars advanced to <hi>Cotchym,</hi> and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
roamed a long time on its Banks, as I have
ſaid, ſwam over the <hi>Dnieſter</hi> a little below that
Caſtle, but very ſecretly, to keep the Poliſh Army
on their own Country, and to divert them from
their deſign againſt <hi>Walachia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> having by this means miſs'd
his Aim, formed another Project, which was to
draw the Tartars to a Battle, in ſome diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Place. He was forced to move cunningly
from Poſt to Poſt as at a Game at Cheſs. The King
went directly to <hi>Caminieck,</hi> advanced upon the Hills
near that Place, from whence he ſaw into the very
ſtreets, and tarryed there ſome time, by way of
<hi>Bravado,</hi> within Cannon-ſhot, above 500 of which
they ſhot from their Platforms and Towers, the
Pieces of a middle-ſize or bore, carrying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his Army. After which he left that Place
on his his left Hand, marching as if he deſigned
to return into <hi>Poland,</hi> and moving from the <hi>Dnie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
which was behind him. The Tattars follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame way, and daily preſented themſelves
either upon their Flanks, Front or Rear.—In
fine, the King poſted himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Ruins of a demoliſhed Town, where there
were ſtill ſome Walls, with the Terraſſes of an
old Caſtle, which was raſed, on which he plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Standard. This Place was in a Bottom, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
by ſteep Hills and a River. The Lithuanian
Army ſtayed at the top, and the Tartars being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by this Lure, ruſht into this Bottom. The
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54820:126"/>
KING ſeeing them thus enſnared, according to
his Deſire, rejoyced to have catched his Prey in a
Trap, and would have given them Battle, and the
rather becauſe the Tartars muſt ſuffer in retiring
precipitately from this Cut-throat Place, flanked
by the Polanders; But the Generals oppoſed
the ſame, alledging the Approach of the Night
and Fatigue of a long March; hiding under thoſe
ſeeming Reaſons a ſpiteful Jealouſie of the K's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whoſe Name would have ſwallowed every thing
as at <hi>Vienna,</hi> without leaving any ſhare of the
Succeſs to the Generals. They propoſed a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of War: But the King ſaw into their Hearts,
and reproaching them with this Averſion for the
Publick Good, which they made to give Place to
a ſecret Partiality for a Politic Intereſt, he retir'd
to his own Quarters, full of a juſt Indignation,
and mortal Anger againſt thoſe Enemies of their
Country, which at this Juncture loſt ſuch an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
as they could never get ſince. In a
word, the Tartars, being ſenſible of the diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſneſs
of the Poſt, retired, and appeared not
again in two Days after. Thus ended this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,
called in <hi>Poland, The Campagne of Jou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anietz,</hi>
which decided nothing on either ſide; only
the Enemy drew this Advantage from it, that they
hindred the King of <hi>Poland</hi> from entring into <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachia,</hi>
as the Grand Viſier on his ſide, had fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Projects of the Germans under the Walls
of <hi>Buda.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was ſo obſtinately
bent upon that Siege, that after he had retired
with his Army, it was given out in Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
That he carried on the Siege. The Count <hi>de
VValeſteine,</hi> Imperial Ambaſſador to the King
of <hi>Poland,</hi> maintained a long time, That they had
only ſent away the Sick and Wounded, to <hi>Comorra</hi>
and <hi>Raab:</hi> But when I arrived at <hi>Zolkiew,</hi> where
the Court was the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:54820:127"/>
them of this Error, by aſſuring them that
I had ſeen the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and Elector of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi>
the ſame Day I came out of Slavery, who
were actually retired from before <hi>Buda,</hi> and had
been purſued a great way, in their Retreat,
by the Turks of the Gariſon, who very much
gall'd the Imperial Army, which was weary and
worn out, by the Labours of a long Siege.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> having retired much about
the ſame time, Procurator <hi>Moroſini</hi> the Venetian
Ambaſſador, having diſpatched his Affairs, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Home, leaving his Secretary called <hi>Alberti,</hi> as
Reſident at this Court, during all this War, into
which the Republick had juſt ingaged themſelves.
This <hi>Alberti</hi> was ten Years in the ſame Station at
the Court of <hi>England,</hi> a Man of wit, cunning
and ſly after his ſmooth-way, falſly ſimple, ſober,
ſecret, ſpeaking little, and communicating himſelf
leſs, prying into another's Affairs, as it were out
of Complaiſance, but in order to draw ſome Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
therefrom, ſuch as <hi>Juvenal</hi> mentions to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
by thoſe Greeks newly arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
patronized by the Grandees, whom they found
the Secret, to make them ſtand in awe of them,
by the knowledge they had of the Affairs of their
Familys. <hi>Alberti</hi> arrived ſome time after the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
having loſt all his Equipage by Fire
near <hi>Cracow.</hi>—A little Compaſſion at
firſt aſſiſted him at Entry into <hi>Poland.</hi> His Modeſty,
his Submiſſions, managed with Addreſs, without
ſtooping too low or being too ſtarch'd, his Aſſiduity in
giving his Attendance even at Hours when he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not, his Inventive Genius, for certain little
Mechanick Works, gave him all the facility ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to compaſs his Ends. The King was very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
full of Queſtions, and much addicted
to learned Converſations of all ſorts; ſo that he
muſt have ſuch a Man as <hi>Aeſop</hi> to anſwer every
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54820:127"/>
thing. Secretary <hi>Alberti</hi> was capable enough in
ſome Reſpects to act that Part.</p>
               <p>He was back'd by another hidden and ſecret
Miniſter, near the King's Perſon, from the Court
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who arrived in <hi>Poland</hi> much about the
ſame time, in a Jewiſh Habit, and under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Title of <hi>a deputed Miſſionary into</hi> Muſcovy,
<hi>for reuniting the Ruſſian Schiſmaticks.</hi> 'Tis the
famous Father <hi>Vota,</hi> a Savoyard by Birth, Auſtrian
by Inclination and by Profeſſion a great Talker, but
ſpeaking well: A Courtier, educated in the
fine Politicks of <hi>Italy,</hi> and brought up to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
of the Cloſet, as well for managing of
Sovereign Princes, as Republicks, whoſe Intereſt
and Deſigns he knows better than any Man. He
has, with his great Experience, a lively, piercing and
clear Wit, an admirable Memory, furniſhed
with all that is moſt rare and moſt particular in
Ancient and Modern Hiſtories, with all that is
moſt exact in Chronology, and with a true Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy
of all the great Families of <hi>Europe,</hi> a great
Divine, an excellent Geographer; and, in a
Word, <hi>an Univerſal Man.</hi> He utters himſelf in
Latin, French and Italian, with equal Facility, is
dextrous to divert a nice Queſtion, and to prevent
before he anſwer him who propoſes it, by flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Inſinuations in his favour, by way of doubting
it, and to make the Diſcourſe fall on other common
Places, from which he alſo diverts the Queſtions,
inſomuch that he ſtuns him, is before-hand with
every Body, and appears in every thing to be the
Champion, ſpeaking always without giving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
a Minutes time to reply; for he neither
blows his Noſe, ſpits nor coughs. Juſt like a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
that goes only the length of its Spring; for
when he once enters upon any Subject, he never
ceaſeth ſo long as he has Auditors; he is a News-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
beyond compare, who values not to whom he
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:54820:128"/>
diſtributes his Gazettes. I have ſeen him buſie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
on Politicks, and the Accidents of War, with
Footboys and poor Women, and expoſe himſelf
thereby on the uſual Days, to be teazed by all
the Footboys of the Court, by all the Underlings
of the Kitchin, and by all the Curious Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
which he valued as an eſſential Thing. He
had the Fault that is annexed to the Caſſock of
the Society, to love above all things the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of great Men, Honours, Diſtinctions, the
firſt Place in Illuſtrious Companies, the Carreſſes
and Civilities of Crowned Heads. Furthermore,
he was a Man of good Manners, ſober, ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf many Days with leſs than was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
eating only in Company, and ſitting down
at Table meerly for Diſcourſe ſake; inſomuch that
he never thought himſelf more welcome than
when People hearkened to him. Upon which the
Marq. <hi>d'Arquyan,</hi> methinks made a very good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
when he ſaid of Father <hi>Vota: That he had a
particular Advantage, to cauſe Digeſtion in eating
by the Interval of his Diſcourſes.</hi> This famous
Man is alſo very Religious, fearing God, devout
without Bigottry, rigid without Scruples, ſimple
without Affectation, void of all wordly vanities,
and a truly honeſt Man.</p>
               <p>The Emperor could not have made a better
Choice for the deſign he had to induce the King
of <hi>Poland</hi> to ingage in the League. He knew that
that Monarch loved the ſoft Amuſements of wit,
Knowledge and the Intrigues of the Republick of
Letters; that he muſt have a <hi>Breaſt-Plate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,</hi>
a <hi>Scavantas</hi> to the utmoſt; but at the
ſame time a SPIRIT, that was Plyable,
Subject, bearing Reproaches, Injuries, unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
times, Labour and the Troubles of this Life.
This Jeſuit was born with all theſe things; I have
ſeen him him a hundred times upon the Floor of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54820:128"/>
an Anti-Chamber, that he might not miſs his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of conferring with the King. By this
means he made himſelf uſeful; inſomuch that that
Monarch could have no peace, if he had not Spoken
with him. He had a Hand in all Nice Affairs,
and became the only Channel through which
the Nuncio's of the Pope and the Miniſters of the
Emperor arrived at the Cabinet of his Poliſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and he became Maſter of all Secrets and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
               <p>The Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> would have made him
Preceptor to the King of the Romans, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he was very capable of the ſame, not only upon
Account of his profound Knowledge without Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry,
but alſo of his Noble Education and
high elevated Thoughts: But at the ſame time
'twas thought they had occaſion for him in more
important Affairs, which was to keep the
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who was very much moved with
the frightful Ingratitude of the Germans, in
their Intereſt. They ſent him through <hi>Moſcovy,</hi>
under Pretence of a Miſſionary to the Schiſmatick
Ruſſians. He went thither with the old Baron
<hi>Joroſski,</hi> whom the Emperor ſent to the Czar the
beginning of the Year 1684. to ſound that
Prince in favour of the Holy League, in order
by that means to give the Crim Tartars a powerful
Diverſion. Upon their return, Father <hi>Vota</hi> ſtopt
in <hi>Poland,</hi> to wait there for a more favourable
Conjuncture to his pious Deſign, giving out that
the Czar had not hearkened to his firſt Overtures.
The King received him very pleaſantly (all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties
are pleaſing to the Learned, and above all
at this Court, where every thing runs in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
as the Heat and the Cold) he carried him to
the War, lodged him, defrayed him, and at laſt
made him his moſt intimate Secretary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:54820:129"/>
Much about the time of the arrival of all thoſe
Perſons extraordinary, each in his Sphere, arrived
alſo one from <hi>France,</hi> no leſs illuſtrious,
diſtinguiſhed, beſides his Perſonal Merit, by his
great Birth. 'Twas the Marquis <hi>de Bethune,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
Ambaſſador Extraordinary of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
who returned thither without any other
Character than that of Brother-in-Law to the
Queen, and without any other Deſign than to
follow the King into the Army, being out of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in <hi>France,</hi> where the Peace had juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
the new Differences between the two
Nations, after the taking of <hi>Luxemberg,</hi> in the
Year 1684. which the Marſhal <hi>de Crequi</hi> joined
that very Year to the Conqueſts of <hi>Louis le
Grand.</hi> The Auſtrian Miniſters being naturally
ſuſpicious, according to the Genius of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
believed that the Voyage of the Marquis
<hi>de Bethune</hi> comprehended ſome Politick Myſtery.
Count <hi>Walleſtein</hi> dropt ſome Words to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in a Conference with the Marquis <hi>d'Arquyan;</hi>
who telling him one Day that he, Count <hi>Walle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi>
would doubtleſs be glad to ſee a Lord in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
whom he had known at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with his Friendſhip; that Miniſter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
ſmiling, That he had rather ſee him elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
but the Marquis <hi>d'Arquyan</hi> replying, That
his arrival was without Myſtery, and only upon
the Score of a Relation, who came to ſee the
King his Brother-in-Law, after the happy Succeſs
of his Campagnes; the Count <hi>de Walleſteine</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
with the ſame Tone, <hi>That the Pretence of
his coming was very plauſible, and the Colour well
contrived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, all thoſe illuſtrious Perſons lived in
this Court in a perfect Union of Civility and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Correſpondence. There had not been ſo great
a Number of Foreign Grandees at that Court of a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:54820:129"/>
long time: The end of the Campagne alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
it more with Officers of the Elector of
<hi>Brandenburg</hi>'s Troops: Beſides the young Prince
of <hi>Courland;</hi> his Brother Prince <hi>Ferdinand</hi> alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
thither from <hi>Germany</hi> to get ſome Poſt in
the Army; The Rendezvouz of thoſe illuſtrious
Perſons was in the Houſe of the Marquis <hi>d'Arquin,</hi>
who kept an excellent Table, and made a Figure
worthy of the high Rank of <hi>Father to a great
Queen.</hi> They played a great Game there all the
Winter, whilſt the King of <hi>Poland</hi> was taken up
about calling of the General Diet, whoſe Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
happened in the following Year 1685. It
ought to have been held in <hi>Lithuania,</hi> as being
the third, according to the Regulations made for
that purpoſe; however, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> with
the Advice of moſt of the Senators, aſſembled
them at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> on the ſixteenth of <hi>February,</hi>
1685. to ſave the Nobility the Trouble of a
long Journey, after ſo tedious a Campagn, and
that they ſhould not be at ſo great a diſtance,
from the Frontiers, to the end that they might
be in a readineſs to repair thither betimes upon
all Occaſions.</p>
               <p>This raiſed great Difficulties in the Republick,
by the obſtinacy of the Lithuanians, as we
ſhall ſee in the Second Part of theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs.
In the interim, Count <hi>Walleſtein</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Vienna,</hi> leaving the Care of Affairs to
a Reſident called <hi>Chemoski,</hi> a Relation of the
Baron <hi>Jarowski,</hi> who came afterwards and took
it upon himſelf. Secretary <hi>Alberti</hi> fixed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
alſo in this Court, and Father <hi>Vota</hi> began
his Intrigues in favour of the Confederate
Princes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:54820:130"/>
This was the Face of the Court and of the
Affairs of <hi>Poland,</hi> when I arrived there after
I came out of Slavery. The Officer that Pr.
<hi>Lubomirski</hi> had ſent to <hi>Comorra</hi> to make the
Exchange, conducted me to <hi>Presburg</hi> by the
Iſle of <hi>Schit,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Vienna.</hi> I
found the Country Peopled with new Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
who were rebuilding the Villages; and
the Flying Bridge of the firſt of thoſe Towns,
was re-eſtabliſhed. I tarried in the other five or ſix
Days, with my Deliverer, who filled up the
Meaſure of his Kindneſſes to me, by ſolid
and effectual Services, my Acknowledgment
wherof, can never be ſufficiently teſtified.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that without the preſſing Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations
of the Marquis <hi>d'Arquin</hi> the Queen's
Father, and without the Interceſſion of Prince
<hi>Lubomirski,</hi> who negotiated my Liberty at his
own Charge (which coſt him above 400 Piſtols,
whereof the Court of <hi>Poland,</hi> repaid him nothing,
and of which he would not ſuffer me to reimburſe
the leaſt Penny) without theſe two Lords, I ſay, I
had been killed at <hi>Nehauſel,</hi> either by Famine or
by Arms; for that Place having been beſieged
ſix Months after, there was only found therein
about 40 or 50 Slaves, of nigh 1400, that I left
in the Place, as well in the Priſons as in private
Houſes, the reſt having been killed upon the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
and in the Breach where the Baſſa's expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them to work, to cover the Turkiſh Soldiers.
The Germans alſo maſſacred a great Number of
them in the general Storm, without diſtinguiſhing
them from the Enemy in the heat of the Conflict.
At this Rate my Deliverance coſt nothing to the
King nor Queen of <hi>Poland,</hi> all the Charge of it
fell on Pr. <hi>Lubomirski.</hi> Indeed the King had a great
deal of Trouble to find the two <hi>Spahi</hi>'s demanded
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:54820:130"/>
by the Baſſa: He called <hi>Mehemet</hi> was found
with a Polander, of whom his Majeſty bought
him, to put him into the Hands of the Marquis
<hi>d'Arquin:</hi> The other, who was called <hi>Ali Spaha,</hi>
could not obtain the ſame Liberty; <hi>Miogenski</hi>
who had him in Cuſtody, refuſed to releaſe him.
The firſt had all reaſon imaginable to praiſe his
Bondage, not only becauſe of the good Treatment,
that he received in the Houſe of the Queen's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but alſo becauſe of the fair Dealing that
was obſerved for his Intereſt: I had been exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with 28 Turks of <hi>Zetchin,</hi> and had ſignified
it ſo from <hi>Vienna,</hi> without ſpecifying any thing of
the Conditions I had ſworn to: Upon the firſt
News the Marquis <hi>d'Arquin,</hi> not knowing what I
had promiſed, thought to procure me an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by cauſing this <hi>Mehemet</hi> to ran ſome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
it being ſaid that the French Man, for
whom he was deſigned to be exchanged, had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his Liberty by other means. The <hi>Spahi</hi>
offered 500 Crowns; and a Turkiſh Envoy who
was detained at <hi>Leopold</hi> by way of Reprizal for
him of <hi>Poland</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> paid the ſame:
After which he retired to <hi>Caminiec,</hi> with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
Security and Conveniency. At my arrival
the Marquis <hi>d'Arquin</hi> preſented me with that
Summ; but I explained to him the Circumſtances
of my exchange; and thanking him for his good
Will, I convinced him that I ought to reſtore that
Money to <hi>Mehemet Spaha,</hi> as I afterwards did.</p>
               <p>I departed by Poſt from <hi>Vienna,</hi> and arrived at
<hi>Cracow;</hi> where a Canon, Chancellor to the Prince
of <hi>Poland,</hi> a Man of great Merit and ſweet Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
kept me three Days, and treated me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably;
after which I reached <hi>Reetchouf,</hi> a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
belonging to Prince <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> the Podſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſta
or Captain whereof gave me a Calaſh,
which brought me to <hi>Yaroſlave;</hi> and there I found
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54820:131"/>
the Equipages of the Queen's Father, with one of
his Gentlemen, who brought me in three Stages
to <hi>Zolkief,</hi> where the Court was. 'Tis eleven
great Leagues from <hi>Yaroſlave</hi> in a ſtraight Line,
leaving <hi>Yarvorouf</hi> on the Right. I had found at
<hi>Przevorska,</hi> a City belonging to the great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal
of the Crown, Prince <hi>Staniſlas Lubomirski,</hi>
about two Leagues above <hi>Yaroſlave,</hi> the Troops of
the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> which two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries
of the Republick were conducting to the
Frontiers of the two Eſtates; and this was the
only Rencounter worthy of Remark for me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Kindneſſes ſhown me by the Officers;
and above all the General, who made me a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of a Caſe of Piſtols, of great Price, which
I beſtowed as a ſmall Mark of my Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Pr. <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> who liked them ſo well
that he has always worn them ſince out of his
Goodneſs, and by an obliging Diſtinction, which
heaps further Obligations upon thoſe I owe him
already.</p>

               <p>I Had reſolved to ſend away my Family, but
juſt as they were ready to imbark, a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

me, That on <hi>July</hi> 18. M. <hi>du Quene,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored
at the Mouth of the Harbour of <hi>Scio,</hi> with
ſix Men of War and a Fire-Ship; and that after
a very ſhort Negotiation to oblige the Governour
of the Caſtle to turn out ſome Tripolins, who had
ſheltered themſelves under his Canon, he fired ſo
furiouſly for 4 Hours together, that he ſhattered
them. The Caſtle alſo fired ſome Guns, to which
M. <hi>du Quene</hi> anſwered; Some Houſes were da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged,
many Tripolins killed, as alſo ſeveral
Turks of the Town, and ſome Moſques were pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
through in many Places.</p>

This Action has cauſed great Commotions at the
Port; ſeveral Councils have been held, to which
the Mufti and all other great Officers were called.
Janiſaries were ſent to the Caſtle of the <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelles;</hi>
Couriers were ſent to ſeveral Places.
The Captain Baſſa had Orders ſent him to return
into Port as ſoon as poſſible with the Gallies.
The Conſternation they were in, cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;
Some were of Opinion to arreſt me,
and ſome Officers adviſed more rigorouſly: They
threatned to hang me, and all the French with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Dominions. They ſent to <hi>Scio</hi> for the
particulars of the Damages, and of the Enterprize.
I have Notice given me that I ſhall be called
to Audience, I ſhall perpaps ſpeak as I ought, and
I have good Reaſons to alledge which are drawn
from the expreſs Terms of the Capitulations. I
have ſupported the Affair hitherto without inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and I hope that notwithſtanding all this
terrible Image of Preparations to deſtroy all, I
ſhall terminate the Matter to the Glory of the
King.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, Sir, you may find ſomething of a Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigners
Security in what I wrote to you: But, in
fine it is good to act with cold Blood. The Turks
fancy that the King inclines to declare War with
them: I aſſure them, that his Majeſty will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Ancient Alliance, if the Port is diſpoſed
thereto, and that he has no other deſign than
againſt Rovers and the Rebel Subjects of the Grand
Senior, who ought not to be received into his
Ports. The Affair of the Moſques does above all
things vex the Muſſul-Men, who are extreamly
bigotted to their Religion, and to every thing that
relates to it externally. I tell them, That ſome
chance ſhot might have done them ſome damage,
but that if the French had done it deſignedly, the
Diſorder would have been much greater. It is alſo
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:54820:133"/>
true, that M. <hi>du Quêne</hi> had no Deſign to ſhoot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Moſques, and that he thought only of
battering the 7 Tripolin Veſſels. I ſtill hope
notwithſtanding their Menaces that my Family may
depart in 8 Days time, and that my Reaſons will
be heard.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IT is proper to inform you, Sir, That the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Piracies of the Tripolins, have obliged
the King to ſend a Squadron of Men of War into
thoſe Seas, under the command of M. <hi>du Queſne,</hi>
with orders to attack thoſe Robbers, even in the
Harbours of the Grand Senior. M. <hi>du Quêne</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored
the 23d of <hi>July</hi> in the Mouth of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
of <hi>Scio:</hi> Having known that eight Tripolin
Ships were there, he ſignified to him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Fortreſs of the Grand Senior, that
he came as a Friend, and that the Emperor of <hi>France</hi>
was an Ancient Allie of the Emperor of the
Turks: But that he had expreſs Orders to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
the Pirates, who by the Terms of the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation
were called <hi>Rebel Subjects,</hi> and abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Vengeance of our Emperor. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
gave no Anſwer. The Tripolins were very
numerous. They had made themſelves Maſters of
the Town and Harbour. M. <hi>du Quêne</hi> after having
tarried<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in vain for an Anſwer, let fly his Cannon
among them. He ſhattered the Tripolin Ships,
ſeveral chance Shot damaged the Houſes and
Moſques, and killed 200 of the Inhabitants. The
Fortreſs fired upon the King's Ships; they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and beat down a part of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:54820:134"/>
This News cauſed a great Commotion at the
Port: I acquainted them that the Difference was
only with the Tripolins: That the Emperor, my
Maſter deſigned to entertain an Amity between the
two Empires: That the Men of War had done
nothing contrary to the Capitulation: That if
they ſhould do the leaſt hurt to a French Man,
it would be taken as a Declaration of War, the
Conſequences whereof would be terrible; and
that there was no Appearance that the Grand
Senior would break a Peace, which has been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
eſtabliſhed between the two Empires, to
ſupport Robbers.</p>
               <p>Several Councils have been daily held: Orders
were given to augment the Gariſons of all Places
of Strength: Such great Commotions were never
ſeen, nor ſuch an Alarm. In fine, after having
done all things poſſible, in vain, God be thanked,
to frighten me, I was called ſome Days ago,
to an Audience of the Viſier's Deputy. Our
Converſation laſted an Hour and an half. He
talked to me of the unheard of Temerity of this
enterprize; and of the extream Anger of the
Grand Senior; and at laſt told me, That he gave
me Notice as a Friend, that perhaps I might be
ſo happy as to buy off my own and the Blood of
the French for a great Summ of Money. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him, I was as ſecure at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as
at <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe his Emperor was juſt, and mine
very potent: That I would not give one Denier
towards repairing the Damages ſuſtained at <hi>Scio:</hi>
That it was the Tripolins part to pay it. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſeveral things, which certainly the Turkiſh
Miniſter had never heard before. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and Tone, wherewith I pronounced them,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54820:134"/>
were <hi>a la Gaſcogne:</hi> I ſpoke of all that the
Emperor of <hi>France,</hi> would do in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
if he were exaſperated; and I concluded
with telling him, That if the French were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
to the Grand Senior or the Viſier, I would
carry them all back into <hi>France,</hi> where they
would ſoon forget <hi>Turkey.</hi> The Deputy
treated me very civilly. He told me, That he
exhorted my Prudence to take other Reſolutions,
and went immediately after to give the Viſier an
Account of our Conferences, being much ſurprized
at my ſtedfaſtneſs.</p>
               <p>I do not know what will become of this Affair, I
ſhall certainly ſupport it to the end, nay, to the laſt
extremity. M. <hi>du Quêne</hi> is ſtill before <hi>Scio,</hi> where
the Tripolins deſign to refit. They have done no
ſort of Violence, nor made no Threats to any
French Man. 'Tis certain, that if ſuch a like
thing had happened to any other Nation, it
would have been the utter ruine of them. I was
told about ſix Days ago, That they expected
News of the Captain Baſſa, who is to go to
<hi>Scio</hi> with the Grand Senior's Gallies. I wait
the Conſequences, and the Succeſs of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
with M. <hi>du Queſne,</hi> with impatience.</p>

               <p>I received, with a due Reſpect, the Letters
which your Majeſty was pleaſed to do me the
honour to tranſmit to me; dated the 25th Inſt.
And from them I underſtood how much your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Royal Mind is moved, to accelerate the
Succour of the City of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and how much
inclined to the Defence of the Chriſtian Empire,
and Auſtrian Territories: Of which, indeed, I have
been always ſo much perſwaded, that in relation
hereunto, I have received, from your Majeſty's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
nothing new, nor what I did not before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
In the mean time, I eſteem it a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and honour to me, that your Majeſty does
not vouchſafe to truſt to your own moſt prudent
Judgment in theſe things that are ſtill to be done.
I have hitherto indeavoured to guard my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Watchfulneſs of the Enemy by the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of my incampments; which though indeed
I did not look upon as walled about, yet I have
thought them to be as good as ſuch from the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of the Rivers and the diſpoſition of the
Ground they take up. I have provided for the
Security of the Bridge of <hi>Crems,</hi> and am adviſing
the building of a ſecond about <hi>Tulm,</hi> a Place
nearer to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and which is reckoned to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.
That which is hardeſt to me is, that I can
ſcare ſend any Perſon into the Town; nor on the
other hand, receive any News from the beſieged. But
ſeeing I underſtand, from the magnificent Marſhal
of the Court of the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> that the
particular Relations of what things are acted in
the Imperial Army, do not diſpleaſe your Majeſty,

I have communicated ſomething to your Majeſty

by Prince <hi>Lubomirski</hi> and his Poliſh Officers
and Soldiers alone, moſt prudently, valiantly, and
with the natural Vigor of the renowned Poliſh

               <p>THE Turks having opened their Trenches on
the 14th inſtant before <hi>Vienna,</hi> pretty near
the City; from the 16th they advanced their
Works to within 60 Paces of the Counterſcarp,
and took Poſt in an Iſland of the <hi>Danube</hi> over-againſt
<hi>Vienna,</hi> called <hi>Tabor;</hi> from whence I
was obliged to retire. I would willingly have
kept that Poſt, to have had Communication with
the City; but this Iſland extending about two
Leagues, and the Arm of the <hi>Danube</hi> which runs
near the City being almoſt fordable every where;
and the Squadrons and the Infantry being able to
paſs in Battalia in many Places of the Fords, the
Banks on that ſide where the Turkiſh Camp was,
being raiſed, and their Cannon commanding the
whole Iſland, even to the Bridges; which being
broke down by their Artillery, there was no other
retreat left me, but the City, or to ſwim over
the <hi>Danube,</hi> which were two Extremities equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dangerous: And though the Bridges had been
covered, it was in <hi>Teckley</hi>'s power to come and
poſt himſelf at the end on this ſide, I remained in
the Iſland without Forrage and Subſiſtance; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that that Poſt not being tenable, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
with Cavalry alone, having been obliged
to put the Infantry into the City to defend it, I
thought that I was obliged to paſs the <hi>Danube</hi> with
the Imperial Cavalry, in order to preſerve them
for their relief. The Communication being thus
cut off, we have had no News of them ſince the
22d. when the Enemy had advanced their Works
to the Paliſſado's, which the beſieged defended with
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54820:136"/>
dint of Sword; They extended their Works to
the Right and Left, and had already made them
reach three Points of the Counterſcarpe. They
had not yet begun to batter the Walls, and had
only 10 or 12 great Pieces of Cannon mounted in
Battery.</p>
               <p>Having received Advice of the Auxiliaries of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by the Count <hi>de la Tour,</hi> I endeavored to
ſend ſome Perſons into the Town to acquaint the
Governor therewith; but I have as yet no Advice
of their being got in; not having received any
Letters from the City, nor ſeen any of the Signals
by which I had ordered them to let me know that
they had received my Letters. The Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the City is the more difficult that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
they have poſted Watches at every ten
Paces diſtance. Juſt now we hear their Cannon
battering the Place, though from the Report there
appears not to be 20 or 25 Pieces of great
Cannon.</p>
               <p>On the 25th Inſtant, having had Advice that
the Rebels advanced, and that they burnt all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Morave:</hi> I reſolved to march to the
River <hi>Mark,</hi> which is pretty good, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
firſt given Orders to the Imperial Troops
that are in <hi>Stiria</hi> to advance into the Mountains, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
inacceſſible Places, and endeavour to incommode
the Forages of the Turks. I gave Orders to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Dunewald,</hi> who covers <hi>Upper Auſtria</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Saint Peld,</hi> to aſſemble all the Peaſants, and
to poſt them in the Woods for the ſame purpoſe.
I ſent General <hi>Leſſie</hi> to <hi>Crems,</hi> to wait for the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varians
that ought to be arrived there by this time,
and to keep the Bridge. I left in the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Bridges of <hi>Vienna,</hi> two Regiments
to hinder the Turks from paſſing on this ſide by
Boats, and to endeavour as much as poſſible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
News to the City, and to receive, Advice
from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:54820:137"/>
Upon my arrival on the River <hi>Mark,</hi> I had Ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vice,
that <hi>Presburg</hi> had deſired <hi>Teckley</hi>'s Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and taken in a Gariſon of the Rebels:
That he was marching with his Hungarians, and
the Baſſa's of <hi>Agria</hi> and <hi>Waradin,</hi> with Artillery
to ſtorm the Caſtle; That the Grand Viſier had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the City to make a Bridge of Boats, with all
Diligence: And that he had already ſent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
from his Army, to join <hi>Tekey</hi> by means
of the Bridge that was making at <hi>Presburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thought my ſelf obliged, upon thoſe Advices, to
attempt the breaking thoſe Meaſures; ſince if
they ſucceeded, not only the Countries of <hi>Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
Moravia</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> were unavoidably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to Fire and Sword; but beſides this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of the Enemies two Armies ſeemed
ſo dangerous to me, that I had reaſon to fear they
might force me to retire to <hi>Crems;</hi> cut off my
Communication with the Army of <hi>Poland;</hi> bring
up their Bridges as far as <hi>Vienna,</hi> and render it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to ſuccour the Town; for the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
might make very great Detachments from his
Cavalry, which being joined to the Body of the
Rebels, that was marching towards this ſide of the
<hi>Danube<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> might poſt themſelves every where and
withſtand the ſuccours from <hi>Poland,</hi> or at leaſt
keep them further off.</p>
               <p>So that I determined to paſs the <hi>Mark,</hi> to
put ſome more Foot into the Caſtle of <hi>Presburg,</hi>
and to deſtroy all the Materials which that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal
Town was preparing for a Bridge to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
I left the Infantry and the Baggage in
<hi>Mayerek,</hi> and began to paſs the River with the
Cavalry about three in the Afternoon at two Fords.
I marched on the 28th all Night and ſtopt at a
Defile about half a League from the Town, having
ſent ſome Dragoons before, backed by Polanders,
to poſſeſs themſelves of the Hill of the Vineyards,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:54820:137"/>
within Muſquet-ſhot of the Town, that the Foot
might march with ſafety. The Dragoons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſecured the ſaid Hills, I cauſed the Infantry
to march into the Caſtle; and having been told,
That the Fire in the Enemy's Camp was feen
within a quarter of a League of the Town, I
thought my ſelf obligd' to ſummons it the better to
deſtroy the Preparations of the Turks for the
Bridge; not doubting but that, ſeeing the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
in the Caſtle, and the Emperor's Army in a
Condition to deſtroy them, it would ſurrender,
which is did at firſt ſummons, delaying only ſo
long as was requiſite to ſave the Gariſon of the
Rebels, to the number of three hundred, who
fled in Diſorder to their Camp.</p>
               <p>This Facility perſwaded me that there was
ſome Weakneſs in the Enterprize of the Enemy,
who had put themſelves in Battalia ſo ſoon as they
perceived me, without offering to advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Town; and this face of Affairs made
me reſolve to march towards them. I cauſed the
Dragoons immediately to poſſeſs 'emſelves of the
Vineyards, Hedges and Places that were covered
with Trees, that I might draw up the Cavalry in
Battalia behind them; which was done in four
Lines, the Ground allowing it.</p>
               <p>As the Lines were formed, I made them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to give Ground to others. At firſt the
Turks began to skirmiſh, which I hindered that
I might not ingage before I was in Battalia: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
formed, I made them advance towards the
Enemy, <hi>who immediately retired ſomething back to
a ſort of a covered Place,</hi> where I believed the
Body of their Army, and their Infantry might be.
And continuing to march, I ſaw them retreat
ſoon after; which obliged me to purſue them;
and to give Orders to Prince <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach
Part of his Polanders to ingage them. They
follow'd them with ſo much vigor, that the Turks and 
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54820:138"/>
Rebels, who fled with as much Precipitation and
Confuſion, were obliged ſome of them to betake
themſelves to ſwim in the Arm of the <hi>Danube,</hi>
which forms the Iſle of <hi>Schit;</hi> others fled into
the Woods, and the Body towards <hi>Tyrnau,</hi> without
having ever faced about, but at a little paſs
which they abandoned immediately. I cauſed all
the reſt of the Polanders to advance, to back the
firſt; and afterwards all the Imperial Dragoons
to advance into theſe Poſts, where the Turks
made ſhow as if they had a deſign to turn into.</p>
               <p>The Diſorder of the Turks was ſo great that
they were purſued near to <hi>Tyrnau;</hi> their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
taken; and ſix or ſeven hundred Men killed,
without the loſs of one Man on our ſide.</p>
               <p>Seeing them thus flying, and my Cavalry
fatigued enough, and not able to come up with
them; I recalled the Polanders; not being
willing to ſuffer them to purſue them too far
without being at hand to ſecond them; however,
ſome purſued them even almoſt to the very
Walls of <hi>Tyrnau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I encamped them afterwards near the City in
the Camp of the Turks; who I heard were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to <hi>Schintaw;</hi> and having refreſhed themſelves
a little there, retired further towards <hi>Lewens</hi> and
<hi>Newhauſel;</hi> they and the Rebels having ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
being diſſatisfied with each other.</p>
               <p>All the Cavalry of the Emperor was marching
to the Engagement with ſtedfaſtneſs and joy: But
the whole Action was done by the Polanders alone,
who left nothing for the Germans to do. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſufficiently praiſe the Conſtancy, Vigor and
Conduct of Prince <hi>Lubomirski;</hi> and of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Soldiers of the Body which he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:54820:138"/>
All the Priſoners and Deſerters ſay, that <hi>Tekeli</hi>
had retired the Night before with the Canon, and
the Infantry, and that there was a Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
between him and the Turks. They talk
variouſly of their ſtrength, ſome making them
amount to 60000 Men, others to 40000, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to 25000. But from their Incampment, I
cannot gueſs that they could be above 16 or
18000 Men.</p>
               <p>I hope this Action ſecures <hi>Presburg</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
and will cut off the Communication which
I apprehended with ſo much reaſon; That the
Rebels will not eaſily preſent themſelves before
this Army; That <hi>Teckley</hi>'s Troops will be deſerted
by a great Number of Hungarians, who will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
him, and that the Miſunderſtanding between
him and the two Baſſa's will not be diſadvantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, after having ruined every
thing that might ſerve to make Bridges; I thought
it adviſable to rejoin the Infantry and the Bagage;
and to put my ſelf within reach to cover the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of the Succours from <hi>Poland,</hi> and to haſten
the others.</p>
               <p>The News I have of them are; that the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varians
ought to be arrived near to <hi>Krems,</hi>
where I believe there may be 15 or 16000 Foot,
as well Bavarians as Imperialiſts, within theſe
few Days. I believe that the Troops of <hi>Saxony</hi>
and <hi>Franconia</hi> are upon their march; and I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
them as much as I can: I cannot deny but
that I very much doubt the holding out of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna;</hi>
for though I may very well hope, that
it is ſtrong enough with a good Gariſon and
good Troops; yet the forwardneſs of the Enemies
Approaches; and the Accidents that may Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
a Confuſion in a City that did not expect to

               <p>THE Count <hi>de Caraffa,</hi> General of the Battle,
ſet out Yeſterday, in order to go to the
King: I have given him Charge of a Letter for
your Excellency; wherein I ſignified to you that
the Counterſcarp of <hi>Vienna</hi> was, after having held
out twenty three Days, taken by the Turks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Covert of three great heaps of Earth,
which they had caſt up to clear three Points; from
whence they entred into the covered way: And
after having lodged themſelves there, they applied
themſelves to the Deſcent of the Ditch which
they ſounded on the 8th of this Month. Altho'
the Gariſon chaſed them them thence with loſs,
yet the Enemy had time to fix their Miners to the
Ravelins, which they blew up on the 12th, and
there aſſaulted the Place. They were repulſed;
inſomuch that they think of nothing but mining,
and blowing up the Baſtions which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack.
Your Excellency who knows what it is
for Places to be beſieged, may judge of the
State of <hi>Vienna;</hi> which the Turks think fit now
only to attack by Mines; and as they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in the Ditch, you may eaſily comprehend
the Danger, and the Importance of not looſing one
Minute of coming to the Succour of a Place
which is of ſo great Moment to the common
Cauſe; and to all Chriſtendom. I have given
your Excellency all theſe Particulars, becauſe that
knowing how much you underſtand the State of
all things, I ſhould have done an Injury to your
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54820:140"/>
Merit and Zeal, if I did not tell you the true
State of the Beſieged, and the Importance of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening
to their Aſſiſtance. I pray the King to
ſuccour us; his preſence alone is worth an Army;
ſo I beg him to advance his march with the firſt
Troops: By the ſame reaſon, I pray your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
to haſten your march to join me. I ſhould

I promiſe my ſelf from the Troops you command;
and for the Satisfaction that I hope to ſee ſo great

rough Draught to an Italian Secretary, who

Ceremonies and Titles agreed on.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LAſt Year I ordered the Imperial Miniſter at
my Court, to acquaint his Maſter, That
<hi>Vienna</hi> would be beſieged the beginning of this,
becauſe I had Advice of it from good Hands.
So ſoon as the Confederacy and the Diet were
over, I cauſed my Secretary to write to Cardinal
<hi>Barbarini,</hi> that in caſe <hi>Vienna</hi> ſhould be beſieged,
I would go in Perſon to ſuccour it. I received the
News of its being beſieged on the Twenty Third
of <hi>July</hi> between <hi>Warſaw</hi> and <hi>Cracow.</hi> In a
Months time I have raiſed an Army without
Money; for the Provinces have ſcarce begun to
pay their Contributions. I gathered together
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54820:142"/>
the Troops that were in <hi>Podolia</hi> towards <hi>Caminiec;</hi>
and thoſe which cover the Frontiers of <hi>Ukrania:
I</hi> cauſed them to make long marched inſomuch
that in a little time they have marches, above
an hundred German Leagues, without having had
Reſt or Intermiſſion. And ſeeing I have Advice,
every Moment that the City, which has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
only forty Days, and defended by a whole
Army, is notwithſtanding reduced to a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;
I ſend part of my Army before, with
the Lieutenant General, who will join the Duke
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> the Day after to Morrow. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every Body wants my preſence, and that my
Huſſars, Cannon and Infantry can march but four
German Leagues a Day, I take this Day ſome
Troops of light Horſe with me, and by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God ſhall be upon the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi>
by the laſt Day of this Inſtant, to ſee and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and the other

<hi>Vienna;</hi> and we ſhall forthwith paſs the River,
which we wiſh to render yet more glorious, by the
defeat of the Infidels. Let your Holineſs now
judge if you ought to give Credit to thoſe who
would have made you believe that the Polanders
would do nothing this Campagne; and that the
King would never go out of his own Kingdom
The King and his Army ſhall be ſooner at the
Gates of <hi>Vienna,</hi> that one could have expected to
have heard of his departure out of his own Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.
And then you may reflect whether or no
one can do more for a Friend and Allie; but in ſo
far as it concerns the good of the Church and
Chriſtendom, I and my Kingdom ſhall be always
ready to ſhed the laſt drop of our Blood, as a
true Shield of Chriſtianity.</p>

               <head>AN
ACCOUNT
OF THE
Raiſing of the SIEGE
OF
VIENNA.
Written by Order of the Queen of
POLAND.</head>
               <p>THIS Account is properly an Abſtract of
the Letter, which the King of <hi>Poland</hi>
wrote to the Queen by the ordinary Poſt,
five or ſix Days after the departure of the Courier,
which he had ſent the Day after the raiſing of the
Siege, who only carried the News by Word of
Mouth; whereof the King afterwards made an
ample Relation to the Queen. This is an Abſtract
of the Circumſtances, and particularly of the
very Words in which the King wrote them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
together. The Reader may obſerve ſome
Verboſity and extravagant Praiſes therein; but it
is the Genius of the Nation and of the Poliſh Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which is full of Periphraſes and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutions,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54820:143"/>
which in that Country they reck on to
be great and ſublime; ſo that they make a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
at ſaluting one, or for a Compliment of
nothing.</p>
               <p>The Victory which the King of <hi>Poland</hi> hath
obtained over the Infidels, is ſo great and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
that paſt Ages can ſcarce parallel the ſame;
and perphaps future Ages will never ſee any
thing like it. All its Circumſtances are as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to Chriſtendom in general, and to the
Empire in particular, as glorious to that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.
On one hand we ſee <hi>Vienna</hi> beſieged by
three hundred thouſand Turks; reduced to the
laſt extremity; its Outworks taken; the Enemy
fixed to the Body of the Place; Maſters of one
Point of the Baſtions, having frightful Mines
under the Retrenchments of the beſieged: We
ſee an Emperor chaſed from his Capital; reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to a Corner of his Dominions; all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
at the mercy of the Tartars, who have filled
the Camp with an infinite Number of unfortunate
Slaves that had been forcibly carried away out
of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> On the other hand, we ſee the King
of <hi>Poland,</hi> who goes out of his Kingdom, with
part of his Army, and haſtens to ſuccour his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
who abandons what is deareſt to him, to
march againſt the Enemies of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
willing to act in Perſon on this Occaſion,
as a true Buckler of Religion; and will not
ſpare his eldeſt Son, the Prince of <hi>Poland,</hi> whom
he carries with him, even in a tender Age, to ſo
dangerous an Expedition as this was. That which
preceded the battle is no leſs ſurprizing. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
aſſembles on all ſides, the Elector's of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony</hi>
and <hi>Bavaria</hi> come in Perſon to join their Troops
with the Imperialiſts under the command of the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> Thirty other Princes repair
out of Emulation, to one another, to the Army,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54820:143"/>
which nevertheleſs, before they will enter upon
Action, ſtay for the preſence of the K of <hi>Poland,</hi>
whoſe preſence alone is worth an Army.</p>
               <p>They all march with this Confidence. The
King paſſes the <hi>Danube</hi> firſt, and leaves no Troops on
the other ſide to cover <hi>Moravia</hi> from the Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
that the Malecontents under Count <hi>Teckley</hi>
might make into the ſame, as the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
had propoſed; becauſe, ſays the King, he
had wrote to that Hungarian Lord, that if he
burnt one Straw in the Territories of his Allies,
or in his own, he would go and burn him and all
his Family in his Houſe, ſo that this was enough to
protect that Country during the diſtance of the
Army. He leads them afterwards through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented
Defiles to the tops of the Hills of <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and in ſight of the Turks, who drew out of
their Camp to put themſelves in order, and
even attack'd the Imperialiſts by break of Day on
Sunday the 12th of <hi>September,</hi> before the King
of <hi>Poland</hi> had made an end of forming his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Battle, and extending his Lines, in
which his Majeſty had mixed his Huſſars, and
other Poliſh Troops among thoſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Turks leave their Trenches
well provided with Janiſaries, with a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Body at the Poſts and at the Attacks, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the beſieged from ſallying out; hoping to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the Siege at the ſame time as the Army
ſhould make head againſt the Succours of the
Chriſtian Princes; and truly they had wherewith
all to back this proud Reſolution; having above
300000 Men, according to the King's Account,
who found above 100000 ſmall Tents in their
Camp, wherein apparently according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of diſpoſing their Men, there were at leaſt
three Men in each; and his Poliſh Majeſty has
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54820:144"/>
reduced the common Report of 300000 Tents
which would infinitely augment the number of
Soldiers to that of 100000.</p>
               <p>The Battle was fought on the 12th, it laſted
14 or 15 Hours; the ſlaughter was horrible, and
the loſs of the Turks ineſtimable, for they left
upon the Field of Battle, beſides the Dead and
Priſoners, all their Canon, Equipage, Tents and
infinite Riches that they had been ſix Years ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together throughout the whole Ottoman
Empire. There was found in their Camp above
a Million of Powder, Bullets, Balls and other
Ammunition, without reckoning the Powder that
the Servants burnt by inadvertency in ſeveral
Places of the Park of the Artillery the flame
whereof made an Emblem of the terrible day
of Judgment, with the Earthquakes that will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
it; and that thick Maſs of Clouds that
will obſcure the Univerſe: A Loſs nevertheleſs
which ought to be called a great Misfortune, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'tis above a Million more, as the King aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
us in his Letter, that he wrote himſelf to
the Queen, from which all theſe Particulars are
extracted.</p>
               <p>The Battle ended by the Infantry of the
Trenches, and of the Iſle of the <hi>Danube,</hi> where
the Turks had a Battery. The Night was ſpent
in ſlaughter, and the unhappy Remnant of this
Army ſaved their Lives by flight, having abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all to the Victors; even an infinite Number
of Waggons, loaden with Ammunition, and
ſome Field-pieces, that that deſigned to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with them; and which were found next
Day upon the Road they had taken; which makes
us ſuſpect that they'l not be able to rally again, as
neither having where withal to incamp themſelves
nor Cannon to ſhoot with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:54820:144"/>
So ſoon as the Grand Viſier knew the Defeat
of his firſt Lines, he cauſed a red Tent to be
pitched at the Head of his Main Body, where he
reſolved to dye for the Ottoman Empire, but his
laſt Efforts were to no purpoſe; and the
Wing of the Imperialiſts, which he attacked with
all his might, was ſo opportunely ſuccoured by
the preſence of the King, who brought part of
the Troops of his left Wing thither; that all fled
before him. So ſoon as he perceived the red Tent,
knowing by it that the Viſier was there in Perſon,
he cauſed all his Artillery to fire upon that Pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
encouraging the Activity of the Gunners by
conſiderable Recompenſes promiſing them fifty
Crowns for each Cannon-ſhot; and theſe leveled
their ſmall Pieces ſo well, that they brought down
the Tent of the Grand Viſier; and the Troop
of Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> his ſecond Son, had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to break through that Body of Cavalry,
at the very Place where the Viſier was, who was
diſmounted, and had much ado to ſave himſelf
upon another Horſe; having left, among the
ſlain, his <hi>Kiayia,</hi> that is, <hi>his Lieutenant General,
ad the ſecond Perſon of the Army;</hi> with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of conſiderable Officers; all the Standards;
the Marks of his Dignity that are carried before
him, or that are ſet up before his Pavilions; even
the great Standard of Mahomet, which the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
had put into his Hands when he ſet out upon
this Expedition; and which the King has ſent to
<hi>Rome</hi> by the Sieur <hi>Talenti,</hi> one of his Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to be a Teſtimony to the Pope, of this great
Victory.</p>
               <p>The King underſtood afterwards by Deſerters,
who come every hour in Troops to ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to him, as well as the Renegadoes, that
the Viſier ſeeing the defeat of the Army, called
his Sons to him, imbraced them, bitterly bewailed

their Misfortune, and turned towards the Han of
the Tartars, and ſaid, <hi>And thou, wilt not thou ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
me?</hi> To whom the Tartar Prince replied,
That he knew the King of <hi>Poland</hi> by more than
one Proof, and that the Viſier would be very happy
if he could ſave himſelf by flight, as having no
other way for his Security, and that he was going
to ſhow him Example.</p>
               <p>The Grand Viſier being thus abandoned, took
the ſame way, and retired in Diſorder with only
one Horſe; that which he had in the Battle, and
was armed all over with Steel, having fallen
into the Hands of the King with all the Equipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of that Ottoman General; who has left his
Majeſty Heir to all his Riches. In effect, his
Letters were dated from the Tents of the Grand
Viſier, the Park whereof was of as large Extent
as the City of <hi>Warſaw</hi> or that of <hi>Leopold;</hi> inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his Baths, Fountains, Canals, a Garden, a
kind of Menagerie or Place for ſtrange Beaſts and
Birds, with Dogs, Rabbets and Parrots. There
was found an Oſtridge of an admirable Beauty,
which had been taken from one of the Emperor's
Country-Houſes, and whoſe Head the Viſier's Men
cut off in their Retreat, that it might not ſerve to
adorn the King's Menagerie. This Precaution
would have been of greater uſe if they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it with Reſpect to the Standard of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
and of that prodigious Quantity of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Bows, Quivers, Sabres ſet with Rubies, and
Diamonds, precious Moveables and Equipages of
great Value, that were left with the Tents to the
King of <hi>Poland;</hi> which made that Monarch ſay
very pleaſantly in his Letter to his Queen, <hi>You
will not tell me at my return, what the Tartarian
Women tell their Husbands when they ſee them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the Army without Booty; Thou art not
a Man, ſeeing thou returneſt empty handed; for
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54820:145"/>
doubtleſs he was the firſt in the Battle, who returns
loaden with the Spoils of the Enemy; the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
having made me his Univerſal Legatee.</hi> The
Booty that was taken in this Action is infinite and
ineſtimable: The Field of Battle was ſowed with
Gold Sabres, with Pieces of Stuff, and ſuch a
prodigious Quantity of other things that the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
which has already laſted three Days, will
ſcarce be over in a whole Week, although the
Beſieged are come out of the Town in great
Companies to partake of the Booty with the
victorious Soldier; both the one and the other being
ſcarce able as yet to perſwade themſelves that this
happy ſucceſs is real, it is ſo extraordinary: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the whole Army, which nevertheleſs
has done its duty very couragiouſly, can't forbear
to attribute this great Victory to the mighty God
of Battles, who would make uſe of the Hands of
the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to overthrow the Enemies of
his Name; for which let him be honoured and
glorified for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>The King did not taſte all the Joy that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
will feel, as well becauſe his great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is accuſtomed to Victories, as by the Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he made upon the lamentable Spectacle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was pierced when he entred into the
Camp of the Turks, at the ſight of an infinite
Number of Slaves, whoſe Throats the Infidels
had cut after their defeat, and whoſe Bodies yet
chained were extended confuſedly amongſt the
dying and the wounded. The King was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
touched with a Child of about four Years
of Age, who ſeemed to be admirably beautiful
notwithſtanding he was coverd all over with Blood
from a wound he had received on his Head.</p>
               <p>The Deſolation was nothing leſs in the City of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> where the King entered the Day after the
Battle, and found heaps of Ruines, rather than
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:54820:146"/>
Houſes, and even the Emperor's Palace reduced
to Aſhes, hy the Cannon and Bombs: but he
was eaſed of the Grief which this diſmal Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
had occaſioned, by the Acclamations of the
Inhabitants, who thinking no more of their paſt
Calamities, were tranſported with Joy for their
unexpected Deliverance: The City not being able
to hold out two or three Days more. Some
kiſſed his Hands, ſome his Feet and others his
Robe: And all cryed out, that they might be
permitted at leaſt to ſee and admire the Hand
that had delivered them from the Bondage they
had been ſo near reduced to: They called him
their Saviour: And ſome of them dropt out that
they muſt have ſuch an Emperor as this magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
King. His Majeſty would have willingly
put a ſtop to thoſe Acclamations, and deſired
the German Officers to ſilence the People, but all
in vain, for it was impoſſible to ſtop the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the Burgers who repeated their Cries of
<hi>Long live the King!</hi> wherever that victorious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
went.</p>
               <p>After having viſited ſome Churches, where he
returned thanks to God for the happy deliverance
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> he dined with Count <hi>Staremberg</hi> the
Governour where he was no leſs fatigued with
Embraces than he had been with the Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Streets. The Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
the other German Princes, the Officers and all
the Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as one may ſay, run thither, as
ſoon as they had Notice of it, to ſee him
near at Hand, whoſe valour they had ſo much
admired in the Battle. The Princes imbraced and
kiſſed the King, with ſuch Tranſports as are eaſily
pardoned in extaſies of Joy, where Reſpect is a
little neglected, which cannot be attributed to any
want of Conſidaration, for they had given him
very great Marks of it, by the Submiſſion with
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54820:146"/>
which they had always obeyed him, and which
that Monarch had wrote to the Queen, was with
more promptneſs and leſs reſerve than that of his
own Troops. He returned afterwards into the
Camp, followed by the Princes, where he was
joined by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and Elector of
<hi>Saxony,</hi> who had not ſeen the King ſince the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
before the Battle, becauſe they had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
imployed at the head of the left Wing.</p>
               <p>The King was afterwards obliged to change his
Camp and to remove it two Leagues beyond the
Field of Battle, becauſe the ſtench of the dead
Corps began to be infectious. He propoſed to
himſelf at the ſame time to purſue the Enemy
cloſe, to give them no reſpite in their flight; and
was ſo puſhed on with the Ardor of his Zeal
that he could not give himſelf a Minutes reſt.
In the mean time the Emperor advanced in great
diligence to ſee him, and arrived at <hi>Vienna</hi> two
Hours after his Majeſty departed thence: But the
King did not retard his March for it, preferring
the Security of his Victory, and the Intereſt of
of the Party to the Joy which doubtleſs he would
have had to ſee the Emperor, who likewiſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
deſired to ſee him. He marches then directly
after the Enemy whom he had reſolved to purſue
into <hi>Hungary</hi> whither he had directed his flight;
the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Bavaria</hi> reſolved alſo
to follow his Majeſty, even to the end of the
World, as they themſelves told him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
having joined themſelves in ſtrict Frindſhip to
his Perſon, as had the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to the
Prince of <hi>Poland</hi> in particular, with whom he
would have divided his Spoils. This victorious
Army may juſtly be compared to that which <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
of <hi>Boulogne</hi> led in triumph thro' the <hi>Holy Land;</hi>
and ought to be the more ſatisfied with their
Glory, for that the Victory, though bloody, coſt
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:54820:147"/>
them but very few Men of Note, among whom is
reckoned only the Prince <hi>de Crouy</hi> of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;
and of the Polanders the Staroſt <hi>Halitski,</hi>
Son to the Caſtellan of <hi>Cracow, Potoski;</hi> and
<hi>Mordreoski</hi> Treaſurer of the Court; whom the
King particularly regretted. This ſurprizing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
ought alſo to be attributed to a viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Lord, according to the Viſion of
Father <hi>Marc d'Aviano,</hi> a Capuchin of a very
Holy Life, who adminiſtred the Sacrament to the
King, and the Prince his Son on the Morning of
that memorable Day; who poſitively affirms,
that he ſaw a white Dove fly in a Circle over the
Chriſtian Army during the whole Action; and it
was obſerved during the King's march, that an
Eagle followed his Majeſty 7 Leagues, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
its flight, ſo as to be always over his
Head. One may obſerve an Effect of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
upon the ſacred Perſon of this Hero, who
expoſed himſelf (like the meaneſt Soldier) and
upon that of the Prince his Son, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
by his ſide, wherever he went. The ſame
may be alſo ſaid of the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
who in the moſt dangerous Places teſtified a
Courage worthy of the Origin he comes of, and
who was always by the King's ſide during the
Battle. I ought not to forget the Count <hi>de
Maligni,</hi> the Queen's Brother, to whom the King
in his Letter gives an Account of the Valor and
good Conduct of that French Lord, whereof he
was an Eye-witneſs.</p>
               <p>Let us conclude this Account as the King hath
done his, and let us return Thanks to God for
this memorable Victory, in which he did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Infidels to ſcoff us, nor to ask, <hi>Where
is the God of the Chriſtians?</hi> ſeeing they have felt
his Power upon this Occaſion.</p>
               <p>

Every thing ſhews the greatneſs of the Victory
which the King obtained; and the ſole Number
of the things that were found in the Enemy's

LETTER
FROM THE

TO THE
KING

               <opener>
                  <salute>Moſt Serene King,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>SInce Your Majeſty invited us to enter into a
League againſt the common Enemy (upon
which our Republick made it appear, how much
Veneration was due to the generous Sentiments of
Your Majeſty, as You may have underſtood by
our Anſwers) there happens now a Motive, from
what has been repreſented to us by the Imperial
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:54820:152"/>
Ambaſſador, which has induced the Republick to
think it neceſſary, to make no longer delay, to
teſtifie their Readineſs to do all on their ſide
that may be Advantagious to the Good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.
We conſider (tho' the Republick is ſtill
ſenſible of the great Damages they ſuffered in the
late War of <hi>Candia,</hi> wherein they ſpent immenſe
Summs, with the Blood of their Citizens and the
Subſtance of their Subjects) that we muſt truſt
to the Help of God, to the Aſſiſtance and Zeal
of the Sovereign Biſhop our common Father,
and to the Continuation of ſo Holy a League as
this, which will grow daily ſtronger and ſtronger,
eſpecially being aſſiſted by Your Majeſty's puiſſant
and ſtrong Arm which has over thrown the Turks,
and put them to flight with ſo much Valor and
Courage, and which continues ſtill in that conſtant
Courſe of defeating them, as we have juſt now
heard with great Joy. We communicate to You
the Diſpoſition of the Senate, which is very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to enter upon this grand Affair, which being
well examined, We may conſult to do that which
ſhall be thought moſt convenient for the good of
the Catholick Religion, and ſeeing the Republibk
profeſſes a ſingular Reſpect to Your Majeſty, who
is to have ſo great a ſhare in this Alliance; they
were willing to acquaint you with it forthwith;
firmly believing that You will heartily approve of
it. In the mean time, we ſhall expect Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Anſwer, that we may give the neceſſary
Orders to advance and eſtabliſh ſo important a
Treaty. And deſiring Opportunities to teſtifie the
good Will which we bear to Your Royal Perſon.
We wiſh Your Majeſty long and happy Years, and
the continual Bleſſing of God upon the Valor of
Your Arms.</p>
