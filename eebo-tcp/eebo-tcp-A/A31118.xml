            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Caſe of Sir WILLIAM BASSET.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT</hi> Sir <hi>Joſeph Killigrew</hi> being ſeized in Fee of the Mannor and Rectory of <hi>Laurack</hi> and <hi>Barton</hi> of <hi>Ints</hi> in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi>
did heretofore deviſe the ſame to Sir <hi>Henry Killigrew</hi> (his Brother) in tail, the Remainder to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his
onely Daughter (the Plaintiffs Mother) in Fee Simple.</p>
            <p>That Sir <hi>Henry Killigrew,</hi> having ſuffered a Common Recovery, did by a Will he made the 12. of <hi>November</hi>
1644. mention to give the ſaid Mannor and Premiſes to Mrs. <hi>Jane Berkley</hi> for life, Remainder to <hi>Henry Hill</hi>
(his Natural Son) in tail, Remainder to the right heirs of Sir <hi>Joſeph Seymour;</hi> which Will he afterwards revoked
by a latter Will, that is now ſuppreſt, and left the Premiſes to deſcend, by his death, on the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Plaintiffs Mother,
being his next heir as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>That upon the death of Sir <hi>Henry Killigrew, William Baſſet</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife (the Plaintiffs Father and Mother)
and whoſe heir he is, did enter upon the Premiſes, and being ſo in poſſeſſion, and ſequeſtred, Compounded at <hi>Goldſmiths-hall,</hi> and
paid 570 <hi>l.</hi> for the ſame.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Edward Noſworthy</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> being Neighbour to the Premiſes, (after others in diſlike of the Title had refuſed to deal therein)
tempted by the hopes of making extraordinary advantages thereby, in 1651. agreed with Mrs. <hi>Berkley,</hi> not only for the purchaſe of
her pretended Eſtate for life in the Premiſes, but alſo for the ſaid <hi>Hill</hi>'s Eſtate therein; and becauſe he was an Infant, not above 15
years of Age, for the accompliſhing Mr. <hi>Noſworthy</hi>'s ends it was Articled as part of the Agreement, that Mrs. <hi>Berkley</hi> ſhould place the
ſaid <hi>Hill</hi> (being left in her care) as an Apprentice to Mr. <hi>Noſworthy</hi> for 8 Years, that ſo he might have him in his poſſeſſion, and the
better opportunity to get conveyances from him, and for the ſtrengthening of Mr. <hi>Noſworthy</hi>'s Title, it was alſo agreed between
them, that ſeveral old Statutes of great penalties then in Mrs. <hi>Berkley</hi>'s power, on which there was little or nothing due, ſhould be
aſſigned to protect Mr. <hi>Noſworthy</hi>'s purchaſe.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Noſworthy</hi> being conſcious of the defect of his Title in or about the Year 1653. for corroboration thereof, obtained a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of the Premiſes from the pretended Truſtees at <hi>Drury-houſe,</hi> as ſold for Sir <hi>Henry Killigrew</hi>'s Delinquency; and though great
ſums are mentioned to be paid to the pretended Powers then in being for the ſame, nothing was really paid; but all the pretended
purchaſe money reprized for the ſaid old Statutes, and yet that ſo far availed him, that the Plaintiffs Father being ſequeſtred for his
Loyalty, durſt not appear to ſet up his intereſt againſt the ſaid pretended purchaſe during the time of the late Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>That Mr. <hi>Noſworthy</hi> having then no way to hold the poſſeſſion of the Premiſes any longer but by colour of the old Statutes (on
which there was little or nothing due, as aforeſaid) <hi>Henry Seymour</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (who after the death of the Plaintiffs Father married the
Plaintiffs Mother) did with her in her right in 1660. exhibit their Bill in the Exchequer againſt <hi>Noſworthy,</hi> to ſet aſide thoſe incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
and be admitted to try their Title. Whereupon by Order of that Court (as moſt juſt) it was tried at that Barr; whether the
Will of Sir <hi>Henry Killigrew</hi> in 1644. were revoked? which upon two ſeveral Trials, one by a Jury of Gentlemen of Quality of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi>
the other of <hi>Berks,</hi> was found ſo to be, and Verdicts paſſed in both for the Plaintiffs Title.</p>
            <p>That notwithſtanding thoſe two Verdicts in regard the Plaintiffs refuſed to conſent to another Trial at that Barr, the Bill was
22. <hi>Nov.</hi> 1666. diſmiſſed out of that Court, but without prejudice to his right in Law or Equity.</p>
            <p>Thereupon in 1667. Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> and his Lady preferred their Bill in Chancery, to which Mr. <hi>Noſworthy</hi> pleaded the Diſmiſſion
in the Exchequer, and that he was a Purchaſer really and <hi>bona fide</hi> for valuable conſideration; which Plea coming to be heard by the
Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman,</hi> aſſiſted with Judges, was over-ruled and <hi>Noſworthy</hi> ordered to anſwer, ſo as to bring the validity of the Will
in 1644. into queſtion, and to try whether it was revoked. Which Order <hi>Noſworthy</hi> refuſing to obey, after many contempts returned
againſt him, it was half a Year after ordered that the Iſſues ſhould be taken as tried againſt him, and the cauſe to be heard in <hi>Trin.
Term</hi> 1668. but before that day the Plaintiffs Mother died, and the Suit abated.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>Trin. Term.</hi> 1670. the now Plaintiff brought a Bill of Revivor, to which the Defendant demurr'd; which the Lord
Keeper, aſſiſted with two Judges, on ſolemn debate over-ruled.</p>
            <p>That after the Defendant had ſate in contempt a Year and half more, it was in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1672. ordered, that the Defendant ſhould
put in his Plea by way of Anſwer, and accordingly an Anſwer was put in, and a Replication and Iſſue joined, Whether the Will in
1644. were revoked or not? and the Defendant joined in Commiſſion and exhibited Interrogatories, and many Witneſſes were
examined for the Plaintiff, (to his great charge) and thoſe depoſitions returned. But the Defendant having priviledge, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs
Clerk durſt not paſs publication. And then on the 8. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1673. the Defendant moved for a Commiſſion to examine
his Witneſſes; which was ordered accordingly: and after all this got an Order in 1674. to confine all Examinations to this Iſſue,
Whether the Defendant were a fair Purchaſer or not? On which Examinations it was proved that the premiſes were worth 18000 <hi>l.</hi>
and that <hi>Noſworthy</hi> paid but 2300 <hi>l.</hi> to Mrs. <hi>Berkley,</hi> and 500 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Hill;</hi> and that he got Conveyances from <hi>Hill</hi> by Fine and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
whileſt in his Infancy, and his Apprentice, on promiſes of marrying his Daughter to him, which afterwards he refuſed when
he had gotten the Fine from him. And that <hi>Noſworthy</hi>'s pretended purchaſe was not made till after others had refuſed to deal, as
diſliking the Title. And yet notwithſtanding the Cauſe being heard the 16. of <hi>July</hi> 1674. the Plaintiffs Bill was ordered to ſtand
<hi>Diſmiſſed;</hi> and that all the Depoſitions taken to prove the Revocation of the Will of 1644. be ſuppreſſed and vacated; whereby
he a Plaintiff in Chancery, is not onely denied Relief in Equity, but barred from having any Remedy at Law, his Witneſſes being
many of them dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which Diſmiſſion</hi> is grounded upon a ſuppoſed Fact, that the Defendant is really and <hi>bona fide</hi> a purchaſer of the Premiſes
for full and valuable conſideration without notice of the Plaintiffs Title, and ſo not to be impeached in any wiſe in a Court of
Equity. Whereas the Defendant is neither a fair, nor an honeſt purchaſer; but his pretended purchaſe was begun in a fraud, and
carried on in deceit of an Infant, by getting a Fine and other Conveyances from him unduely in his Minority by Artifices and
Tricks; and that without any adequate or competent conſideration paid for the ſame. Which being matter of Fact, the Plaintiff
cannot have any Relief therein by Bill of Review in the Chancery, or elſewhere. But is onely Relievable by Appeal to the
moſt High and Honourable Houſe of LORDS (the Supream Court of <hi>Judicature;)</hi> To whom he doth accordingly Appeal.</p>
