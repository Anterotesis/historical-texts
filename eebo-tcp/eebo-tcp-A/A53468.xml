            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>HE who comes hither with design to hiss,</l>
            <l>And with a Bum reverst to whisper Miss;</l>
            <l>To comb a Perriwigg, or to show gay Cloaths;</l>
            <l>Or to vent Antick nonsence with new Oaths,</l>
            <l>Our Poet welcomes as the Muses Friend,</l>
            <l>For he'll by Irony each Play commend:</l>
            <l>Next these, we welcome such as briskly Dine,</l>
            <l>At <hi>Lambs,</hi> at <hi>Lockits,</hi> or with <hi>Shateline:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Swell'd with Pottage, or the Burgundian Grape,</l>
            <l>They hither come, to take a kindly Nap.</l>
            <l>In these our Author don't conceive much harm,</l>
            <l>For they pay well and keep our Benches warm.</l>
            <l>And tho' scarce half awake some Plays they Dam,</l>
            <l>They'll doe't by whole-sale, not by Ounce and Dram.</l>
            <l>But when fierce Criticks get 'em in their view,</l>
            <l>Th'are Crustier than <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Peru:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They wrack each line, and every word unknit,</l>
            <l>As if they'd find a way to Cramp all Wit.</l>
            <l>They are the Terrour of all adventurers here,</l>
            <l>The very objects of their hate and fear;</l>
            <l>And like rude Common-wealths they still are knit,</l>
            <l>'Gainst English Plays, the Monarchies of Wit.</l>
            <l>They invade Poetick licence, and still rail,</l>
            <l>At Plays to which in Duty they shou'd veil.</l>
            <l>Yet still they infest this Coast to fish for Iests,</l>
            <l>To suppliment their Wits at City feasts:</l>
            <l>Thus much for Criticks, to the more generous Wit</l>
            <l>Our Author frankly does each Scene submit:</l>
            <l>And begs your kind alliance to engage,</l>
            <l>Those Lawless Interlopers of the Stage.</l>

               <p>By this light then, I think you are a Platonick too; for you seldom have to do with them your self, and so constantly set me to turn them over, that I want time to sleep. Pray <hi>Praeceptor meus,</hi> make your Addresses to them for 3 or 4 sixty minutes, while I take a Nap of a Parallel Extent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Yes, yes, and let Mr. <hi>Cudden</hi> for so long undisturbedly Court Mrs. <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Isabella,</hi> in the Garden, for there I left them, just now, together.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, as a Turky-cock, not that I care much for either of them; but a man looks so like a <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, when he is Cock of all the Hens on his own Dunghil. Why I tell you Tutor, 'tis the Noblest Prerogative that a Gentleman can have in his own House.</p>

               <p>Sure you think by these Excursions to draw me from my point; come, come Mr. <hi>Anthony,</hi> have you no Twitterings for Mrs. <hi>Isabella,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Philadelphia?</hi> No Dissembling? I have seen you often cast Sheeps Eyes at them.</p>

               <p>Sheeps Eyes said you?

               <p>A word in your Ear, Sir.—There's my Master, Mr. <hi>Cudden,</hi> hunting full cry after you; he is as sullen as a Colt that's newly Halter'd, and nothing but his eating Mr. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Heart, with a grain of Salt, can lay his fury. In one word, you must be his Second, and carry the fatal Letter of Defiance; you know the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front.</p>

               <p>E'en at Basket-hilt Cudgels, the Weapons he was bred up to; and he has chosen such a tuff one out of his Grandfathers Arsenal, and so much knottier than any Case amongst the Civilians, or School-men, that if he lights on Mr. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Pate, the Surgeons will think him wounded with a <hi>Geneva</hi>-Press, the Letters at one Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be so small and many.</p>

But Sir, I beseech you make haste, for I left him Practising to Fence against <hi>Hercules</hi> in the Hangings, whom he has so unmercifully thrash'd with his Straw-hilted Flail, that as you love that good Suit of Tapistry, fly to its Rescue.</p>

               <p>Honour said you! Why in one word, I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60297:10"/>
think honour is the greatest make-bate in the World: Let one quarrel for Love, Drink, Revenge, or Ambition, and Honour whispers in his Ear! Pray Gentlemen Fight, and say 'tis for my sake.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>I, Mr. <hi>Plot,</hi> come off with Honour, has a most Melodious sound; but to go on for Honour I detest it; it grates my Ears worse than a Mistresses denyal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plot.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Art,</hi> I assure you all that Mr. <hi>Antony</hi> has said was first to show his Wit, then his good Nature to his Kinsman. And now if you will walk a turn or two by your self, I dare promise you, he shall give as signal Evidences of his Valour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Art.</speaker>
               <p>I obey you Sir: But I beseech you be short, for my Friend is very Impatient.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Anton.</speaker>
               <p>Law you there now Mr. <hi>Plot,</hi> who a Devil would have to do with an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Man, if he could avoid it; and 'tis that only that I endeavour, and yet you would hinder me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Plot.</speaker>
               <p>Hear me er'e you condemn me, and observe well what I say; by the Laws of Duels.—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>Why are there any Laws for Duels? I thought all the Laws had been against them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plot.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, the Statute Laws are against them; but the Common Law that is Custome, has made it the mode, that the Challeng'd is to appoint the Weapons not the Challenger.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>I heartily thank you for this Information, for since he has broken the Laws, that's a fair Excuse to have no farther Correspondency with him, I hate to have to do with a Lawless Man; pray tell Mr. <hi>Art</hi> so from me, and then I am come off with Honour as you promis'd me; your Servant good Mr. <hi>Plot.</hi>

               <p>Nay Mr. <hi>Antony</hi> do but stay and hear me out on this Subject.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>I protest Sir I have heard too much already on this Subject: If therefore you will discourse on some new matter I am for you, or else your Servant, as I said before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plot.</speaker>
               <p>But you shall stay and hear me out, for it concerns your safety and your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; I say since he has nam'd Cudgels, tye him to those Weapons for his offensive Arms, and then you shall name Guns for yours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>I understand you, and the Notion is ingenious I confess: But Mr. <hi>Plot.</hi>—</p>

               <p>Why 'Faith Sir, I more fear to discharge a Gun in my own Hand, than a Cudgel in my Cousin <hi>Cuddens</hi>: But there is on a sudden a most admirable Notion come into my own Head, and I am in Labour till I am Deliver'd of it to you: 'Tis to choose Long-Bows and Arrows; by this light I could pelt him at that sport; for I am an Excellent Marksman; and I no more fear to shoot an Arrow out of a Bow (tho I say it that should not) than I now do Mr. <hi>Pedagogg.</hi>

               <p>Stay a little! You are so forward: As he has nam'd his offensive Arms, and I have chosen mine; so I hope! may wear defensive Arms too, tho he has not the discretion to think of them.</p>

               <p>I protest, you amaze and ravish me at once, Mr. <hi>Pedgagog,</hi> for you were still complaining how unapt my Son <hi>Antony</hi> was to learn, when he was in his Study.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, and how difficult it was to get him him thither.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ped.</speaker>
               <p>All this is right forsooth; but I did it in meer policy: For <hi>pia fraus</hi> is Lawful, as the Learned have determined; I know when once a young Gentleman comes to the Age of discretion, farewel Books and Learning for ever after! and therefore I did make the more Complaints that when he came to be of ripe years, he might be of a ripe understanding too: which now I do assure you he is—Arithmetick, Philosophy, Algebra, Metaphysicks, Mathematicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which he hath run through, I can tell your Worship with Joy: he understands <hi>Hebrew, Syriack, Arabick,</hi> nay and the <hi>Tutonick,</hi> as well as I do.</p>

               <p>A man that I have but lov'd too much, and a man that loves me too little: Oh Mr. <hi>Pedagog,</hi> did I give up that Fort to you, which had held out for 60 years against all Assaults and Batteries, and am I thus requited?</p>

This one affront will lose him his two Mistresses: The Rogue I must confess has a little the better Wit, but I a great deal the better Courage: which he palpably acknowledges by his Non-Appearance, I want only to compleat my happiness equal to my Victory: But that Mrs. <hi>Philadel.</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Isabel</hi> were now in view.

               <p>Nay if the word Resign offend your long Ears, I give you leave to put in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, Quit, Relinquish, Desert, Abandon or Forsake: You shall not find me over Scrupulous at Phrazing the Articles, so the thing it self be done, and done it must be Kinsman mine, for I never March thus Arm'd to the Field in vain.</p>

               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>Because you had not the Wit to forbid it; but why (for 'tis my turn to ask questions now) did you choose Cudgels?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cudd.</speaker>
               <p>Because I think no Woman worth the having a man kill'd for.</p>

               <p>I'm half of thy mind, and therefore I think fit to kill thee for a couple of Women; thou seest my Quarrel is two to one better than thine.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>O, am I the better provided? Truth will out at last. Acknowledge but that to my brace of Mistresses, and that shall serve me as much against all thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, as thy Resignation could: I like a voluntary Confession better than a forc'd one, and since thou hast so ingenuously declar'd the Truth, I will, in requital, turn my intended Tragedy into a Farce. Come, Sir, Uncase, Uncase, that was your Word when you thought me Sick, and that shall be my Word now I have made you so.</p>

               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I mean you shall off with your Cloathes, and Dance a Jigg to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument call'd a Bow and Arrows; that's <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Fiddle, and therefore the most fit Musick for a Lover.</p>

               <p>That was my Art, dear Cousin; I did as Crafty Merchants use, ask double Rates to get half for their Commidity. Besides, you Hector'd me into saying I lov'd both, because you scorn'd to Name the one you Lov'd. Alas! Cousin, do not you think I know one Woman is more than enough for any one Man?</p>

               <p>Ha! a pox of this Heart of mine, that must be panting after the wrong Petticoat; I'le make it keep <hi>Lent</hi> for this Impertinent Rampantness, <hi>Cudden</hi> too will beat me: Kinsman we must counter-march, take the better for the worse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign me up my Richer for Poorer, I had like, by a meer mistake, to have beaten up thy Quarters, while thou wer't beating up mine.</p>

               <p>Soft Sir, 'tis not my custom to be so inconstant, since Fortune has flung me on this beautiful Lady, here I'le fix: Face about <hi>Tony,</hi> and as you were.</p>

               <p>Very fine, and pray what did we fight our four Duels for this Morning: Have you forgot our Capitulations; as I take it they were not as you expound them now.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cudden</hi> I have over-reach'd you, worse then when I came with Bow and Arrows against your Case of Cudgels: For I was necessited when you said you were in Love with Mrs. <hi>Isabel,</hi> to seem joyful at it, and to declare my Mistress was Mrs. <hi>Philadelphia</hi>; when all the while I protest my Heart was ready to fly in the Face of my Tongue, for telling such an Egregious, Monstrous and Detestable Lye; therefore with blyth Countenance and merry Glee, thus I turn to my happiness, and leave you to your misery: By this light Mrs. <hi>Isabel</hi> I was always in Love with you, and you only.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cudd.</speaker>
               <p>Ha! ha! I could almost fall in Love with Mrs. <hi>Isabel</hi> for this witty Justice of hers; <hi>Tony,</hi> thus I turn to my happiness, and leave you to your misery.</p>

               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>Ha, ha, ha, <hi>Cudden,</hi> methinks your Mistress is somewhat witty in her Justice too: Commend me to Constancy in a Lover: You are likely to have a Campania to Exercise that Vertue in.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Ha, ha, ha. <hi>Antony</hi> on my life the Rogues were drunk: That ridiculous Comparison has converted my rage into laughter. 'Tis a strange thing Cousin, what diverse effects Wine produces in men; some it turns to Apes, some to Lyons, some to Elephants, and some to Bully-Rocks, of which latter sort our Fiddler-stealers are; and so for the present I let them pass. But mark what follows, for I am a kind of Prophet.</p>

               <p>Yes, yes, I have heard, and am now more troubled to find out a soucing revenge, than at the wrong I have suffer'd. — In the first place, I forswear by Bell, Book, and Candle-light, ever to Couple with <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>

               <p>And I must tell thee, that Mrs. <hi>Nan,</hi> who by the way has filch'd from me my heart, by my own consent, has promis'd me too, to bring me to the Hiding-place near the Arbour, where I shall be a Two-Ear-Witness of Mrs. <hi>Isabels</hi> Confession, which as soon as I have heard, I will take the like Oath as thou hast done; with this Vinegar and Gall addition, that I will less cheerfully Consummate Matrimony with Mrs. <hi>Isabella</hi> than with a Milch-Cow.</p>

            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>By the Mass, and he might be one, for he confess'd to me that he suffer'd a Female Circumcision at <hi>Paris</hi>: But an <hi>Hebrew</hi>-Congee is when one Marches boldly up to a Woman, and instead of Saluting her, you fetch approwet on your left Toe, and bow your Breech to her, and duck your Head from her Thus, which signifies, Adieu for ever with a Pox to you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cudd.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a brave Revenge; but I would do something.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>'Slid, then let's make them the <hi>Rabinical</hi>-Congee; for after that there can be no accommodation, 'tis a kind of passing over <hi>Rubicon,</hi> and cuts off all Treatise of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why, thus then: When you have turn'd your back-side to her, you open your Thighs wide, and then clapping your Head between them (an Emblem that the World is turn'd Topsy-turvy with you towards her) you say in a hoarse Tone, fare ill instead of fare wel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cudd.</speaker>
               <p>Excellent! For who can be such a Hen-hearted Hypocrite, as to say fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel to one who he detests, and would have fare ill?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>Right and Plain-dealing is a Jewel fit for a forsaken Mistresses Ear; besides, your Head being in that Position, it seems as if you spoke through your Breech, which is one of the unfavourest way of uttering ones self to ones Mistress, that can be fancy'd by the Wit or Malice of a Willow-Lover.</p>

            <l>Think what a famine there is now of Wit,</l>
            <l>And that we bring the best that we can get;</l>
            <l>Wit's e'en exhausted, and is almost spent,</l>
            <l>And you, with little Wit, must be content.</l>
            <l>Damn'd Plays shall be adorn'd with mighty Scenes,</l>
            <l>And Fustian shall be spoke in huge Machines;</l>
            <l>And we will purling Streams and Fire-works show,</l>
            <l>And you may live to see it Rain and Snow;</l>
            <l>So Poets save their Wit, they care not how.</l>
            <l>This all our Scriblers can perform with ease,</l>
            <l>Tickle the Fools, tho' not the witty please.</l>
            <l>If you expect true Comedy agen,</l>
            <l>That represents not Monsters, but shews Men,</l>
            <l>Your Expectations will be cross'd, we fear,</l>
            <l>For we have little hope to see such here.</l>
