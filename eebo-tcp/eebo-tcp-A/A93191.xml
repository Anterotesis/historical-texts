            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Upon Satterday being the firſt of this Moneth, about nine of the clocke, the Nobles of this City (having for many dayes together, as afterwards was plainly ſeene, reſolved and conſulted) comming with their men armed from their houſes, went into the Court, and firſt of all into the Secretaries Quarter, ſlew <hi>(A)</hi> there the Secretary <hi>Michael de Vaſconſellos,</hi> and tooke preſently all things into their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, together with the High Dutch and Spaniſh Watch, and her highneſſe Princeſſe <hi>Margarita,</hi> and ſome other of her Nobility; and the ſame time alſo, all the Counſellours, namely thoſe of the Chamber of Juſtice, high Counſell, the Court and Counſell of the Kings Revenews: And this being done, they came through the ſtreets of this City with the two Standards of the Chamber, proclaiming the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> King, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> the fourth: which thereupon alſo without any contradiction, was proclaimed by the Commons of the City, without ſlaying any man more, but him that's mentioned above, and another <hi>(B)</hi> Counſellour or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman of <hi>Albergaria,</hi> who was then by meere accident in the Secretaries Chamber, <hi>(C)</hi> and another being a German. Wherupon immediatly Governors were choſen and elected by the ſayd Nobles, with the two Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Lisbone</hi> and <hi>Braga,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne immediately to governe, and thereby the whole Citie was ſet in peace and quietneſſe, albeit the tumult was ſo great as could be, eſpecially there were ſet at liberty (in the name of the new King) out of two priſons in this Citie all the priſoners, excepting thoſe, that were caſt in priſon for extraordinarie theft, and albeit the ſame day no Court of Law was kept, yet no diſorder and confuſion happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: The aforeſaid Governours governed very well for five days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The ſecond day the Caſtle of the City was taken without making any ſhot againſt it, as alſo the Fort of <hi>Bethelem,</hi> the Fort of <hi>Cabeſa Seca</hi> came likewiſe to be taken by a ſtratagem, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly thereupon Poſtes and expreſſes were diſpatched for the City of <hi>Ville Viloſa,</hi> which brought word of it to the King, and the ſame Saturday at midnight he had notice of it, and thereupon diſpatched Expreſſes throughout the whole Kingdome.</p>

The aforeſaid <hi>Adayan</hi> (after that no cloyſter would take him in) went in a Prieſts habit towards <hi>Lerya,</hi> where the Biſhop his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hid him; and it is thought, that he is gone towards <hi>Caſtile:</hi> The Government of his Majeſty hath altered nothing in the Offices of the Commons, only hath caſheir'd the providor of the <hi>Alſandiga;</hi> becauſe he was ſonne in law to <hi>Dego Soares</hi> and the Count of <hi>Cuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda,</hi> who was Preſident of the Table of conſciecne the aſſiſtants and contractours remaine in their places, as they have been before: What in Caſtile is done, we know not as yet, becauſe of this newes, which is ſo great, whereof the whole world will ſpeake, Ambaſſadours are ſent towards the North, and towards <hi>England</hi> is gone <hi>Don Antonio Almada,</hi> and for <hi>France</hi> the upper <hi>Menteiro</hi> chiefe <hi>Hunter;</hi> &amp; for <hi>Holland Don Triſtan de Mendoſa,</hi> and for <hi>Rome</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mego,</hi> we ſhall ſee what good ſucceſſe their Ambaſſages will have, and ſo the reaſons, which are to be ſet downe and printed, and ſhall come abroad, and ſhall be added unto it. Her Highneſſe <hi>Margarita</hi> together with Marquis <hi>De la Puebla</hi> were impriſoned in the pallace of <hi>Enxobregas</hi> being watched by two companies, they have allowed them yearly 14000.

Hereupon his Majeſty begun preſently to governe, and all things were done in ſo good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that all the world cannot ſufficiently wonder at it, for after that he had maſtred the Fort of S. <hi>Iulian</hi> and al the Forts of his Kingdome he ſent for his Counſell, and after that they appeared before him the laſt of <hi>December:</hi> His Majeſty publiſhed and cauſed to be regiſtred a decree which you ſhall have ſhortly printed in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
