            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat and stupendious are the workes and wonders of the God Almighty, who onely searcheth the hearts and reines, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perspicuously knoweth the very thoughts and strength of man: For bee his vaine appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions never so cunning to contrive, his policy to conceale, or his boldnesse to out-face any nefarious act committed, yet his unsounded and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Wisedome, which can be no way circumscribed, is able at all times, and upon all occasions, as well to publish, as punish it in the open eye of the world, of which, as well those times past, as these present, have, and doe afford us remarkeable Examples: I will begin with the Sinne, before I proceed to the Fact.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27742:3"/>A Murderer, the <hi>Latines</hi> call <hi>Homicida,</hi> from <hi>home</hi> and <hi>caedo,</hi> id est, <hi>Hominem occidere,</hi> To kill a man: Now who the father of murder is, you may read in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> Chap. 8. Vers. 44. where our blessed Saviour speaking to the Pharisees, saith, <hi>Yee are of your father the Devill, and the lusts of your father yee will doe: He hath beene a murderer from the beginning, &amp;c.</hi> For the punishment thereof, read <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. vers. 5. <hi>For surely I will require your blood wherein your lives are, at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of a mans brother, will I require the the life of man: Who so sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God hath hee made man, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 31. <hi>Moreover, you shall take no recompence for the life of the murderer, which is worthy to dye, for he shall be put to death.</hi> That, for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now for the execrablenesse of the Sin: We find in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 11. God speaking to <hi>Caine,</hi> after the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> after this manner, <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art cursed from the Earth, which hath opened her mouth to Receive thy brothers blood from thine hand:</hi> As also <hi>Deutronomy</hi> 27. 24. <hi>Cursed be hee that smiteth his neighbour secretly: And all the people shall say, so be it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this monstrous sinne be so heynous in the sight of God, betwixt neighbour and neighbour, or if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by one stranger upon another, how much more horrid appeareth it in his eyes; when the husband and Wife, who in the matrimoniall Contract, are no more too, but one flesh, shall barbarously and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously insidiate one anothers life. According to that verse of the Poet:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Vivitur ex rapto, non hospes ab hospite tutus,</l>
               <l>Non socer a genero, fratrum quoque gratia rara est:</l>

               <l>Lurida terribiles miscent aconita noverci,</l>
               <l>Filius ante diem patrios inquirit in annos, &amp;c.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>which I have late read thus paraphras'd,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>All live on spoile, the guest is not secure</l>
               <l>In his Hosts house, nor is the Father sure</l>
               <l>Protected by the Sonne: even brothers iarre,</l>
               <l>True love and friendship is amongst them rare.</l>
               <l>The husband doth insidiate the wife,</l>
               <l>And she againe seekes to subplant his life:</l>
               <l>The rough-brow'd Step-dame her yong step-son hugs,</l>
               <l>Tempering for him (meane time) mortiferous drugs:</l>
               <l>The Sonne after the Fathers yeares enquires,</l>
               <l>And long before the day, his death desires, &amp;c.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Such were the passages of those times there amongst the Heathens, when Christianity was not knowne, but that they should be so familiar and conversant with us, is the more to be pittied and lamented.</p>
            <p>In the flourishing State of <hi>Rome,</hi> there were many temperers of poyson, and these were call'd <hi>Venificae,</hi> which word wee apply too, and conferre upon, Effaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Sorcery, and Witchcraft: Concerning which the Civill Lawes of the Empire thus speake, <hi>In institut. Iur. in fine in lege Cornelia,</hi> in the Cornelian Law, <hi>Et venifeci capite damnantur, qui artibus odiosis tam veneno, quàm susurris magicis homines occiderint, vel mala me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de camenta publice vendiderint,</hi> that is, Let those be held guilty of capitall offence, who by odious and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Arts, as well by poyson, as by magicke spells and wisperings, shall kill any man: In which State are likewise included all such, who shall publickly sell any evill Confections: From which Canon we may ground three severall sorts of delinquents in this kind, which passe under the name of <hi>Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:27742:4"/>
the first Poysoners, the second Sorcerers, or Witches, the third these Apothecaries or <hi>Empricks,</hi> who shall vend any mortiffarous drugs, knowing that by them any man or womans life, may bee infidiated, and in this case now in hand, though the seller (as he hath apparently justified himselfe may be excused, yet the byer as the Law hath openly convicted her, so we may presume that she is legally condemned.</p>
            <p>Now what the reason may be conjectured in these our latest, but worst dayes: that so many nefarious acts, equalling, if not farre surpassing these perpretated in former ages, should be new committed: as Catama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, Sodometry, Paracidy, many headed murders and the like: I can give no other reason then this, the contempt of the feare of God, and the neglect of his Sabbath.</p>
            <p>But to leave off all forraigne prodigious acts of the like horrid nature. Which as they are numerous, so they are manifest, in History and Chronologie, and go no further then our owne nation, and these latter dayes. Hath not one brother in the heat of Wine slame ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Taverne? A sonne transpersed the very wombe in which he was conceived, and suffered for the fault upon the Gibbet? A man in his drunkennesse casts his knife upon his Wife, and missing her, pointed it into the brest of his innocent childe, and kild him dead in the instant: hath not the woman offered the like out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, upon her husband in her fury, and left him dead in the place, and suffered lately for it, for remarkable example.</p>
            <p>Within the compasse of foureteene moneths or there abouts, one <hi>Enoch ap Evans,</hi> upon a small difference betwixt his brother and him, tooke the advantage
<pb facs="tcp:27742:4"/>
when he was asleepe cut his throat first, and after his head quite off with his knife, and when the mother hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a busling above, came into the roome to heare the cause of such a noise, he prosecuted her downe the stayers, and afterwards cut of her head with an <hi>Hatchet,</hi> for which he was Apprehended, arraigned, convicted condemned at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and after, some distance from the place executed.</p>
            <p>Since then, these grand Malefactors, who went com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by the name of <hi>Country Tom</hi> and <hi>Canbery Besse,</hi> their fearefull murders upon three severall Gentlemen, at three sundry times, (the discourse of whose Actions, Examinations, Confession, and Sufferings, because they are already published to the view of the World, I will no longer insist upon, or make any Repetition of their hainous crimes to trouble the Reader. But to come nearer to the matter of this fact now in Agitation, I will onely remember you of Mistresse <hi>Arden,</hi> who caused her Husband to bee murdered in her owne House at <hi>Feversham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> the memorable Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances thereof deserving places in a most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved Chronicle, may be very well spared in this short discourse. As also of Mistresse <hi>Page</hi> of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> who for poysoning her Husband, suffered with her sweet-heart Master <hi>George Strangwich,</hi> who had beene before time betrothed unto her: her husband being old, she yong, by which may be apprehended the misery of inforced marriage. But not to tire your patience I will onely trouble you with the poore wretched creature, who last suffered in <hi>Smithfield</hi> in this kinde, much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserated, much lamented: give mee leave a little to to insist upon her cause, and compare it with this now in present.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27742:5"/>Her injuries, and harsh and unmanly usage spurred on by the instigations of the divell, almost compeld her to what she did; which, as they would be scarce mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest for me to speake, so they were almost beyond the strength of Nature for her to suffer: shee being young and tender, he old and peevish; who notwithstanding his clownish behaviour, and churlish comportment towards her, as seldome or never affording her a smooth brow, or friendly countenance, used not onely to beat her with the next cudgell that came acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unto his hand, but often tying her to his bed-post to strip her and whippe her, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>A Iust cause, all persons may conjecture, was given on her part, of great dissensions likely to arise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her Husband and her selfe, unto selfe-will shee to be so addicted, disobediently to frequent the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of one <hi>White,</hi> of whom oftentimes her Husband hand had interdicted her his society and familiarity: which acquaintance of theirs was begun, before <hi>Clarke</hi> her Husband, entred into Marriage with her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with no small difficulty could be forgotten, or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, such former ancient entertainments. No ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
<pb facs="tcp:27742:6"/>
or threats to either parties could prevaile, that proceeded from <hi>Clarke</hi> unto his wife, or unto <hi>White,</hi> of continuall private meetings betweene them: Which <hi>Clarke</hi> perceiving, outragiously fell from words unto blowes with his wife, the smart whereof she feeling, incontinently begot in her heart dislike, and resolution of revenge on her Husband <hi>Clarke</hi> for the same, a fit humour for the devill to worke on, and to her old friend <hi>White,</hi> to give occasion, not of dislike, but content to put in practice what she intended, which he might easily perceive by many pensive declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in private utter'd betweene themselves of her Husbands unkinde usage: The confirmation whereof appeares by the words that proceeded out of her owne mouth.</p>
               <p>First, she confessed, because she often companied with <hi>White,</hi> that stirred up her Husbands iust anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>White</hi> and her selfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that unawares unto them both, her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band finding her and <hi>White</hi> shut up together privately in a Chamber in the house, on <hi>Ascension-day</hi> last in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone, was thereat so with fury enraged, that hee did beate <hi>White</hi> going out of the doores, and after that, freshly fell foule upon her, and so cruelly added blowe upon blow upon her body, that the markes thereof were very visible on her body at this present. Her old <hi>Love, White,</hi> instantly taketh this unto heart, and in a rage (as she said) uttered these words, <hi>That it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for one to be hanged, then to endure so discontented a life,</hi> and presently putting his hand into his pocket, he tooke out 4 Tokens, and gave them unto <hi>Alice Clarke,</hi> saying unto her, if he had had more money, hee would have given it unto her: which 4 Tokens so given unto
<pb facs="tcp:27742:6"/>
her, she went<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto <hi>Vxbridge</hi> forthwith, and that, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone bought a penny-worth of <hi>Mercury</hi> of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary in <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> intending the same unto her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, with a further reservation, that if her Husband had not taken it, she would have administred the same unto herselfe, and so put an end unto all her sorrows, as she vainely supposed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, she said, that she was not the cause of her Husbands death, because shee gave not unto him the poyson whereof he died, but he tooke it himselfe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently out of her pockets, which her Husband had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, upon hope to finde some chinke or money there: but of such hopes he altogether was disappointed and deluded. Whether this be not a lame excuse, or strange delusion, I referre it unto the censure of the Judicious; and no further discovery of the fact, could I get from her at that time.</p>
               <p>Shee further said, that on <hi>Ascension-day</hi> her husband violently attempted to drowne himselfe, which shee prevented by her language upon him: but in short space afterwards dyed that Night of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> taken by himselfe out of her pocket, as afore-said.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, shee seemed to be very much afflicted in conscience, that shee was a yeare since gotten with Child by her Master, with whom shee last dwelt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who perceiving the same, with a small summe of money, matched her unto <hi>Fortune Clarke</hi> her Husband, about <hi>Alhallontide</hi> last, whom she could not love, or have any matter of maintenance, but relied upon her Masters former promises for the same: and hee fayling of giving her meanes, fell into folly and wickednesse. A great clog unto such a mans conscience, if it be true; to seduce a woman unto his will, and so leave her.</p>

               <p>THough there be sundry sorts of <hi>Murther</hi> with their severall degrees, as open, or secret, acted upon a friend, a stranger, or ones selfe, yet in my opinion, I know not any of them which containes so much villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, neither including so many deepe circumstances in them, as that of poysoning: That I thinke is the reason that there are so few examples of it in Holy writ, this way either being then not knowne; followed, or practised; therefore to descrbe the quality of it and to aggravate it, I must wish you to consider these foure things.</p>

               <p>PHysitians of the Soule ought to immitate those learned Physitians of the body, frequent visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of those sicke patients, whose diseases are desperate and inveterate; and sometimes it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that they must desire, necessity so requireth, the advice and sound opinions of others their Colleagues.

That at the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond times of my visiting of her, little or no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I found in her, or her heart to be touched for her
<pb facs="tcp:27742:8"/>
most horrid clamorous crimes. This is apparant, if you compare her first confession unto this, how diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in truth, how improbable the one are unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nay what she confessed on <hi>Munday,</hi> shee was so far off to proceede in a further revealing of her selfe, that what touched her home, concerning her husbands death, she would have denied, though formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by her most confidently true.</p>
               <p>I was thereuppon inforced to hold her unto it, and to extract the truth, and trye her spirit, called two of the Keepers of the Goale, to her unknowne, whom I appoynted to obserue and remember the speeches that passed betweene us, to verifie them unto her face, which attestation both of my selfe, and of them, shee would out-face, but could not.</p>
               <p>Vppon <hi>Wensday</hi> morning, on which shee was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, there assembled unto Newgate multitudes of people to see her, and some conferred with her, but little good they did on her, for shee was of a stout angry dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, suddainly inraged, if you began to touch her to the quicke of her husband poysoning. Being that morning of her death accompanied and also assisted by divers of my worthy, grave, and learned brethren in the Ministery, before and at the time of her Execution, for which I doe most heartily thanke them, but that God whose worke it was, their reward for it with him is layd up in store. Like my selfe, they stood as men amazed, to perceive that none of theirs, or any other serious perswasions could for a great while prevayle with her, ioyned in opinion with me, that she was no fitting guest for the Table of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> thereupon, I made as though I would have excluded her thence, in denying the benefit of the holy Communion, of the
<pb facs="tcp:27742:9"/>
Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, inferring the benefit of the unspeakeable blesse, by the worthy receiving of it by Repentance and Faith, and the most woefull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction to all impenitent and unworthy receivers. Whereupon, it pleased God, so to mollifie her heart, that teares from her eyes, and truth from her tongue proceeded, as may appeare by this her ensuing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession at the very Stake, where she was executed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cordall,</hi> She riffe of <hi>London,</hi> relating the same with as loud and audible a voice, as possible she could, that many others besides, there present, were also wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of such her ensuing Confession.</p>
               <p>First she confessed that <hi>Henry White,</hi> who was arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a party with her, consenting unto her Husbands death, did give unto her one <hi>Ascension</hi> day in the after noon, foure brasse tokens, advising her therewith to goe and buy one penyworth of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and give it unto her Husband, saying, if that her husband were dead, she should live more quietly and contentedly with him, &amp; after such his death, that he the said <hi>White</hi> would marry with her; whereupon she went unto <hi>Vx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and that afternoone bought the <hi>Mercury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, shee confessed that her Master got her with childe a yeare since, which was her overthrow, and mediated for the <hi>Marriage,</hi> betweene her and her Husband, whom shee could not love, nor no way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. By her Masters perswasion, who sent her up to <hi>London</hi> to be <hi>Married,</hi> and payed the costs thereof, and further promised her maintenance during her life, if she did condescend unto his desiers, which were most unlawfull, dishonest, and unchaste, before and after her <hi>Marriage,</hi> with <hi>Fortune Clarke</hi> her Husband.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, shee confessed, that one of <hi>Hillinden</hi> inticed
<pb facs="tcp:27742:9"/>
her, to run away from her Husband, with him beyond the Seas, and that she did lodge in that mans house, and lay with him a whole fortnight, and speaking unto him of her Husband, that shee would not forsake him, hee thereupon advised her to pop him up with white bread and milke, and to put some thing else into it, to choak or stuffe up his throat.</p>
               <p>Fourthly she confessed, for the <hi>Mercury</hi> which she bought, shee intended it unto her Husband, but having no conuenient opportunity to dispose of it, she put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her sleeve, which her Husband as she said tooke it out of her hand, and then being over charged with drink he immediatly swallowed it down, which she percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, was thereat so perplexed, that she uttred these words unto her Husband, that he had undone both him selfe and her.</p>
               <p>And heere give me leave to note unto the World, what a deale of comfort she found, after shee had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdned her loaded conscience by confession, beeing demaunded at the same instant of her death, yea, or nay; that after such her confession, shee was by it the better prepared unto death, with comfort, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to suffer the same: Shee thus replyed with harty thankefulnesse unto God, that shee had better resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto death, then formerly she had, and by her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which was very ruddy confirmed her inward new begotten chearfulnesse, and that with harty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and sweet tone of voice, surrenderd her soule into the hands of the Lord <hi>Iesu,</hi> who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, unto whom wee all stand and fall.</p>
               <p>Heere is nothing contained in her confession, but that which true, and what she uttered with her owne mouth; which I was a witnesse off.</p>
