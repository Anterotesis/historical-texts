         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>MY Dedication looks very
Blank upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and 'tis no Wonder, ſince I
expect no Preſent for it. But
I may venture to ſay, that no
Dedication was ever leſs Fulſom
and Tedious, tho none can deny
that I have given my Patrons
a very fair Character. The
Severe and Judicious may quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
at me for Innovation in this
Affair; but ſince the greateſt
Critick of our Age has Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
a Dedication without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominating
<pb facs="tcp:150537:4"/>
his Patron, ſo the
leaſt has ventured to aſcribe his
Patrons, and leave out the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</p>
            <p>I have ſome few things to
ſay in Relation to the Author,
and touching the Book; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is a Perſon admired by the
Ladies for his Diſcretion and
Secrecy, as you may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
by theſe Means he has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to confirm their good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of him; and to make the
Secret yet cloſer, he has let it
looſe among the Wits, who will
ſo Chaſe it about <hi>Covent-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi>
but I queſtion whether they
ever Hunt it into the right
Burrough. If ye are ſo good
Philoſophers as to find out the
<pb facs="tcp:150537:4"/>
Author by a <hi>Negative Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
take it; he's neither <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieriſt,</hi>
nor <hi>Poet,</hi> neither <hi>Aeſop
of Tunbridge,</hi> nor <hi>Aeſop of
Bath,</hi> nor the <hi>Dragon of Bow,</hi>
nor the <hi>Graſhopper at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change;</hi>
and for an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
not to belong to any of
theſe Factions, is ſomewhat
ſtrange.</p>
            <p>As to the Book, 'tis for the
moſt part, matter of Fact, and
all Tranſacted within theſe Three
Months. The Criticks may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
quarrel with me for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Time; for (ſay
they) if an Heroick Poem muſt
be limited to the ſpace of Twelve
Months, a Novel by the rule
of Proportion ſhould be confined
<pb facs="tcp:150537:5"/>
to One. But I can urge enough
in my defence; perhaps I was
very Young when I writ it, or
Recovering from a fit of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
perhaps I was very Old
and near my great Climacterick;
perhaps I write it in haſte, or
perhaps 'tis my firſt Eſſay.</p>
            <p>Now, Gentlemen, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you <hi>Pick and Choiſe</hi> of the
moſt Faſhionable Excuſes, and if
you are not ſatisfied, I think
unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>Some may ask what I had to
do with the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Stage</hi>
in my Novel? Truly I have as
little to do with either of them
as any Wit among Ye, let them
fight Dog, fight Bear, for me.
But becauſe I would make my
<pb facs="tcp:150537:5"/>
Book <hi>Beau,</hi> I thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to Equip him with an Air
of the Times, and make him
Chat on the moſt Modiſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
As another Addition to
his Finery, I have given him a
<hi>Deſcription of Night.</hi> This
was altogether worn about Ten
years ago, and may do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
ſtill for a Change. I
build this Allegory of Foppery
upon the Authority of a famous
Modern, who certainly deſign'd
his <hi>Deſcription of Night</hi> for a
<hi>Beau-Wig</hi> to his Piece, as may
appear by this Line.</p>
            <p>And Nights Black-Locks all
Powder'd o're with Stars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:150537:6"/>
Some may accuſe me for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
imitation of my Nieghbours
in this Deſcription. Faith, I have
a great mind to imitate Them
very cloſely now by Valuing my
ſelf upon it however.</p>
            <p>Tou muſt not in this Piece
expect any Wit, for that is grown
too Dangerous and Scandalous
ſince the Act againſt <hi>Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Profaneneſs;</hi> beſides,
being within the City Liberties, I
muſt not venture to be Facetious,
till I know whether the New
Lord M—r is <hi>Dragon, Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper,</hi>
or what other Animal.</p>
            <p>As for my imitating <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
I confeſs 'tis not <hi>Copia
vera,</hi> as many draw their Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but there is ſomething as
<pb facs="tcp:150537:6"/>
Odd in this Gentlemans Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
as there was in Perſon,
which may puzzle an Author as
much as a Painter to delineate
him. There are ſome turns of Plot
in the following Adventures that
may ſeem incredible, but this
very ſtrangeneſs to any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Perſon will appear the moſt
convincing Proof of their Truth;
for unleſs they had really paſſed,
I could never have thought of
'em.</p>
            <p>One word to <hi>Emilia,</hi> and
then—She only knows the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
whom if ſhe diſcovers, he
certainly diſcovers her; there's
a <hi>Rowland for her Oliver:</hi> her
Character is drawn by ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Hand, that it will make
<pb facs="tcp:150537:7"/>
her Cunning more admired,
than her Falſhood hated. My
Love has ſtill added a pleaſing
gloſs to her worſt Deſigns, and
amidſt my ſevereſt Reflections
on her Deceit, I have never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the Reſpect due to her as a
fair Lady: Yet if ſhe will be
Angry, let her take what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

            <head>THE
Adventures
OF
COVENT-GARDEN.</head>
            <p>A Young Gentleman ſomewhat
addicted to Poetry and the
Diverſions of the Stage, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one Evening behind the Scenes in
<hi>Drury-lane</hi> Playhouſe, was accoſted
with a Meſſage by the Door-keeper,
that a Lady in the Entrance deſir'd
to ſpeak with him; he readily obey'd
the Charge, but was ſtrangly ſurpris'd
to be ſaluted by a Voice well known
to him, and a Perſon whom he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
in another Kingdom (one whom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150537:8"/>
he paſſionately lov'd) and whoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
he much regretted; their Joys
were mutual at the Interview, but
his the greater, becauſe heightn'd by
ſurpriſe and unexpectancy; <hi>for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
ſake, Madam (ſaid the Spark in a
tranſport) is your Husband dead?
and may I hope at laſt that you are
mine;</hi> The Lady anſwer'd only by a
deep Sigh, and conducting him to
the Coach which waited for her, ſhe
gave him the following account. <hi>You
may remember, my dear</hi> Peregrine,
<hi>(ſaid ſhe) that conſtrain'd by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of covetous Parents, who conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Fortune, not Inclinations, I broke
my Vows and Proteſtations to you and
married</hi> Richly. <hi>Revive not the fatal
remembrance (anſwer'd</hi> Peregrine)
<hi>which occaſion'd me ſo much miſery,
forcing me thro grief to leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and come hither for</hi> London,
<hi>but rather declare the cauſe which ſo
happily has Bleſt me now with your
Preſence ſo far beyond my hopes. Alas
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150537:8"/>
Sir, reply'd</hi> Emilia, <hi>why ſhou'd you
doubt the occaſion, knowing your ſelf and
knowing me? how could I reſt in the
Embraces of Another, whilſt nothing
but a narrow Sea parted me from my
dear</hi> Peregrine. <hi>I gave my friends
the ſatisfaction to ſee me married to</hi>
Richly, <hi>but did my ſelf the Juſtice to
live with none but my Deareſt—</hi>
with which words preſſing his Hand,
and letting her Head fall with a Sigh
in his Boſom, ſhe murmur'd out the
reſt in a Language which Lovers only
underſtand. The Coach ſtopt in
<hi>Bow-ſtreet Covent-Garden,</hi> where the
Lady had taken Lodgings. <hi>Pereg.</hi>
was a little ſtartl'd to find himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
oppoſite to a Houſe wherein
dwelt a Lady whom he Courted; for
being advis'd, that the only cure for
the loſs of an old Miſtreſs is a new
one, and his Fortune being very
much weakn'd by expence of Travel,
he had pitch'd on the aforeſaid Lady
of a conſiderable Fortune and good
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150537:9"/>
Family, to relieve his decay'd Eſtate
by marrying her; He had won pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
far on the Ladies Inclinations, and
Acted the Lover ſo well and ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that he had almoſt made it
habitual to him, and through pure
ſtrength of imagination did almoſt
believe her as captivating as his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Miſtreſs; but it was only a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
for he ſoon forgot all his Paſſion
at the firſt ſight of <hi>Emilia;</hi> and his
wavering Affection, like a leſſer Light,
was ſoon ſwallow'd in the appearance
of a greater; he conducted <hi>Emilia</hi> to
her Chamber, where they ſpent an
Hour or Two, pleaſantly repeating
the Adventures of their paſt Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and now and then making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
to improve the future. How
ſtrangely ridiculous are Lovers! this
Lady had been the greateſt cauſe of
many misfortunes to him, and he
had ſubſtantial reaſons to believe, the
rigour of her Parents was only urg'd
as an excuſe to break with him; a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150537:9"/>
reaſonable Perſon would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
her as a Renegado from her
lawful Husband, and might had ſome
regard to the Proteſtations made to
the vertuous Lady, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Fortune; I doubt not but
the Gentleman's reaſon, which was of
the ripeſt growth, ſuggeſted all theſe
conſiderations to him; but alas, that
Ingenuity which ſhew'd him his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
plung'd him the deeper in it;
the Charms of his <hi>Emilia</hi> were ſo
heightn'd by his creative fancy, his
Wit loooking through the Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of his Love, ſhew'd all things ſo
Charming that nothing but Paſſion
could predominate; and certainly the
moſt ingenious Men are the moſt
liable to the Snares of the Fair; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be that their Intellects are
more fine, and therefore more adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the reception of the ſubtile
Paſſion, or being more ſubject to
Vanity, may eaſily through a ſenſe of
their merit be drawn into a belief of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150537:10"/>
their being belov'd, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the more eaſily cheated.</p>
            <p>However it was, <hi>Peregrine</hi> went
away the moſt pleas'd Man alive,
and coming to his Club at the <hi>Roſe,</hi>
ſurpris'd the Company with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy
of his Mirth; no leſs
than Bumpers wou'd go down, and
all to his Miſtreſſes health; there was
none of the company diſpos'd to
comply with his humour, but a
Captain, who ſwearing a bloudy
Oath that put his Scarlet out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
declar'd he would Drink for
his Miſtreſs as much as <hi>Peregrine</hi>
ſhou'd for his Guts, <hi>and</hi> Damme <hi>(con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
he) I have got the prettieſt,
kindeſt creature, and ſhe is newly come
to Town; but what is yet ſtranger, I
have not yet enjoy'd her, tho I bave
ſeen her twice. I ſhou'd think it more
ſtrange (ſaid</hi> Peregrine) <hi>if you ever
enjoy her, if ſhe be one that values her
Reputation.</hi> Zoons <hi>(cry'd the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)
you loook like an honeſt Fellow,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150537:10"/>
and I'll tell you a ſecret; My Miſtreſs
is the prettieſt Lady in</hi> England, <hi>and
ſhe Lodges hard by in</hi> Bow-ſtreet. The
whole Company, who knew that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi>
Courted a Lady in <hi>Bow-ſtreet,</hi>
burſt out a Laughing, and one of them
ask'd the Captain where abouts his
Miſtreſs liv'd? <hi>About the middle of
the Street, (reply'd he)</hi> which increas'd
the Laughter all about the Table.
Here appear'd another Caprice in the
humour of our Lover: <hi>Peregrine,</hi>
who juſt now had forgot and laid by
all thoughts of his former Miſtreſs,
had his paſſion renew'd by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of a Rival, and his Flame
like other Fire, meeting with oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
began to rage more furiouſly;
he ask'd the Captain what incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he had receiv'd, to authoriſe
him to call that Lady Miſtreſs? <hi>Only
this (ſaid the Captain) that I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
by her above all Men in the
World, for which I have her own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.
Peregrine</hi> being ſenſible
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150537:11"/>
how far a Lac'd Coat and Feathers
uſually work upon the Female Sex,
was very uneaſy, and calling a Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
left the Company.</p>
            <p>Next Morning he went to <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>'s
Lodgings, but 'twas anſwer'd by
the Houſe that ſhe was gone abroad;
he repeated his Viſit in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
with no better ſucceſs; three
or four Days he continu'd to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her thus, but could never find her
at home: The Lady over the way
had perceiv'd him to go frequently
thither, and hearing that a ſtrange
Lady lodg'd there, began to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſome Jealous thoughts of him,
ſhe therefore order'd a Footman to
watch him at his next coming, and
to tell him that ſhe deſir'd to ſpeak
with him; the Meſſage was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
accordingly, and he waited on
<hi>Selinda. Sir (ſaid ſhe) I was afraid
that you had miſtaken my Lodgings, by
your freequent calling at another Houſe
ſo near me, and therefore I ſent my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150537:11"/>
Servant to ſet you right.</hi> He was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
from his ſweet Dream of <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
by ſo juſt a charge; but the words
of the Captain coming in his Head,
<hi>Madam (ſaid he) I ſaw the Sign of a
Lac'd Coat hung out at your Houſe,
which occaſion'd my miſtaking it.</hi> The
Lady deſiring him to explain his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
he plainly told her what the
Captain ſaid; ſhe aſſur'd him by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
convincing reaſons, that ſhe knew
no ſuch Perſon, and implicitly hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, that if he were the Lover
he pretended, it lay upon him to
make the Blockhead beg her Pardon.
<hi>Peregrine</hi> needed no ſuch inſtigation,
for by this it appear'd to him that the
Captains words were out of a dull
deſign of affronting him, and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Revenge wou'd have immediately
gone to have put it in Execution.
The Lady dreading the bluſtring title
of Captain, and fearing to Expoſe
<hi>Peregrine,</hi> whom ſhe really Lov'd,
detain'd him, by a pretence of his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150537:12"/>
Accompanying her to <hi>Bartholemew-Fair,</hi>
whether ſhe deſign'd to go that
Evening to Raffle; he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
waiting on her, and ſuſpended
therefore his intended reſentments.
The Lady's Coach was got ready, and
they went to the <hi>Cloyſters,</hi> where
they Joyn'd in with ſome very good
Company to Raffle, among which was
my Lord <hi>C—</hi> who had a Lady
Mask'd with him, and whom he
entertain'd with ſome Reſpect, yet
mix'd with a little Familiarity: The
firſt Piece of ſmall value my Lord
won, and preſented to his Mask'd
Lady; the ſecond, worth Ten pound,
<hi>Peregrine</hi> carried; not ſo glad for
his Succeſs, as Proud to make ſuch a
Preſent to his Miſtreſs; he was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards her to Preſent it, when
the Mask'd Lady with a careleſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if by accident, pull'd off her
<hi>Vizor,</hi> and ſhew'd him the Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Face of his dear <hi>Emilia;</hi> ſhe
imagin'd, obliging him to know
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150537:12"/>
her was Claim ſufficient to the <hi>China.</hi>
Gods! how great was <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s
ſurpriſe! What a ſtrange Dilemma
was he brought to! all the rules of
civility and good Manners, nay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
gratitude, oblig'd him to give
the Preſent to <hi>Selinda</hi> whom he had
waited on to the Fair, nay, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
had already begun to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
her ſucceſs in that of the
Gentleman; But <hi>Emilia,</hi> the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Emilia,</hi> that held his Heart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
his Hand; he had long ſince
made her a Preſent of his Soul, and
who now cou'd ſtand in competition
with her for any thing elſe: He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had ſuch occaſion for his Wits
to bring him off, but finding no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
readier, he pretending a Slip
let the <hi>China</hi> fall, and broke it, and
feigning a diſſatisfaction for the Loſs,
wou'd throw no more: Both the
Ladies were well enough pleas'd,
each imagining that he was vex'd
upon her ſcore, ſuppoſing he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150537:13"/>
it for her, which he purpoſely
broke, leſt he ſhou'd oblige either
by the diſpleaſure of the other.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Pereg.</hi> trouble was not here at
an end, he ſaw his <hi>Emilia,</hi> who ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſo lovingly careſſed him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
by a Nobleman, and one
of the greateſt Gallants in <hi>England;</hi>
but what wou'd have deſtroy'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
affection, only increaſed his;
he took a ſecret Pride in Rivalling
ſo great a Man, and it confirmed
his great opinion of <hi>Emilia</hi>'s beauty,
to ſee her Admir'd by ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh't
a Perſon and abſolute Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
as my Lord <hi>C—</hi> Theſe
conſiderations augmenting his Love,
increaſed his Jealouſy alſo, and every
little Familiarity that my Lord us'd,
heightned his Love to her, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
to his Lordſhip; he Lov'd her
for being Admir'd by my Lord, yet
hated my Lord for Loving her. He
was oblig'd however to wait on <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>
home; beſides he receiv'd no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150537:13"/>
great encouragment from <hi>Emilia</hi> to
prompt him to offer his Service, for
ſhe had not regarded him one Jot
after he broke the <hi>China;</hi> he went
Home ſtrangely diſtracted, which
<hi>Selïnda</hi> imagining it to proceed from
his reſentment againſt the Captain,
minded no further than by adviſing
him to deſiſt, telling him that the
aſperſions of a Fool are never mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unleſs the Perſon aſperſed takes
notice of them. He went Home
never the more ſatisfied, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to quit himſelf of one trouble
imediatly, he writ the following
Note.</p>

            <p>This Letter he gave to a Porter,
with orders to deliver it to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—
at his Lodgings, or
if he were abroad to find him out,
and to deliver it into his own Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peregrine</hi> roſe early next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and came to the place appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and walked about full of ſerious
thoughts upon his Adventure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on the many inconveniences
contracted by Womens converſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he remembred that the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets
of his Life had proceeded
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150537:14"/>
from Female cauſes, and found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that very Moment at the very
brink of Deſtruction, involv'd in an
unavoidable Dilemma of falling by
the Sword, or dying by the Law,
and all upon a Womans ſcore; he
found, that had he never Lov'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he had never hated Man, and
had he never owned a Miſtreſs, he
had never feared an Enemy. The
apprehenſions of ſo many dangers
paſt and to come, occaſioned chiefly
by his fatal <hi>Emilia,</hi> began ſomewhat
to alienate his affection, which bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by his ſuſpicion of her falſhood,
confirmed him in a reſolution of
weaning himſelf for the future from
ſo childiſh a Paſſion. He walked
thus ruminating above two hours,
but no news of the Captain, and
he was pretty well pleas'd not to
meet his Adverſary, being now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of the unreaſonable grounds
of his quarrel: Being upon ſerious
reflections convinc'd, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150537:15"/>
words might have intended
ſome other beſides his Miſtreſs, ſince
he did not name <hi>Selinda,</hi> and that
ſhe had aſſur'd him, ſhe knew no
ſuch Man. He left the Field, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
in theſe Three calm Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Firſt, for ever to avoid <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>'s
company which had been ſo fatal;
Secondly, to beg the Captains par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
when he firſt met him; and
Laſtly, to promote his Marriage
with <hi>Selinda</hi> as ſpeedily as he could.
But here behold the ſtrange weakneſs
of a Lover, his Inclinations muſt lead
him by <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Lodgings as he paſt
homewards, and he gave this excuſe
to his reaſon, that he wou'd by that
means try the firmneſs of his reſolve,
in paſſing by her Lodgings without
looking once at her Window; Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore down <hi>Bow-ſtreet,</hi> when
he was juſt oppoſite to the Houſe, his
fooliſh wavering fancy ſuggeſted, that
there cou'd be no harm in looking
up to her Window, ſince he believ'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150537:15"/>
ſhe ſtood not there; yet to what
end ſhou'd any reaſonable Man but
a Glaſier look at a Window, when
he expected no body at it. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the leſs caſt up his Eye, and
behold how he was paid for his peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of the dear Caſement which
he only hoped to ſee, he diſcover'd
Monſieur the Captain with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Lac'd Coat ſtanding out of
the Window, and his beloved <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
ſtanding familiarly by him.</p>
            <p>Now for our Sparks Reſolutions,
reaſon would have oblig'd him to
continue them now ſtronger, for he
had a new inſtance of <hi>Emilia</hi>'s falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and of the truth of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
words, but the ſight wrought
a clear contrary effect; he found
himſelf now touch'd in the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part, and the Captains Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
which he could bear when
the Company ſuppos'd them Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to <hi>Selinda,</hi> he could not ſuffer
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150537:16"/>
               <hi>now he found them meant of</hi> Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
Gods (cry'd he out) ſhall I be
outrivali'd by a Fool in the affection
of one as Admirable for her ſenſe as
for her Beauty; tho the Coward durſt
not meet me at the place appointed,
he will certainly reſent an affront in
his Miſtreſſes preſence, which may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
me revenge of both. <hi>Hereupon
he comes to the Door, and opening
it without any Ceremony, comes
madly up, but was met upon the
Stairs by</hi> Emilia; <hi>who running to
him, caught him in her tender Arms,
ſaying.</hi> My dear <hi>Peregrine,</hi> how have
I long'd to ſee You? and what have
I done to Merit this ſtrangeneſs of
Yours? <hi>She went to Kiſs him, but he
hearing a Perſon paſs down Stairs
by him, look'd about, and ſaw it was
only a Porter.</hi> O my deareſt (conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe) I am overjoy'd that you're
come ſo oportunely for my relief; for
I have been peſter'd theſe Five or ſix
Days inceſſantly by my Lord <hi>C—</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:150537:16"/>
who has ſent juſt now to know if I
am at leaſure to receive a viſit. I
ſuppoſe Madam (anſwer'd <hi>Peregrine)</hi>
that you are not at leaſure, for you
have Company above Stairs. None
that ſhall detain me from entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you (replyed ſhe.) Madam, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Peregrine,</hi> you ſhall not prevent
me from entertaining him by all your
Artifices; for by Heavens I'll pull off
his <hi>Lions</hi> Skin, and ſhow the <hi>Aſs</hi> in
his own Colours. Who do you mean
pray Sir (ſaid ſhe) a Coward in the
King's Livery? Madam, your Captain
above. A Captain! replied <hi>Emilia,</hi>
ha, ha, ha, I'll behang'd if you have
not miſtaken my Lord's Footman for
an Officer, ha, ha, ha, a very good
Jeſt, poor <hi>Peregrine,</hi> you have not
rub'd the Sleep out of your Eyes
this Morning. Truly Madam (ſaid
<hi>Peregrine)</hi> your behaviour makes me
doubt that I am Awake. No, no,
(replyed ſhe) you are Dreaming, as
I ſhall convince you; <hi>and leading
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150537:17"/>
him up into her Chamber,</hi> Is this
your Captain? Peregrine <hi>was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amazed to find a very Sheepiſh
Fellow leaning on the Window with
a Lac'd Coat on, which he imagin'd
the Captains. The occaſion of
which Metamorphoſis was this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Porter which <hi>Peregrine</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
the Night before to carry
the Challenge to the Captain, heard
at his Lodgings that the Captain
would not be at home till it was
late, and the poor Fellow being tir'd
with trudging about all Day, and
ſuppoſing it ſufficient to deliver it
in the Morning, went home to his
Reſt, and came accordingly in the
Morning, where he was told by the
Captains Servant, that his Maſter
lay abroad all Night, but that he
had appointed to meet him about
two Hours hence at the Black-poſts
next door to the—in <hi>Bow-ſtreet.</hi>
The Porter accordingly went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and found the Captain in <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:150537:17"/>
Chamber, and had deliver'd
him the Note juſt as <hi>Peregrine</hi> had
look'd up at the Window. At the
ſame inſtant <hi>Emilia</hi> ſpy'd him, and
with great ſurpriſe cryed out. <hi>O
Lord; Sir, I am Ruin'd.</hi> The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
asked what was the matter?
<hi>O (ſaid ſhe) dear Sir, yonder's my
Husband, who has ſeen you, and if
we find not a device to impoſe upon
him, he will Murder me. What ſhall
we do (ſaid the Captain) not all
the Stratagems in the Art Military
can ſave us. But I have one Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
in the Art of Love ſhall do,
ſaid ſhe; Strip, ſtrip, Sir, imediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
change Cloaths with the Porter.</hi>
The Captain very willing to oblige
the Lady, obeyed her Commands,
and equipp'd the Porter immediately,
and puting on the Porters Coat,
Frock, and Apron, ſlunk down Stairs
by <hi>Peregrine</hi> undiſcover'd, leaving
the gawdy Porter in <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
which ſo much occaſioned <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi>'s
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150537:18"/>
wonder. He had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of his Eyes that it was
the Captain but ſome Minutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and now by the ſame Evidence
it appears that it is not he. <hi>This is
all Illuſion (ſaid</hi> Peregrine <hi>in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation.)
Illuſion! (replyed</hi> Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia)
<hi>I little thought that</hi> Peregrine
<hi>could have ſuch ill thoughts of Me,
as to believe I would entertain an
Officer at this Hour in my Chamber.
Truly Madam (anſwered</hi> Peregrine)
<hi>tho Love be blind, I don't think Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy
is ſo, and tho Womens Beauty
depends on our fancy, their Vertue
does not; we rightly can Judge of
that, tho not of tother. Sir (ſaid</hi>
Emilia) <hi>you have never received any
proofs of my immodeſty, tho many of
my Love, and I therefore think it
both ingratitude and injuſtice in you
to tax my Vertue, which you ought
to defend, ſince you are ſenſible it has
held out even againſt you whom I ſo
dearly lov'd, and who (I thought)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150537:18"/>
lov'd me, but I find now too late that I
have been miſtaken;</hi> upon which ſhe
burſt out in Tears. <hi>Go back Sir (ſaid
ſhe to the Porter) and tell your Lord
that I begin to ſuſpect his deſigns upon
me for vicious; alas, I am unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Tricks of this City, and
did not imagine that a Nobleman could
have any baſe deſigns upon a Poor
Womans Honour; go quickly to him, I
ſay, and bid him never trouble me
again, for he has made me already an
unfortunate Woman.</hi> With which
words ſhe Wept moſt bitterly. O
the bewitching Charms of Woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that even their weakneſſes
ſhould conquer our ſtrongeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves!
how eaſily is vain Man
drawn into a belief of his being
belov'd! We take forty Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their indifference or hatred
for effects only of their Modeſty,
but the firſt confeſſion of their Love
we preſently Credit; when, alas,
their profeſſion of the Latter is often
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150537:19"/>
as falſe, as of Former: But what
can't moving Tears of weeping Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
melt. Love in gaiety may take,
but Love in Mourning only truly
wounds. The poor relenting <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine</hi>
fell at her Feet, weeping as
faſt as She.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The ſervent Lover Sigh'd, and
Wept, and Swore,</l>
               <l>That he wou'd ne're diſtruſt her
Vertue more.</l>
               <l>About her Knees he Cling'd with
amorous Bands.</l>
               <l>And preſt his Vows upon her Lips
and Hands.</l>
               <l>She often did her Damon, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
call,</l>
               <l>At laſt with ſullen Cooing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
all.</l>
               <l>He raviſh'd roſe, and Claſpt the
yielding Fair;</l>
               <l>His bounding Joy ſprung higher
from Deſpair.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:150537:19"/>
He Seal'd his Pardon with an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Kiſs,</l>
               <l>If there be Extaſy in Love, 'tis
this.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Behold how ſuddenly the Scheme
is turn'd, the poor deluded <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine</hi>
imagins his Miſtreſs a <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi>
all his former reſolutions are
melted in her Boſom, whilſt ſhe,
innocent creature, murmurs at his
unkindneſs, checking and careſſing
him at the ſame time, to ſhew how
eaſily her Love conquered her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments.
He at laſt left her, and
paſſing out of the Door, eſpied the
Captain in the Porters Habit ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the entrance; he had ſtay'd
there waiting <hi>Peregrin</hi>'s departure,
reſolving upon that to return to
<hi>Emilia,</hi> and with her to Laugh at
the Cuckold, as he imagined him;
who had moſt occaſion to Laugh,
we ſhall find preſently. <hi>Peregrine</hi>
immediately knew the Frock and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150537:20"/>
Cloaths, and the Captain being
of ſomewhat a Porterly ſhape, he
made no doubt but it was the ſame
Fellow he had imployed laſt Night
to carry the Challenge to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and immediately asked how he
had delivered his Meſſage. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ignorant of the matter, could
make no direct anſwer; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing
<hi>Peregrine, Sirrah (ſaid he)
reſolve me inſtantly or I'll break your
Head, Raſcal.</hi> The Officer unuſed to
ſuch words, began to mumble ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſawcily. Upon which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further ceremony, he raps
the poor Captain over the Head
and Shoulders very ſmartly with
his Cane. The Captain roar'd out,
<hi>Bloud and Wounds immediately.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which <hi>Peregrine</hi> redoubled his
ſtroaks and liquor'd his Buff moſt
abundantly, till ſome Gentlemen of
<hi>Peregrine</hi>'s acquaintance took him
off, and carried him to <hi>Wills</hi> Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.
The poor Captain miſerably
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150537:20"/>
beaten, was clear off the Laughing
pin; and coming up ſtairs to <hi>Emilia,</hi>
inquir'd for his Cloaths immediately.
She anſwered, ſhe had ſent the Porter
down ſtairs to him; but the Porter
was no ſuch Fool, for finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo richly Rigged, he ſlipt out
of the back Door, and was never
heard off after. The poor Captain
foam'd and chafed outragiouſly at
theſe abuſes, and went to ſculk
home as ſpeedily as he might, to
equip himſelf in another Suit; he
went through all the blind Alleys
and Lanes that he could, for fear
of meeting any of his acquaintance;
out when he got pretty near his
Lodgings, it was his bad fortune in
one of theſe by-places to paſs by the

Cloaths; her noiſe preſently raiſed
the Mobb, who flocking about the
unfortunate Captain, began to lug
and hale him moſt unſufferably; he
cryed out with a Voice loud enough
to give the Word of Command,
<hi>that he was an Officer, a Captain, &amp;c.</hi>
A mighty Butcher with a ſwell'd
Face of Authority advances, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to ſee his Commiſſion; but that
was gone in the Pocket of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
Waſtcoat. <hi>Some disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Rogue (cryes the Butcher) that's
now forced to live by cutting Throats;
away with him, away with him before
a Magiſtrate.</hi> The poor Captain ran
the Gauntlet moſt wretchedly till
he came to the Houſe of Juſtice
<hi>M—</hi> in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> who upon
the Oath of the Porters Wife, and
ſome of her creditable Neighbours,
drew his Mittimus in order for <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi>
Worſe and worſe! what muſt
poor Buff do? he muſt now diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
himſelf to his Friends for Bail,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150537:21"/>
and ſo be made the Jeſt of the whole
Town; he call'd the Juſtice aſide,
and told him the whole ſtory. The
Magiſtrate anſwered, unleſs the
Porter could be found, that the Law
would oblige him to his Tryal at the
<hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> and that he muſt be bound
over to anſwer at the next Seſſions,
and accordingly he was ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peregrine</hi> loſing a very good Jeſt
by his ignorance in this affair, goes
next Evening to the Play; where
meeting ſome of his ingenious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>W—</hi> Mr.
<hi>H—</hi> Mr. <hi>M—</hi> with others of
that Club, there aroſe a diſcourſe
concerning the Battel between the
Church and the Stage, with relation
to the Champions that mantained
the parties; the reſult upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was this, that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> ſhowed
to much Malice and rancour for a
Church-man, and his Adverſaries too
little wit; for the Character of Poets,
that their faults tranſverſed would
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150537:22"/>
ſhow much better; Dulneſs being
more familiar with thoſe of Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s
Function, as Malice and ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is more adapted to the Profeſſor<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of wit. That the beſt way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> was not to have
replyed at all: for there was ſo much
Fire in his Book, had not his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
thrown in Fuel, it would have
fed upon it ſelf, and ſo have gone
out in a Blaze. As to his reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
that Captain <hi>Va—</hi> wrote
too like a Gentleman to be eſteemed
a good Caſuiſt; that Mr. <hi>C—</hi>'s paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in this buſineſs had blinded his
reaſon, which had ſhone ſo fair in his
other Writings; that Mr. <hi>S—le</hi>
wanted the wit of Captain <hi>Va</hi>—as
much as he did Mr. <hi>Settle</hi>'s gravity;
That the two Anſwers to Mr. <hi>C—</hi>
have done his Book too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but themſelves too great an
Injury: In ſhort, upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that whoever gained the Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory,
the Stage muſt loſe by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150537:22"/>
ſo long the ſeat of the War;
And unleſs Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly</hi>
remove the combuſtion into
the Enemies Country, the <hi>Theatre</hi>
muſt down. And the end of this
War will be attended by caſhicring
the Poets, as the laſt Peace was by
disbanding the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their diſcourſe continued till the
Play began, when</hi> Peregrine <hi>ſpying
his Miſtreſs</hi> Selinda <hi>in a front Box,
was obliged to leave his Friends to
entertain her. This Lady had a
great ſhare of Senſe, and was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
pleaſed with what the Fair Sex
call fine things, which, that Play,
being the</hi> Indian Emperour, <hi>was
plentifully ſtored with.</hi> Peregrine
<hi>was ſo much a Courtier as to Joyn
with her in the Applauſe, but being
of a critical humour, he could not
forbear making ſome ſevere remarks
on the</hi> Dramma, <hi>and inconſiſtencies
of Plots.</hi> You Criticks (ſaid <hi>Selin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da)</hi>
make a mighty ſputter about ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150537:23"/>
of Plot, unity of time, place,
and I know not what, which I can
never find do any Play the leaſt good.
<hi>(Peregrine</hi> ſmild at her Female ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.)
But ſhe continued, I have
one thing to offer in this diſpute, which
I think ſufficient to convince you; I
ſuppoſe the chief deſign of Plays is to
pleaſe the People, and get the Play-Houſe
and Poet a Livelyhood. You
muſt pardon me Madam, (replyed
<hi>Peregrine)</hi> Inſtruction is the buſineſs
of Plays. Sir (ſaid the Lady)
make it the buſineſs of the Audience
Firſt to be pleas'd with Inſtruction,
aud then I ſhall allow you it to be
the chief end of Plays. But ſuppoſe
Madam (ſaid he) that I grant what
you lay down. Then Sir (anſwered ſhe)
you muſt allow that what ever Plays
moſt exactly Anſwer this aforeſaid
end, are the moſt exact Plays. Now
I can inſtance you many Plays, as all
thoſe by <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and
the moſt of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s, which you
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150537:23"/>
Criticks quarrel at as irregular, which
nevertheleſs ſtill continue to pleaſe
the Audience, and are a continual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to the <hi>Theatre;</hi> there's very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of time or place in
any of them, yet they never fail to
Anſwer the propoſed end very ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
Beſides Sir, I have heard your
ſelf ſay, that Poetry is purely an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Nature; what buſineſs then
can Art pretend in the affair? O
Madam, (Anſwered <hi>Peregrine)</hi> this
Art is only the improvement or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Nature, and is us'd in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as Geometrical Lines in Painting
do delineate the peice to an exact
Model or Form. Then certainly (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the Lady) theſe rules are ill
underſtood, or our Nature has chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſince they were made; for we find
they have no ſuch effects now as they
had formerly. For Inſtance, I am told
the <hi>(Double Dealer)</hi> and, <hi>(Plot and
no Plot)</hi> are two very exact Plays, as
you call them, yet all their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150537:24"/>
Time, Place, and Action, neither
pleaſed the Audience, nor got the
Poets Money. A late Play too call'd
<hi>(Beauty in Diſtreſs)</hi> in which the
Author, no doubt, ſweat as much in
confining the whole Play to one Scene,
as the Scene-Drawers ſhould were it to
be changed a hundred times; this
Play had indeed a commendatory Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
from Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> but I think he
had better have altered the Scene,
and pleaſed the Audience; in ſhort
had theſe Plays been a little more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act,
as you call it, they had all been
exactly Damn'd. Peregrine <hi>would
have anſwered, but a pluck by the
Sleeve obliged him to turn from</hi>
Selinda <hi>to entertain a Lady Mask'd,
who had given him the Nudg; he
preſently knew her to be</hi> Emilia,
<hi>who whiſperd him in the Ear,</hi> I find
Sir, what <hi>Guyomar</hi> ſaid juſt now
is very true,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150537:24"/>
               <q>
                  <l>That Love which firſt took Root
will firſt Decay,</l>
                  <l>That of a freſher date, will longer
ſtay.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peregrine,</hi> tho ſurpriſed, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with her pretty Reprimand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivered without any Anger,
but in murmuring complaining Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
which never fail to move;
inſomuch that he could not forbear
demonſtrating his ſatisfaction in ſuch
Terms and Behaviour, as rendered
him remarkable to all about him;
he quite forgot <hi>Selinda,</hi> and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
And ſhe endeavour'd to
forget him by remembring this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his; and tho many ſlips occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by Paſſion are pardonable,
yet when Love cauſes Offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it ſelf in default of good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
towards the Fair, 'tis unexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Had he uſed <hi>Emilia</hi> with that
freedom and careleſneſs which Masks
generally meet with in the Pit, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:150537:25"/>
would have imagined her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
with <hi>Peregrine</hi> to have only
proceeded from a Pert and Impudent
Behaviour, which ſuch Creatures uſe
with all Gentlemen; but he uſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a Fawning and Amorous
reſpect to her, which raiſed <hi>Selinda</hi>'s
Jealouſy to the higheſt pitch. But
this was not all the Miſchief occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the Interview, for my Lord
<hi>C—</hi> had that very Evening made
an Aſſignation with <hi>Emilia</hi> at the
Play, whether ſhe came early; ſhe
beheld <hi>Peregrine</hi> with Indifference
whilſt he taulked among his Friends,
nor had ſhe the leaſt Motion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
her ſelf to him; but ſpying
him addreſſing a fine Lady in the
Box, whom ſhe perceived to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him with more then ordinary
Civility, ſhe felt a violent Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to interrupt him; She found
by the Ladies freedom and gayety
in Diſcourſe, that ſhe was fond of
<hi>Peregrine</hi>'s converſation, and out of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150537:25"/>
a pure malicious deſign would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
her of it; She accompliſh'd
her deſign, <hi>Peregrine</hi> paid her an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
reſpect, and ſhe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it with as much civility, purely
to raiſe <hi>Selinda</hi>'s Jealouſy, whom ſhe
had now remembred to have ſeen
twice with <hi>Peregrine;</hi> but the Poor
Lady was caught in her own Net;
for at the Inſtant of her greateſt
freedom with <hi>Peregrine,</hi> my Lord
diſcover'd her. He is the moſt Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Amouriſt in <hi>England,</hi> and to one
of his temper, he ſaw enough to
raiſe a diſtruſt of his Miſtreſſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion:
Coming cloſe up to her, he
Whiſperd her, <hi>Madam, I am as good
as my Appointment, but finding you
better employed, I ſhan't be ſo rude
as to interrupt you.</hi> Upon which ſhe
preſently turn'd from <hi>Peregrine</hi> to
my Lord. Hey, paſs, the Tides
turned, and poor <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s left upon
the Sand; nay the Wind's turn'd too,
for looking at <hi>Selinda</hi> he could ſee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150537:26"/>
nothing but Storm and Tempeſt in
her Brow. But he alone was not
Shipwrackt, for poor <hi>Emilia</hi> ran the
ſame fate; for ſhe entertained my
Lord with that earneſtneſs, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
how familiar ſhe was ſtill with
his Lordſhip, which gave <hi>Peregrine</hi> a
new proof of her falſhood, but was
not ſufficient to convince my Lord
of her Integrity, ſo that the reſult
upon the tranſactions of this Evening,
was, that <hi>Selinda</hi> through Jealouſy
of the Mask'd Lady had diſcarded
<hi>Peregrine;</hi> He Jealous of my Lord
<hi>C—</hi> had forſaken <hi>Emilia;</hi> and ſhe
by her familiarity with <hi>Peregrine</hi>
is deſerted by his Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>But above all, <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s trouble
was much the greateſt; he had loſt
the hopes of amending his Fortune
by Marrying a vertuous Lady, and
one whom he might reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Lov'd him, and all through
the means of a Perſon who ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
had abuſed his paſſion. A re-
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150537:26"/>
on the Weakneſs of his temper in not
ſticking to his reſolutions, was no
ſmall affliction; but above all, the
falſhood of his <hi>Emilia</hi> occaſioned his
diſtraction; he went to bed, hoping
there to find that reſt which his
waking thoughts denied.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Nights black Curtain o're the

ſuch deſigns had been ſo often bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

roſe fully reſolved for the Country
that Morning, hoping, that diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of Company might wear off his
trouble occaſioned by the City con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
He was juſt ſending to

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150537:29"/>
when a Meſſenger brought
him a Letter; which he opening,
was ſurpriſed to find come from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia;</hi>
he expected to find it full of
Recantations and Excuſes for her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
with my Lord <hi>C—</hi> and
ſlighting him the Night before at
the Play; but before he would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to read the Charm, he thought
it convenient to ſay his Prayers in
the following Words:
<q>
                  <l>From Wit couch'd in Nonſenſe,
which blinds all that Read,</l>
                  <l>From conjuring Scrawls which like
Magick invade,</l>
                  <l>From words ſpelt as Falſe as the

            </p>
            <p>Then fully reſolved to account all

He quite forgot all thoughts of her
Falſhood to deplore her Neceſſity,
and the Scantineſs of his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that confin'd him from relieving
her. A fooliſh nicety of Honour
ſuggeſted to him, that if he now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
her, ſhe would attribute his
unkindneſs not to any fault of Hers,
but reckon it a poor pretence for
evading her Requeſt. Here was an
Inſtance of Female policy, here was
a Stratagem to recover a loſt Lover,
that (I believe) the moſt intreague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Devil could never ſuggeſt to
contriving Woman before. She was
afraid that his Love was ſo ſhocked
by her behaviour, that ſhe could not
build a Reconciliation upon that;
and therefore reſolv'd to draw his
Honour in, to make up the breach,
being conſcious that Ingenious Men
are as fruitful in diſcovering Niceties
in that, as Beauties in their Miſtreſs,
and ſometimes as much to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150537:30"/>
But the depth of her Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
went yet further, as ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
appear.</p>
            <p>Peregrine <hi>diſmiſt the Meſſenger
with this Anſwer, That he would
wait on the Lady imediately; and
preſently after, in his Riding ſuit,
he went to her Lodgings, poſitively
reſolved to give her what Money
he could ſpare, then upbraid her for
her Falſhood, and ſo take his laſt
farewell. He found her in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
ſitting on her Beds-feet in a
very Melancholy poſture; her Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown
careleſly looſe diſcovered her
Snowy Breaſt, which Agitated by
the violence of her Sighs, heaved
and fell with a moſt Languiſhing
motion; her Eyes were fixt on the
Ground, and without regarding</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine,
<hi>ſhe raiſed her Voice in a
Mournful and moving ſweetneſs, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
Fool, Fool, that conſidered not
when I was well, <hi>concluding which
with a deep Sigh, ſhe caſt a complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:150537:31"/>
Look on</hi> Peregrine, <hi>intimating
that he alone had occaſioned her Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.
He beheld thoſe enticing
Beauties, that too well knew the way
to his Heart; He beheld the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Charms of Female Sorrow, art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
expreſs'd in a careleſs Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly;
and to all this, he heard that
tuneful ſtart of Grief which made
his raviſhed Soul ſtrike Uniſon with
the complaining Harmony. Let
thoſe who have ever felt the pleaſing
follies of Love, now gueſs at our
Lovers thoughts. Such will Pardon
his weakneſs, being conſcious of the
force of ſo many united Charms. He
begged to know the Cauſe of her
great Grief, making all poteſtations
(that Paſſion could ſuggeſt) of uſing
his utmoſt endeavours in relieving
her.</hi> Alas <hi>Peregrine</hi> (anſwered ſhe)
my Misfortunes are many, and all
proceeding from ſo Dear an occaſion,
that I could wiſh them to continue, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than think the Cauſe ſhould ceaſe.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150537:31"/>
In ſhort, (continued ſhe Weeping) my
Paſſion for you has drawn me into a
neceſſity of being troubleſom to one
whoſe kindneſs will perhaps flow from
a Principle of Charity, not Love. But
Sir, (I ſcorn to be pitied; and if I
can't merit your Eſteem, I diſdain
to be an Object of your Compaſſion.
Madam (replied he) my Charity may
extend to ſhare Superfluities, but no
leſs motive then Love could engage
me thus to diſtribute my neceſſaries.
<hi>upon which he gave her Ten</hi> Guineas,
<hi>leaving himſelf but One.</hi> Well, my
dear <hi>Peregrine</hi> (ſays ſhe) I am too
ſenſible of the unhappineſs of your Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
and will therefore Treſpaſs
no further upon them: You ſhall only
ſpare me ſome of your Love to lay out
upon Another, and that ſhall pay the
Ranſom for your Money. <hi>Peregrine</hi>
was ſtrangely ſurpriſed at her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe!
Be not ſtartled, Sir, (ſaid
ſhe) for a Proof of your Affection it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150537:32"/>
muſt be ſo; I have long been Solicited
by my Lord <hi>C—</hi> and have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſome Preſents from Him, and
was in a fair way of Commanding what
I pleaſed, had not my unlucky kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to you at the Play laſt Night
raiſed his Jealoſy to that Degree,
that he has forſaken me Now, Sir,
ſince your circumſtances debar you from
recompencing the loſs, I think you are
obliged to be Inſtrumental to Me in
recovering his Affection; but do not
think (my Deareſt) that he can ever
deſtroy your Intereſt in my Heart, but
rather heighten it, being a means to
ſupport that Love which the ſcanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of your Fortune would Starve.
<hi>Very reaſonable Arguments to make</hi>
Peregrine <hi>a downright Pimp! He was
ſtrangely Netled, but being reſolv'd
to ſee the Utmoſt.</hi> How Madam (ſaid
he) can I be Inſtrumental in your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with his Lordſhip? Only
thus (Replied ſhe) you muſt know
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150537:32"/>
he is wonderfully Charmed with Wit
and Writing fine, in a Woman; now
I am ſenſible you have an Excellent Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in Epiſtolary Stile, (which I muſt
ſtill remember ſince firſt your Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Letters conquered me;) you muſt
therefore write an Ingenious Letter
for me, which I will Tranſcribe, and
ſend to his Lordſhip, which will In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
reclaim him. But ſuppoſe
Madam (ſaid <hi>Peregrine)</hi> that my
Lord diſcovers the difference of Stile
if you Write to him again? No, no
(ſaid ſhe) you ſhall Anſwer all my
Lords Letters for me. Peregrine
<hi>immediately conceiving, that by this
means he ſhould ſee my Lord</hi> C—'s
Letters, and thereby diſcover if the
Intreague went any further then he
would have it, undertook the Task,
and wrote a Letter which wrought
the deſired effect.</p>
            <p>My Lord was already captivated
by <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Beauty, but was not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150537:33"/>
Lover enough to think the Nonſenſe
of a Miſtreſs, Wit; but this Letter,
full of Paſſion and Ingenuity, fir'd him,
he found what he ſo admired in a
Lady, there expreſſed in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and immediately came to wait
upon her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By this time</hi> Peregrine, <hi>much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
by the Odneſs of this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had departed; and</hi> Emilia <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his Lordſhip in a contrary
Humour to what ſhe had ſhown to</hi>
Peregrine, <hi>entertaining him with all
the gayety and briskneſs imaginable.
My Lord not abating of his Jealous
Humour, deſired to know whom ſhe
entertained ſo freely at the Play.</hi>
'Tis a Creature, my Lord, (replyed
ſhe) called a neceſſary Lover. I have
often heard (ſaid he) of a neceſſary
Animal called a Husband, but never
of a neceſſary Lover before. Such, my
Lord, (ſaid ſhe) are of the ſame
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150537:33"/>
uſe to us, as a Husband to a Wife,
to cover all our Faults. They defend
our Honours in all Company, being
poſſeſſed of a good Opinion of our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
which Opinion once Eſtabliſhed, we
take all care to Improve. Methinks
(anſwered he) your freedom with that
Gentleman were enough to deſtroy that
good Opinion, if he entertained any
ſuch before. No, my Lord ſaid ſhe)
theſe are the Arts by which we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them; for granting them all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Freedoms and Incouragment
without the leaſt Favour, makes them
ſet a favourable conſtruction upon ſuch
our Behaviour with others, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
them to believe all Stories prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to our Reputation rather the effects
of Mens Vanity, than our kindneſs:
Beſides, being once drawn into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of their being beloved by us,
their Vanity ſuggeſts, that ſince we are
Vertuous in reſpect of them, we muſt
certainly be ſo in regard of thoſe that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150537:34"/>
are more indifferent to us. But that
Gentleman, (Anſwered my Lord) if
I am not Miſinformed in his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
has too much Senſe to be made
ſuch a Tool of. Only Ingenious Men
(anſwered ſhe) are fit for our purpoſe,
becauſe ſuch Perſons are only able to
Nouriſh a Paſſion without Enjoyment;
<hi>Secondly,</hi> being conſcious of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
they imagine our Love very real
becauſe of the worthineſs of the
Object; <hi>And Laſtly,</hi> being the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of the Age, their words are
taken among their Friends, and our
Reputation thus Eſtabliſh'd. <hi>My
Lord</hi> C—<hi>was Amazed at this
open Confeſſion of cunning, which
he had never diſcovered in the Sex
before; and leſt ſhe ſhould make
the ſame Fool of him, he preſſed
hard for a Proof of the contrary,
which I believe ſhe granted, for he
continued his Viſits with great Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:150537:34"/>
               <hi>Peregrine</hi> all this while continued
to Serve her with his Pen, and was
very fond of Anſwering my Lords
Letters, becauſe he found them very
Witty and Paſſionate; and having
a good memory at retaining what
pleaſed him, he generally by once
or twice peruſing, cou'd remember
them, <hi>verbatim;</hi> and conſtantly when
he left <hi>Emilia,</hi> would write them
down, together with the Anſwers
very diſtinctly, with which he uſed
to divert himſelf very often; for he
found ſo much reſpect in all my
Lords Letters, that he could not
ſuppoſe his Lordſhip had made any
Advances beyond him. But <hi>Emilia</hi>
had forewarned my Lord of making
the leaſt mention of any her Favours,
leſt the Letter might Miſcarry, and
fall into Hands that might Publiſh
her ſhame. By which Artifice ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd,
ſhe continued her ingenious
Correſpondence with my Lord, which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150537:35"/>
more and more engaged his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
without giving <hi>Peregrine</hi> any
reſonable grounds of Jealoſy. He
often preſſed for a Conſummation
of his Happineſs; but ſhe ſticking to
her Principles, tantalized him with
Careſſes and Proteſtations of her
Love, and never wanted a Pretence for
delay, until unfortunately ſhe loſt
Him and her Self on the following
Occaſion.</p>
            <p>One Morning three or four Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the Law, <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
came running into his
Chamber, and asked him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
them to the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> to hear
the Tryal. What Tryal (anſwered
he? Why, the famous Tryal of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—who
is Arraigned for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
a Porter. This was News
to him, and he went with them.
The Indictment was Read, and the
Tryal come on before they reach'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150537:35"/>
the Court; <hi>Peregrine</hi> was ſtrangely
ſurpris'd to hear <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Voice at
the Bar, and diſtruſting the truth of his
Ears, cou'd not be ſatisfied till he ſaw
her; She was Summon'd as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for the Captain, where upon
her Oath ſhe was forced to declare
how ſhe made the Captain change
Cloaths with the Porter in her
Chamber, how ſhe ſent him down
Stairs in the Porters Habit, and how
the Porter had gone off with His;
in ſhort, the whole Story, with all the
Circumſtances of the Intreague, was
diſcovered before the whole Court,
and in <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s hearing; who now
fully Convicted of the Treachery
of his Miſtreſs by her own Oath, has
once more put on firm Reſolutions
of ever forſaking her; and that he
may draw my Lord <hi>C—</hi> out of
the ſame Errour, he has given a
Copy of all my Lords Letter's and
their Anſwers to a Friend of his, who
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150537:36"/>
immediately deſigns to publiſh a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Letters, where his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
may read his own Wit, and
the Falſhood of <hi>Emilia.</hi>
