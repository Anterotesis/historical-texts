            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DECLARATION
Of his Excellency Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Warre, on behalfe of themſelves and the whole Army,
ſhewing the grounds of their preſent advance towards
the City of LONDON.</head>
            <p>WHen this Army was formerly led, by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
diſpenſations of Gods providence, and the
grounds then declared to advance towards the
City of London, wee held it our duty to yeeld
the Kingdome the ſome of theſe deſires, which
we had to propoſe, on behalfe of it and our
ſelves, where in we ſhould acquieſſe: And having received from the
Parliament ſome hopes of due ſatisfaction therein, and ſome aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the Lord Maior, Aldermen, and Common-councell of
the City of London, of their ready concurrance with us in thoſe
things: And alſo great reſolutions profeſſed by them of their care
and tenderneſſe, to preſerve all the rights and priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſafe. free, and inviolate from attempts of all kinds; wee doe
appeale to Cod, to the City, and to all men, what a ſpeedy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
their deſires for our removall to a further diſtance found
in this Army: For preventing all feares, ielouſies, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
to the City, and to give cleere teſtimony that we had
nothing in our breſts but thoughts of peace, and the good and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
both of Parliament, City and Kingdome; notwithſtanding
many falce and ſcandalous reports raiſed, that we ſaught our ſelves,
that wee had vile and wicked ends, and that nothing would ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Souldiers but the plunder of the City, and contrary whereof
did manifeſtly appeare, when they ſo readily marched back upon
hopes of ſatisfaction in their deſires of publike concernment.</p>
            <p>Having then upon the aforeſaid confidence ſo with-drawne, and
out of a iuſt ſenſe of the Countries ſuffering (by quartering) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58827:3"/>
the head quarter of the Army above forty miles from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and diſperſed the reſt well nigh two hundred miles, for the
more eaſe of all partes; and that we might give the better ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Kingdome; and being in this ſecure way, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after the ſudden ſettlement of the Kingdome, we had even
brought to perfection the particular propoſals, (included in the
generals of our firſt Repreſentation) to be ſent to the Parliament
for a finall concluſion of all our troubles; and alſo had made good
progreſſe towards the preſent reliefe of diſtreſſed Ireland, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
a competent force both of horſe and foote forthwith to
have advanced for that ſervice.</p>
            <p>But the Kingdomes and our enemies being moſt vigilent and
active to prevent and fruſtrate thoſe good intentions and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of ours (that they might carry on their former evil deſignes,
and underhand practices, &amp; alſo preſerve themſelves from the hands
of Juſtice) they have endeavoured to caſt the Kingdome into a new
and bloudy warre, and for that end have procured the under-hand
liſting of ſeverall Reformadoes and others: Have contrived, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted,
and cauſed to be entred into by ſeverall perſons, a wicked
and treaſonable combination, as is ſufficiently manifeſted by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
paſſed thereupon by both Houſes of Parliement the three
and twenteth of July laſt, for prevenſion of the diſturbances that
were like to enſue thereupon: From which kind of diſorders, the
City had bin well preſerved during the ſpace of almoſt four yeares,
whileſt the Militia was in the hands of the old Commiſſioners)
wereby it appears there was cauſe for the Army to intreat the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
that the Militia might be returned into the hands it was
in before, as alſo for divers other good reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the old Commiſſioners of the Militia (that have been
ſince left out) were not only perſons without all exception, having
beene formerly choſen and approved by the Parliament, and City,
but alſo men of whom the City, Parliament and Kingdome, have
had above four yeares experience in the faithfull diſcharge of their
truſt; men that ever from the beginning, in the worſt of times, and
in the occaſions of greateſt difficulty, had faithfully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ingaged for and with the Parliament in this cauſe:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58827:3"/>
Men that were alwayes moſt deſirous of peace, but of a ſafe and
well grounded one, and that had alwayes teſtified a great <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are to
prevent all occaſions of embroyling the Kingdome in a new War;
Now that on a ſuddaine this Truſt which they had faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
ſo long, ſhould be taken out of their hands, and put into the
hands of others, ſome whereof (at the beſt) have beene very coole
in the ſervice of the Parliament at the beginning of this War; That
this ſhould be preſſed, and in a manner forced upon the Parliament,
with ſuch importunity from the Common Councell, that ſome out
of every Ward ſhould be appointed to ſollicite the Members of the
Houſe of Commons every day as they went in and out at the
Houſe, with Profeſſions, that they would never leave the doore of
the Houſe, till they were ſatisfied in their deſires; That they would
not be contented with the Militia of the City of London onely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they might have power over that of the Suburbs and outparts;
and all this before the peace of the Kingdome was ſetled, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
ſent to the King for that purpoſe. Theſe things miniſtred
great cauſe of ſuſpicion, that this alteration of the Militia was in
order to a deſigne, and to make the tearmes of the peace and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the King (on which the ſecurity of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and their poſterity is to be bottomed) more ſutable to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
bargainings and undertakings of ſome men, then to the publick
welfare of the whole Kingdome in its ſecurity and proſperity, for
the preſent and in future times. But this Deſigne diſcovered it ſelfe
more clearely by ſuch things as accompanied the purſuite of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the Militia, and enſued upon the obtaining thereof; At
the ſame time that the alteration of the Militia was ſet on foot, the
ſame perſons with as much earneſtneſſe preſſed for the disbanding
of this Army, before any thing was ſetled for the ſecurity and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Kingdome. At the ſame time the Common Councell was
new modell'd, and a Lord Major choſen that might ſuite with the
preſent Deſigne in hand; At the ſame time (in colour of difference<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in ſome circumſtances of Church Government) it was earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
that ſuch as had beene conſtantly true and moſt faithfull
to the intereſt of this Kingdome, ſhould be diſabled to have any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in Church or Commonwealth either in England or Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
And without any ſuch colour or pretence, divers perſons were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58827:4"/>
left out of the Common Councell, and Militia, of eminent deſe<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
and fidelity, and others brought into their roomes, that had either
teſtified an ill <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffection, or little <gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffection to the Parliament and their
Cauſe; And ſuch as ſeemed to withdraw themſelves from all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in the beginning of this warre, now at the winding up
thereof, are ambitious to thruſt themſelves into employments, with
a Deſigne (as may juſtly be ſuſpected) to fruſtrate and overthrow
and overthrow in the Cloſe of all the fruit and effect of all the coſt
and bloud that hath been ſpent and ſpilt in this Cauſe. And after that
with difficulty, and not without reluctancy in the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they had obtained the power of the Militia in the City of
London, and alſo in the outparts for the ſpace of one yeare: Many
cheife Officers and under Officers in the Trained bands of knowne
truſt and fidelity were diſplaced, and others of more doubtfull affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
placed in their roomes; little eare was taken of the honour of
the Parliament, which was continually trampled under foot, and
their authority affronted by every rabble of Women, Apprentices,
Reformadoes &amp; ſouldiers; which latter ſort of perſons were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſo encouraged to riſe higher and higher in their tumultuous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
againſt the Houſes, till at length it is riſen to the height of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and monſtrous violence againſt the Parliament, that they
might ſet themſelves on workes, and the Kingdome on fire againe:
And now at length the Deſigne appeares open faced, and though
the Militia be made as the principall ground of the quarrell, yet by
the late vow and engagement ſet on foot before any alteration of
the Militia; and the preſſing ſo much the Meſſage of the 12 of May,
and the Kings comming to London to confirme the ſame, ſhew, that
the Militia is deſired but in order to that Deſigne, and to force the
Parliament (being wholly in their power) to ſuch tearmes of peace
as they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>In the next place, when the intereſt of the Common Councell in
their change of the Militia ſhall be claimed as the birthright of the
City of London (which they never had any colour to pretend to)
ſwing by the indulgency of the Parliament unto them ſince this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
in reſpect of the great uſe they have had of them, and the
many good ſervites they have received from them) it is time for all
the Kingdome to looke to their Birthrights, if ſuch a claime ſhall be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58827:4"/>
help up againſt both Houſes of Parliament: That upon no occaſion
whatſoever, nor in no time of danger and diſtraction whatſoever,
they may appoint theſe that ſhall have the power of the Militia of
London without the conſent of the Common Councell eſpecially,
when as the Houſes ſhall ſit under their power; The late example
may evidence to all the world who ſhall be Maſters of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
freedome and reſolutions: And Common Reaſon will teach
every man who ſhall be Maſters of their Birthrights of the whole
Kingdome, when there ſhall be no Army on foot, when they have
the confidence to diſpute for the Maſtery, notwithſtanding ſuch an
an Army as this to check and ballance them in behalfe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Parliament.</p>
            <p>Laſtly. The Army diſcerning how intimate ſome of the new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
were with ſome of the eleven accuſed Members; how forward
they were to comply and act with them in their endeavours to raiſe
a new a new Warre; how they made eighteene or nineteene votes
in order thereunto together with them, in one night; All which the
Common Councell and Parliament diſliked and revoked, how not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they ſecretly promoted their Deſignes by private
Liſtings, which now appeares to have beene ſtill working under
ground.</p>
            <p>The Army, we ſay, obſerving this, and having nothing more in
their thoughts &amp; deſires, then to ſettle a ſpeedy ſafe and well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
peace, and to prevent a new War, found it neceſſary to deſire,
that the Militia might be put into the hands wherein it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who had approved themſelves both to the Army, Parliament, and
Kingdome, to be ſober minded men, and not given to any practices
whereby a new Warre might be kindled; to the intent, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
being ſecured by that meanes from that danger, might with the
more confidence retire farther from the City: inlarge their Quarter
for the greater eaſe of the Kingdome: and intend wholly the ſetling
of a ſure peace in this Kingdome, and a ſpeedy and effectuall reliefe
of Ireland; which was almoſt brought to a period, and nothing in
the ſight of man could have hinder'd, but the curſed violence upon
the Parliament under pretence of the Militia; which according to
our deſire being reſtored againe into the hands of the Old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners
by an Ordinance of both Houſes dated July the 23. (in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58827:5"/>
of the aforeſaid reaſonable combination) ſeverall Petitions
were preſented to the Common Councell and City of London in
the name of the Apprentices and others, importing their deſires,
That the Militia of the City might continue in the hands of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Commoners according to the Ordinance of the 4 of May laſt.
Whereupon Monday July the 26. the Common Councell of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
preſents their petitions to both Houſes for changing the Militia;
wherein the Houſe of Lords refuſe to alter their reſolutions, the
Houſe of Commons anſwered they would take it into conſideration
the next morning; Notwithſtanding which, the City and Kingdome
cannot be ignorant with what rage and inſolency the tumult of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
the ſame day forced both Houſes; They blocked up their
doores; ſwearing they would keepe them in till they had paſſed
what votes they pleaſed. They threatned the Houſes if they gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not their deſires: knocking, hooting and hollowing ſo at the
Parliament doores, that many times the Members could not be heard
to ſpeake or debate; not ſuffering the Houſe of Commons to divide
for determining ſuch queſtions as were put, crying out that thoſe
that gave their votes againſt them ſhould be ſent out to them; very
often and loudly crying, Agree, Agree, Diſpatch, wee'l waite no
longer; and in this outragious manner they continued at the Houſe
above eight houres together, the City guards there preſent, nor the
City releiving them; by reaſon wherof the Houſe was forced to
vote what that rude multitude would demand, and then adjourned
the Houſe till the next morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After which the Speaker riſing, the
Speaker and many of the Members going out of the Houſe, they
force them backe againe into the Houſe; many of the Apprentices
preſſing in with them, where they ſtood with their hats on their
heads, and compell'd the Speaker to take the Chaire, and the Houſe
to vote in their preſence what they pleaſed, committing many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſolencies, as is publiſhed by the Speaker of the Houſe of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

And during the time of this excerable violence done by the ſaid
Apprentices, Weſtminſter Hall, and the Pallace yard was fils'd with
Reformadoes, and other ill-affected perſons deſigned to back them.
After this the Houſes being adjourned till Friday following, upon
the Thurſday the Apprentices printed, and poſted a paper in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

places of the City, requiring all their fellowes to be early at the
Parliament the next morning, for that they intended to adjourne by
ſeaven of the clock, and that for a Month.</p>
            <p>Thus the Speakers with many of the Members of both Houſes were
driven away from the Parliament.</p>
            <p>This being the true ſtate of things as they have broke forth within
theſe few daies, (which are ſo contrary to all thoſe pretences of Peace,
and deteſtation of a new Warre of late ſo frequently held forth on all
ſides) all men may obſerve to what maturity the long projected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of ſome men, (of whom are thoſe that are impeached by us) is
now brought and may be traced in the ſeverall ſteps thereof, as it hath
tended to the inſlaving this Kingdome, and the deſtruction of all ſuch
well-aff<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cted people, who would not comply with them therein; ſo
as by what now is come to light the juſtneſſe of that Cauſe this Army
had engaged themſelves in, and the great and wonderfull Mercy of
God, in continuing them together, we aſſure our ſelves doth now
clearly appeare, to all mens eyes and apprehenſions, and will every
day more and more be acknowledged, even by thoſe that have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made a queſtion of it.</p>
            <p>And if when this Kingdome hath ſpent ſo much of it's bloud and
Treaſure, hath paſt through ſuch unheard of dangers, and overcome
ſuch Difficulties, ſo many years together, All that they muſt now hope
for, and reſt in, muſt only be what the King grants in his Meſſage of the
12. of <hi>May</hi> laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if this muſt be impoſed upon mens judgements
and Conſciences by an Oath and vow, entred into in a tumultuous and
unlawfull way, and by outrage maintained in deſpight and contempt
of the Parliament: If rather then this ſhould not be accompliſhed, the

               </gap>nt it ſelfe muſt be violated and forced into the hands of ſuch
of the Members thereof, as have ſecretly fomented and abetted theſe
practiſes to that end, That theſe hidden Councells, and workes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
might, when they come to their full birth, have the Image of
higheſt authority in the face of them, the better to gaine credit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cure the Authors of them from puniſhment; For the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of all which, we referre our ſelves to the particulars in our
charge againſt the eleaven Members, compared with thoſe paſſages of
late broke forth, before rehearſt: Vnto which we ſhall now only adde,
(and leave it to the conſideration of all wiſe and good men) with what
Artifice and boldneſſe theſe Members have ſerv'd themſelves of thoſe
horrid tumults and violences of their own creating, (in ſtead of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their deteſtation of them) again to intrude themſelves into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58827:6"/>
mannaging of affaires, and inevitably to embroyle the Kingdome
in a new Warre: which their own revenge, and the compaſſing of
their former plots and deſignes makes them ſo greedily thirſt after. If
theſe things (we ſay,) muſt be the end and upſhot of all, what then
remaines to this poore Kingdome, and all true hearted Engliſhmen, but
to joyne together as one man with their Counſells, Eſtates, and Lives
in this way, as our laſt refuge under God: which he by his wiſe and
gratious providence hath provided and reſerved, and keeping up this
Army even to a Miracle, ſo to prevent the aforeſaid evills, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to this dying Kingdome, yet a ſetled Peace and happineſſe if it be
his bleſſed will?</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſeriouſly conſidered by us, wee have thought
fit in the name of the Army to declare, that all ſuch Members
of either, Houſe of Parliament, as are already with the Army, or
for the ſecuring of their Perſons, and for the ends aforeſaid, are
forced to abſent themſelves from Weſtminſter, that wee ſhall
hold and eſteeme them, as Perſons in whom the publique truſt of
the Kingdome is ſtill remaining, though they cannot for the preſent
fit as a Parliament with freedom and ſafety at <hi>Weſtminster:</hi> And by
whoſe advice and Counſels we deſire to governe our ſelves, in the
managing theſe weighty affaires: And to that end we invite them to
make repaire to this Army, to ioyne with us in this great Cauſe, we
being reſolved; and doe hereby faithfully obleige our ſelves to ſtand
by them therein, and to live and die with them againſt all oppoſition
whatſoever. And in particular, we doe hold our ſelves bound to owne
that honorable Act of the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the grounds he himſelfe expreſſed in his Declaration ſent unto us,
hath actually withdrawn himſelfe; And hereupon we doe further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
to uſe our utmoſt and ſpeedy indeavours, that he and thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of either Houſe that are thus inforced away from their attendance
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> may with freedom and ſecurity ſit there, and again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their truſt as a free and legall Parliament. And in the meane
time, we doe declare againſt that late choyce of a New Speaker by
ſome Gentlemen at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> as contrary to all Right, Reaſon, Law,
and Cuſtome; And we profeſſe our ſelves to be moſt clearly ſatisfied
in our Iudgments, and are alſo confident, the Kingdom will herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
with us, that as things now ſtand there is no free nor legall Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
ſitting, being through the aforeſaid violence at preſent ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And that the Orders, Votes, or Reſolutions forced from the Houſes
on Munday the 26, of <hi>July</hi> laſt, as alſo all ſuch as ſhall paſſe in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58827:6"/>
of ſome few Lords and Gentlemen at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> under what
pretence and colour ſoever are void and null, and ought not to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to by the freeborne Subiects of England: And that we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
that ſlavery deſigned upon us and the Nation, and that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
may be reſtored to the happy ſtate of a viſible Government now
Ecclypſed and darkened, we hold our ſelves bound by our duty to God
and the Kingdom, to bring to condigne puniſhment the Authors and
promoters of that unparaleld violence, done to the Parliament, and in
that to all the freeborne Subiects of England, that are or hereafter ſhall
be; And therefore we are reſolved to march up towards London,
where we doe expect that the welaffected people of that City, will
deliver up unto us, (or otherwiſe put into ſafe Cuſtody, ſo as they may
be referred to a legall Triall) the eleven impeached Members, that
have again thruſt themſelves into the management of publicke affaires
by this wicked Deſigne; And that all others will give us ſuch aſſiſtance
therein that the Members of both Houſes may receive due incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to returne to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> there to ſit with all freedome, and ſo
to performe their truſt, as ſhall conduce to the ſettlement of this diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Kingdom; And to inflict ſuch puniſhment upon thoſe late Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
as ſhall deterre any for the future to make the like attempt.</p>
            <p>We appeale to all the Kingdom, if we have not had a very tender care
of the City of <hi>London,</hi> there Commiſſioners will witneſſe it; Our
lives have not bin deare unto us for the publique good; And being now
reſolved by the aſſiſtance of God to bring theſe Delinquents to their
deſerved puniſhment as that, then which there cannot be any thing of
more publike concernment to the Kingdom, we truſt (if it ſhall come
to that) our blood ſhall not be accounted too deare a price for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of it; And if any in the City will engage themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us to pretect thoſe perſons, and ſo put the Kingdom againe into
a new and miſerable Warre, the Blood muſt be laid to the Account of
ſuch perſons as the Authors thereof.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, becauſe it is the main Engine, of ours and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
enemie, to render us odious, by poſſeſſing the minds of men that
we gape only after the plunder of this Great and wealthy Citty: As
the experience of the contrary carriage in all Townes, that we have
taken, yeeldeth unto us a Teſtimony beyond the example of any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
ſo we doe from our hearts declare, that we abhorre the
thought thereof: And we doubt not but the World ſhall ſee our actions
anſwerable to our profeſſions, and that we ſhall not cauſe any man to
ſuffer but by his own default, And that God will manifeſt, we have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58827:7"/>
in our eyes that juſtice may have a free courſe, the Parliament a free
Sitting and Voting, and a full vindication of the late violence done to
them.</p>
            <p>And as for the Citty of Weſtminſter, the Borough of Southwarke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Hamlets, and the reſt of the Suburbs and out Parts, as we are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
That they are not ſo ready to ingage themſelves in a new Warre
as ſome would have them, ſo we are ſenſible of the hard condition that
they are brought into, even by them that claime a Right againſt both
