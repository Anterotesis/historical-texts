            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PRESBYTERY! the very Name implies Age and Gravity, therefore not to be expoſed to the Obloquie of more Green and Frothy Wits, that are employ'd in Reviling this Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Faction; whereas Reverence ought to be given to the Gray Head, according to Merit, which is not to be Buffoon'd and Flurted at by every young Fop, who has not Phlegm enough to allay his Gall, nor Diſcretion ſufficient to check his Hot-headed Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their full Career: Nay, the word Puritan, a Nick-name God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father'd on them by ſome of our ſcoffing <hi>Shimei</hi>'s, and <hi>Rakehel Rabſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keh</hi>'s, implies in its genuine ſignification, no other than Purity; Like the Cathariſts of Old, who pretended to be more Sanctimonious than the reſt of their Brethren, free from wilful Sin, tho ſometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Humane Frailties and Immoralities, and thoſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Notorious, as you ſhall underſtand by this enſuing Character.</p>
            <p>As for the common Name of <hi>Phanatic,</hi> it is the Appellative of all Diſſenters from our Holy Mother the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not to be Appropriated ſolely to them: but he that denies it to any Faction, deſerves to be Caged up in that ſtately Structure in <hi>Moorfields,</hi> as much as any Lunatic that ever was confin'd thereto, ſince its Original Erection. But to return to the Matter in hand; if you take into your Serious Conſideration the enſuing Character of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54350:3"/>
I preſume it will rince out all the Stains they have been Tainted with, and wipe away all thoſe Opprobrious Calumnies they have been be-ſpatter'd with by ſome Black-mouth'd Buffoons. In ſhort, take it as followeth: A <hi>Presbyter</hi> is a Perſon that Inveighs againſt Debauchery in General, and Thunders out <hi>Anathema</hi>'s in a very Nonſenſical Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue againſt Drinking, Whoring and Swearing; but for Diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Hypocriſie, and Lying, <hi>Belzebub</hi> is not able to out-do him: And as I have heard it from one of the Rabbies of the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Sanhedrim, if there be one Place in Hell hotter than the other, that is the Portion of the Hypocrite; but I leave the Reader to make Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He's a Man that always appears with a writh'd Cloſe-ſtool Face, and makes ſuch Grimaces, that you muſt needs think him to be on the <hi>Jakes,</hi> ſtrain'd by the Operation of a ſmart Cathartic; ſo that it may be ſaid of him more truly than it was of one of the Roman Emporors, <hi>Ingenium male habitat.</hi> His Wit (if any) is ill lodg'd, his Soul is couch'd in a very Crabbed and Untoward Apartment; he ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, at beſt, like a Man out of his Wits, with a Swaggering pair of Ears, but not one inch of Hair; whereby you ought to underſtand, my Beloved, that he is no Legal Nazarite in the firſt place, and has been ſo Fortunate as to keep his Lugs on his Logger-head, tho by the Law of the Land he deſerves to have them cropt (if not cut off) as well as the <hi>Triumviri</hi> of their Order, Profeſſors of the Three moſt Noble Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the Nation, Divinity, Law, and Phyſick. He is <hi>Mercurius Coeleſtis,</hi> the Divine Mercury, or <hi>Prime Gazeteer,</hi> who acquaints the Lord of Hoſts with the Succeſs of Battles fought by his Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar People (as he Cants it in his Religious <hi>Jargon</hi>) during the late Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled Rebellion; and was the only Trumpet that Rais'd and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented it. He Out-gapes a Tarpaulin in a Hurricane, which induceth me to believe that the Diſtance of the Heavens is more remote than Aſtronomers hy their Obſervations have Diſcovered, or otherwiſe his Affected and Squeaking Tone were enuf to reach the Bleſſed Spirits, and Diſturb them in their Heavenly <hi>Chorus</hi> of <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> He is the true Pulpit-Boffoon, the Eccleſiaſtical Mammamouchie, ſuch a Cuſheon-Cuffer, that it wants no Duſting for a Twelve-Month after. He can Prate and Pray (as he miſ-calls it) three hours com<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Sight of that Innocent and Decent Ornament, the Surplice will frighten him into a Tertian, and the Harmonious Sound of a well-tun'd Organ, touch'd by a Skilful Hand, caſt him into an Hectic Feaver; a Diſtemper that ſcorns the power of Drugs, and is only Cur'd by Death. He's one that pretends to Religion, but abhors all Decency and Order; a Slovenly Fellow in Divinity, a mere Cloak

or Demicaſter-Divine, that ſcorns, and indeed deſerves not, the Ornamental Veſture of Cap and Gown.

And what think you is the Reward of this Ejaculatory Vanity? Why, he is Supported for it by thoſe (that want Wit, God kno's, more than he does Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) I mean the Quarterly Benevolence of an Apron'd Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that Comfort the Cockles of his Heart with Cawdles and Reſtoratives, weekly at leaſt; beſides the Religious Vails that he receives at a Galloping-Lecture; and the Work of the Day being over, then he makes uſe of a Point of Chamber-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and beſtows on his Benefactreſſes a Holy Kiſs, and ſo Engenders Faith and Goodneſs in them, by his Cloſe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badineira,</hi> and the Spaniſh <hi>Mariana,</hi> are the two Politic Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els that he keeps in his Cloſet, who hath ſo imbib'd their King-Killing Tenets, that it is a matter of no ſmall Difficulty to Judge, whether the Jeſuit be Presbyteriz'd, or the Presbyter Jeſuited; there is ſuch a Metempſychoſis and Tranſamination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that it would puzzle <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himſelf to judge which is which; and if you ad the Directory, and Aſſemblies Annotations, you have a Complete Catalogue of his Library. Nay farther, He's a pretty Beagle that Howls forth Sedition, and Belcheth out Blaſphemy, <hi>A la volee,</hi> at Random; and if a well-minded Chriſtian be his Remembrancer, and Tax him with his Error, he then has Recourſe to his Zeal and Fervor, and affirms that his Holy Language is un-underſtood by the Prophane Reprover. Set-Forms of Prayer he calls the Stifling of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54350:4"/>
the Spirit, and meer Lip-labour, which are an Abomination to the Godly; but to Preach and Pray Extrumpery, and <hi>ad Saltum,</hi> O! there's the life and pulſe of Religion, in ſuch Fervent Oraiſons and Vigorous Ejaculations. If there be one Sentence of Senſe or Coherence in Two Hours Diſcourſe, he that hears him may venture to forfeit both his Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for his Folly in Laviſhing away his Time at ſo Idle a Rate. His Method is Singular, for he Quotes you a Scripture, and then as ſoon plays the Fugitive, runs away from his Text, and Prates ſo long, till his Auditory run away from him too, before he has done. He's ſuch a Cuſhion-<hi>Cuffer,</hi> that he beats the <hi>Suggeſtum,</hi> till the Place Eccho's with the Noiſe of his Hand-Cuffs; and it is impoſſible for a Man over-grown with a Deep Lethargy, to take a Nap in his Conventicle; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can do that, he will catch you (as <hi>Moſs</hi> caught his Mare) Napping. The Common Prayer is his Common Grief, tho' ſome of the Common People Curſe him for it; but he, like a Religious Fox, verifies the Proverb, <hi>The more he's Curs'd the more he Thrives.</hi> He's a Turbulent Fop, who is never Content with any Government, till his Head be Elevated a Pole higher than his Shoulders; and in truth, <hi>London-Bridge</hi> is the beſt place for a Presbyterian Noddle. He ſtudies Invectives againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> and in plain Engliſh, upon the account of his Eccleſiaſtical Authority, is himſelf but a Parochial Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and Damns and Saves <hi>ad Libitum,</hi> as he pleaſes; like his Holineſs, who preſumes to do ſo too. He walks as Demurely as a Spaniard, or like a Man newly Recover'd of a Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that you may ſay the Dominical Prayer between every ſtep. He's a Man of a Crazy Conſtitution at beſt, and when he Salutes you, he pulls off his Caſtor with more unbecoming For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality and Simple Affectation, than a Countrey Carrier. He's of a Stubborn Inflexible Perſwaſion, one that will Bow to a Kirk-Jockey, but not the Lord Jeſus: he will Cringe to a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Siſter, but can't bend the Ham in the Lords Prayer. Yea, and Nay, is the Standard of his Converſation, and I ſolemnly Proteſt and Vow, the higheſt of his Aſſeverations. In truth his Religion is but a meer Puppet-ſhow, for he delights only in Formality, tho' he hates all Approved Forms of well Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Devotion. Look upon him in <hi>Puris Naturalibus,</hi> and Nature has Imprinted a Lively Character of him; for he is but an Inch on this ſide of a Natural. His True Zeal he pretends to (if any) is too Hot, and his falſe Religion (as we juſtly term it) is too Cold. In ſhort, He's a Church Incendiary, a Pulpit Boutefeu, an Eccleſiaſtic Buffoon, a Preacher of Sedition,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54350:4"/>
a Fomenter of Rebellion, a pretended Friend both to King and Countrey; but in truth the ſole Enemy of both. And ſo we leave him and his Faction to a Condign Puniſhment here, and conclude with a ſlight, tho' home Touch, of their State here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by an account of a late Viſion in Hell. That there are no <hi>Presbyters</hi> in Hell, that's the Tenet which was prov'd Irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably, by the Great Learning and Sophiſtry of a Reverend El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (I mean <hi>Presbyter,</hi> for that's his Down-right Engliſh Name) who did hold forth in that Large and and Spacious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation at <hi>Pinners Hall,</hi> and in his Sermon did ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate on the Commendations and Merits of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> returnng great Acknowledgement to the Diſpoſer of all Things, that his Lot was caſt to be one of that Society, and happily Clos'd his Ingenious Harangue with this his late Viſion: Not long ago, when the Sun had deſerted our Hemiſphere, and all things were at their Reſt, but the Active Fancy of Man, I was ſuddenly ſurpriz'd with a Strange, but True Dream, that I was by an unheard of Providence, carried into Hell; where arriv'd, I to ſatisfie my Curioſity, Gaz'd about, and there I ſaw, as my Imagination prompted me to believe, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Popes, Emperors, Potentates, Kings, Queens, Cardinals, Jeſuits, Independents, Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, Quakers, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenarians, with a vaſt number of Monks and Friers; nay, ſome of all Profeſſions whatſoever, whether Civil or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical: But upon the ſtricteſt Survey I cou'd make, not one Presbyter appear'd among them all: So that with Erected Hands I Darted up a Pious Ejaculation to Heaven, that it was my Chance, by the Aſſiſtance of Providence, to be of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Order, of whom many were Deceaſed, but none for their Impieties ſent to Hell; and ſo he concluded his Harangue with a freſh Panegyric of the Presbyterian party.</p>
            <p>The Sunday ſubſequent, it was the fortune likewiſe of an Independent to Teach in the ſame Congregation, where he made a large Repetition of the major part of the Presbyterians Work, the precedent Day, and did bemoan himſelf that he was not ſo Happy to be of that Fraternity; but <hi>in fine,</hi> he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Aſſembly as followeth; I, ſaid he, alſo had a Viſion, wherein I imagin'd my ſelf in Hell, and eſpied ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons of all Orders, eſpecially of the Independents, which made me with Aſtoniſhment Exclaim, <hi>O what a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Order is this! O that I had been a Presbyter! O that I had never underſtood Independency!</hi> But recollecting my ſelf, as my phancy prompted me, I Beckon'd to a Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fiend in that Infernal Region, whiſper'd to him, and

asked him, Whether there were no <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in thoſe Territories? Who Replied very Affably and Civilly, That there were none, but that they were Lock'd up in a large <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignation</hi> below the place where I was, and there they were in Multitudes, and Throng'd ſo faſt to thoſe Subterraneous Regions, that there was ſcarce room enuf to contain them: but they were too Seditious to be in the Common Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Damn'd, for if they were, they would ſet <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s whole Kingdom on Flame, and put all his Inhabitants and Vaſſals into an Univerſal and Domiſtic Rebellion. Nay farther, that he durſt not let them have a <hi>Mariana</hi> or <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> for fear they ſhou'd Preach Sedition, and be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and ſo conſequently ſet his whole Dominions into a Combuſtion.</p>
            <p>To cloſe all with the words of a Learned Pen, There was never ſuch a Monſter as the Quondam Ruling, and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Presbytery: The Father of it Rebellion, the Mother Inſurrection, the Midwife Sacrilege, the Nurſe Covetouſneſs, the Milk Schiſm, the Coats Armor, the Rattle Drums, a Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sword the Coral, and Money the Babies it delights to play withal: It gro's up to be a Stripling, and goes to School to a Council of War, its Leſſon is on the Trumpet, it's Feſcu a Piſtol, it's going out of School is in Rank and File, it's Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days the Days of Battle, and black Monday the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It com's of Age, and is Married with a Solemn League and Covenant, it begets Children like it ſelf, whoſe Bleſſing upon them is the power of the Sword, and whoſe Impoſition of hands are broken Pates. This Monſter pulls down the truly Ancient, Apoſtolic Power, which the Biſhops exerciſed, and delivers up their King to the Hang-Man. And thus farewel, thou Notorious Impoſtor, known by the Common Name of <hi>Jack Presbyter.</hi>
