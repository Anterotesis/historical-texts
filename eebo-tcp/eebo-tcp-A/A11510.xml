            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

yet they which designe quiet possession of their owne,

The reasons why the <hi>Romans</hi> preuailed vpon <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
               <note place="margin">Polib.</note>
being alike instituted, are another consideration,
the manner of building, the constancy, vertue, and
goodnesse of Instruments are great differences. In
these the <hi>Romans</hi> excelled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perhaps in the
youth (for euery <hi>State</hi> hath an Infancy, a mature, and
a decrepitage) and consequently soonest arriued at
their ends. But that wherein most effectually they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed,
was in Counsels; in which they had aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in the forme of their gouernment: For the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>Carthage,</hi> in all deliberations, had too much au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
which bred delay, and hindered secrecy;
whereas in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Optimati,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and wise men, onely resolued. <hi>Imus ad bellum,

cunctis praesentibus tractari, ratio rerum, aut occasionum
velocitas patitur. Victoria consilijs, &amp; ratione perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From these Considerations a Consequence is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
that when any two great Kingdomes fall into
a warre, that which will preuaile, must consider the
ends of the other, and the wayes and meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are prosecuted, and to them must apply all
industry, and direct opposition. In the ends, as there
is great difference, so there is great aduantage by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
because actiue things, <hi>etiamsi agendo repatiantur,</hi>
weare-out passiue, though of equall strength and
hardnesse, as the iron that strikes, in time batters that
which suffers. <hi>Common-wealths</hi> that designe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and are alway attentiue to watch occasion,
get ground vpon the modest, more by vigilancy then
force: and fraud, which is a terrible instrument, doth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17293:4"/>
euer accompany Ambition. Counsels vanquish
Armes, as spirituall things are predominant vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall,
and as fire dissolues the fastest metals: &amp; those
Counsels are most preualent, which are vnited in one
head, and issue from one fountaine.</p>
            <p>Therefore rising and encreasing Empires are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
if they once grow great, and must be resisted
in their ends, and in their counsels: single defence is
not sufficient: troublesome neighbours must be made
passiue, to abate their reputation, which the spirit of
action presupposeth.</p>
            <p>To apply these premisses, hauing read with pleasure
the following Discourse of the Reasons of the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

it would be a good recreation, and not vnacceptable
to my loyall Countrimen, to teach it to speake as
plaine <hi>English,</hi> as it doth truth; and finding the whole
scope of the Author (an Authour of great worth, and
greater works) to be an information to the World,
of the dangerous encrease, and ambition of the house

pretending occasion to send another of his Tribe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Iehuda Serfati,</hi> vpon priuate affaires (but practised
by the Ministers of <hi>Spaine</hi>) into that Country; as soon
as he arriued at the frontire, by the Kings order he was
created an Ambassador from the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and
conducted in that qualitie to the Court, and a Counsel
held, in what manner to giue him audience; His name
was already changed to <hi>Don Gabriell di Bona-Ventura,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:17293:7"/>
his Instructions drawne by a <hi>Iunto</hi> for the purpose; and
thus hee was shewed abroad, defrayed by the King,
and his Message published, that hee was imployed to
offer Peace and friendship from the <hi>Turkish Emperour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this Scene was acted, he was sent backe with
true Letters of <hi>Don Christofero di Mora,</hi> and the <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Catagna,</hi> to the great <hi>Vizier,</hi> and for his better

signed by the King <hi>Yoel Rey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Passing by <hi>Sicily,</hi> by Catholique Order, Forty Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
Slaues were deliuered him, to present at the Port,
in earnest of the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Ottoman</hi> amitie; Letters

him to spend, &amp; procure answer from the <hi>Grand

the great Officers.</p>
            <p>With which Orders and Armes being arriued at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> he vsed all meanes, with all men, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an acceptance of the Peace, vrging and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
the earnest affection, and desire of the King of
<hi>Spaine</hi> to conclude it.</p>
            <p>But this practise being discouered by the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
resident at the Port, and others not too well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to <hi>Spaine,</hi> the falshood was made appeare: and
<hi>Don Gabriel</hi> by the great <hi>Vizier</hi> was clapt in prison, as
a Counterfeit and Impostor.</p>
            <p>In a few moneths this <hi>Vizier</hi> was displaced, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
aduanced to his Office, and, as it is a common
rule with them, to runne a contrary course to their
fallen Predecessors, without examining the merits or
causes: this <hi>Iew</hi> was set at libertie, and all his actions
and Letters approued, as true and authenticall; And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17293:7"/>
thereupon Petition made to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the Negotiation; and by the counsell of the
new Ministers, it was admitted, and accepted, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
granted to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that seeing hee had
shewed so much affection to peace, and to enter into
a sincere Correspondence with the Port, especially by
the charitable liberty of so many <hi>Mahometans</hi> freely
presented; that the Gates of the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> were
alway open to whomsoeuer did seeke their friendship:
and that Ambassadors might securely come to treat

            <p>With these Letters to the <hi>Catholique King,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to <hi>Don Christofero di Mora,</hi> and the <hi>Secretary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagna</hi>

his iourney through <hi>Germany.</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Rodolphus</hi> being then in warre with <hi>Sultan Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemet,</hi>
he was stayed, and examined on the Borders;
To free himselfe, he fained that he had Letters to the
<hi>Emperour;</hi> whereupon all his papers were seized, and
sent to <hi>Prague.</hi> His <hi>Imperiall Maiesty</hi> very discontent,
and iealous of such Treaties betweene <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,</hi>
without his communication, and in such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncture;
gaue order, that the <hi>Iew</hi> should be brought
to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and kept in close Prison, vntill he had some
advice from <hi>Madrid.</hi> The <hi>Catholique</hi> King, finding
<hi>diu non latêre scelera,</hi> to saue the honor of his priuate
Designes, denyed the fact, forsooke and protested the
poore <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> who miserably there ended his
life, <hi>conassai mala-ventura.</hi> It may be collected, that
the Spanish ends of this Treaty were such as durst not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17293:8"/>
abide the light, seeing they might not bee trusted to
the nearest friend; and it was iudged great modesty,
to be ashamed, and the part of a good <hi>Christian,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
secret practises with <hi>Turkes,</hi> by the mediation
of <hi>Iewes,</hi> but of an ill Master, to leaue and abandon his
Seruant. Such Vessels in the hands of Princes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for honor, or dishonor, as their interests counsell
them.</p>
            <p>In later times, the extraordinary Ambassadors of
the <hi>Emperour,</hi> treating at <hi>Constantinople</hi> the frontire
Affaires, and accidentall Breaches, another ouerture
was by them made in the name of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
and the best argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sed was, that the world knew
but two great and <hi>Imperiall</hi> Families, <hi>Austria,</hi> and <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman,</hi>
who if they were reconciled, might make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diuision of <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West:</hi> The rest, it is more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
to conceale, then Christianitie to negotiate.</p>
            <p>This last yeare a <hi>Bolognese</hi> was sent from the Vice-King
of <hi>Naples,</hi> in pursuit of the same Designe; and
counterfeit Letters printed in <hi>Spaine,</hi> with a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of impossible presents, pretended from the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to beg peace, and spread abroad, to add
reputation to his Armies; as if the world would trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at a smoake: And though this Engine returned
fruitlesse, yet <hi>Spaine</hi> is not hopelesse. They know the
ease and aduantage they should draw, by securitie on
this side, to haue all their Gallies at libertie, to shut vp
the <hi>Straights,</hi> to hinder traffique, and to succour <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua;</hi>
and their Garrisons of <hi>Calabria</hi> and <hi>Sicily free,</hi>
to be imployed in their other necessities. And here it
cannot be ouer-passed, that while <hi>Spaine</hi> did negotiate
this Peace, doubting not to effect it, the same instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17293:8"/>
were imployed with monies and Letters, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the <hi>Cossacques</hi> (though in preiudice of the Peace
of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> allyed to the House of <hi>Austria</hi>
by a double mariage) to inuade the <hi>Bospherus,</hi> that the
Armado of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> might necessarily be
kept in the blacke-Sea, for defence, whereby the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> by a fine Art, doth enioy halfe the fruits of
the Peace, without obtaining it: These are a modell
of the wayes and counsels of the <hi>Spanish Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>

<hi>Poland</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> vnder the colour
of a peace, without care of the vtilitie of that Crowne
so neerly to him allyed: It may be concluded, that
<hi>ambition of vniuersall Monarchy, is onely able to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish

of <hi>England,</hi> as the Designes of the Enemy, from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
some lessons are best taught, and their Counsells to
their owne ends doe clearly demonstrate, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of diuers <hi>Iunto's</hi> haue laid for a foundation: It

timely to preuent it: and not be bound to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage
of making a desperate Bett, when the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
shall call, and the game irrecouerable.</p>
            <p>These Demonstrations admitted for true, the next
Consideration will be, by what meanes most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and virtually to worke a iust defence; Wherein if
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17293:9"/>
the Ends, Counsells, and Wayes, whereby <hi>Spaine</hi>
hath in few yeares aduanced, bee obserued, they will
reflect a true light vpon the contrary, how they may
be humbled.</p>
            <p>The end of <hi>Spaine</hi> is <hi>Vniuersall Monarchy,</hi> confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the <hi>Romans</hi> in all; but the noble contempt
of <hi>Treasons:</hi> Herein, and in Counsells, they haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of vs. It must then be concluded to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this end, wee must resolue the like, and pursue it
with the like wayes, and Counsells, (except onely the
wayes of <hi>Darkenesse</hi>) to take from them those ranke
parts, which nourish this Concupiscence.</p>
            <p>To discouer the right line of this opposition, it
may be enquired, what <hi>Spaine</hi> did aduance in the last
warre, in the blessed dayes of the <hi>glorious Queene
Elizabeth,</hi> either vpon <hi>England, France, Germany, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi>
or <hi>Holland,</hi> and the totall summe shall be found
nothing. Whether they lost in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or of their
owne, is not the question, for the warre was in the
end defensiue, and hee is beaten, that assailing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
not; But that the <hi>Indies</hi> were not able to supply,
nor appease the mutinies of his Souldiers, nor to pay
the Interests of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and that they had lost all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and sought peace on all sides <hi>precariò,
Hoochstrat,</hi> the <hi>Electo's,</hi> their <hi>Bills protested, their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailng
Fryars, their owne Ambassages</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi>
are irrefutable witnesses.</p>
            <p>To account what they haue gotten in these latter
yeares of <hi>Peace,</hi> onely by <hi>peace,</hi> besides the daring so
bold an Act, as to expell many Millions of inborne
Enemies, and thereby raising another <hi>Indea</hi> of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

out of <hi>Italy,</hi> this fate of <hi>Carthage</hi> vndertooke
to transport the warre to their own doores; and then,
hee that neuer refused to fight, treated, sought peace,
and almost confessed that he was vanquished; then he
made that pittifull oration, the most inglorious of all
his Acts:<note place="margin">Hanib. ad Scip.</note>

<hi>Haniball</hi> knew hee might safelier haue lost all

<hi>Italy,</hi> to wast <hi>Rome</hi> at their owne charges. But <hi>Scipio</hi>

of ambition ariseth: and as in naturall Bodies,
there are other parts, besides the head and the heart,
which being cut off, or wounded, cause desolution, so
it is possible to find a way to weaken that Monster,
which cannot bee killed at one blow.</p>
            <p>Great preparations at mighty expences giue too

The contrary then, which is a firme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

diuide <hi>indivisibile</hi> is lost labour, the Designes of <hi>Spaine</hi>
are one, vnited in the head, <hi>in genere generalissimo,</hi> the
House of <hi>Austria,</hi> which cannot be distracted. They
haue no other maine and important adherent, but the
Pope, and his Ecclesiasticall Dependents, and these
also make but one, and meet in the Center, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17293:12"/>
in common and mingled ends. And they greatly
erre, who suppose, that it is euer possible to finde a
Pope vnpartiall for <hi>Spaine,</hi> or to fauour any other
Prince against them. Let <hi>Vrban</hi> the Eighth serue for
an example, rais'd and fed by <hi>France,</hi> yet fallen to
their enemies, <hi>per ragione di stato.</hi> One fresh and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
instance will discouer both this vnitie, and the
aduantage of Spanish Counsells. When the Treaty
of <hi>Madrid</hi> for the liberty of the <hi>Valteline</hi> was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and roundly pressed by the <hi>French,</hi> some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
remaining, to prolong the possession, the Forts
of that Vally were, by consent, deliuered to the Pope,
<hi>tanquam communi Patri in Deposito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This seemed very equall, but the <hi>French</hi> were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-reached;
For they hoped vpon the iustice of their
Cause, and that a sentence would timely be giuen for
them, which was impossible: For the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was
content, that the Deposition should remaine for euer
to his vse; and he knew that the Pope, by accepting
it, was engag'd neuer to surrender to the <hi>Grisons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>spirituall</hi> Father could neuer deliuer his
Children (behold another title) to the subiection and
will of Heretiques: and if the <hi>French</hi> should at last
vse force, his <hi>Holinesse</hi> was doubly intangled, both in
honor and conscience, to vnite with <hi>Spaine,</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his Depositation. This the <hi>French</hi> did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see,
and fel vpon a disaduantage to recouer it from the
Pope, a matter of dangerous consequence. Who, at
last, takes Armes in the Cause, as the World knowes.
But when both the Pope and <hi>Spaine</hi> saw such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
storme, and Colleguation, and foresaw, that there
was no remedie but to lose it by Armes, which being
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17293:12"/>
victorious, might quarrell with <hi>Millan,</hi> or finde new
obiects of their disdaine, they resolued rather to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
it, and to seeme to yeeld to Iustice. But who
must doe it? The Pope by no meanes can consent to
deliuer part of his flocke to wolues, so his Ambassage
protested in <hi>France,</hi> therefore, by secret conniuence
and agreement, the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> doth suddenly seale
the old Articles, and makes the Transaction before
<hi>Barbarini</hi> shall arriue, to saue the Popes honor: For
a temporall Prince may <hi>saluâ conscientiâ</hi> restore <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques</hi>
to their temporall rights, which the Pope, a
higher pretender, ouer soule, body and goods, cannot
doe. By this cunning they hope to separate the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
vnited, the quarrell being, in outward appearance,
ended; and by this Intelligence it is euident, that the
<hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>temporall</hi> serue one another, and take
turnes, and shift Interests, for mutuall aduantage. But
if examples proue not <hi>categorically</hi> let it be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the <hi>spirituall</hi> and <hi>temporall Monarchies,</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> haue such mutuall interest
and affinitie, and are so woven one within the other,
that though natural affection, or other respects of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
may for a time retard, &amp; perhaps striue against
an open declaration, yet when necessitie exacteth a
resolution, the essence and mystery of the <hi>Papacie</hi> will
preuaile: It must forsake father and mother, and
cleaue to this double supremacie; for <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi>
must stand and fall together.</p>
            <p>To proceed, when the <hi>Romans</hi> first transported
their Legions into <hi>Greece,</hi> they were called in by diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to restore that shew of liberty to a part, which
they absolutely tooke from all <hi>Greece.</hi> Separation and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17293:13"/>
disunion by them fomented, opened a Port to a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
which vnited, was like their <hi>Phalanx,</hi> not to
be broken. And certainly this day, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue
more hope to diuide the Princes colleagued, then to
vanquish them: To which vse, they haue two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Instruments, <hi>Money</hi> for the <hi>Traitor,</hi> and a <hi>Pope</hi>
for the <hi>Conscience.</hi> It is obserued, that <hi>Spaine</hi> will buy

by the Confederate warre <hi>du bien public,</hi> wherein
his brother, the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Caralois,</hi> and the Duke of

supplied the King with a good Counsell,<note place="margin">Comines.</note> to agree to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conditions, with any of the League, to disband, or
to sowe a iealousie among them; preseruing onely his
Armes entire, with which, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were separated,
he might humble them singly, at his pleasure; adding,
that Princes lost no reputation, when they attained
their ends. The History is vulgar, and the successe of
that aduice, was, the flight of the Duke of <hi>Berry,</hi> the
staine of <hi>Charles of Burgundy,</hi> and the beggery of
<hi>Bretagny.</hi> I am perswaded, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
the Doctrine, and would come to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with any of the Leagues, to disunite them: and
the Breach once made is not easily repaired. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in this Coniuncture, they would (if honour
would suffer it) consent to make a generall <hi>peace,</hi>
vntill Armes were deposed; But here is the present
danger, to loose an opportunity, not to bee recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

know at how great expence of time, and charge of
Ambassages, these Leagues haue beene composing;
which once dissolued, and lulled asleepe in security,
would slowly returne to the present perfection.

giuen expresse Command to the <hi>President de Silerye</hi>
to consent to no Conuention, so long as one foote of

especially the Title of <hi>Soueraignty</hi> inuiting, and
iustifying that progresse, he consulted first, his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi>
of <hi>State,</hi> for the restitution, who, loath to remit
any thing of their stiffnesse, interposed the respects of
honour, and so it was necessary, not to confesse ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to keepe them; but the wise King, knowing, to
contend might draw the quarrell into the bowells of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> resoluing both to preuent the occasion, and
to saue his reputation, called his <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi>
to deliuer their opinion, who concluded, that hee
could not by the Lawes of Religion vsurpe, nor dye
with quietnesse of soule, if he restored not to euery
man his owne: and so those places were piously sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered,
which could not safely be maintained; But

the tender Conscience of a Father, whether
hee might with safety of Conscience pardon his

and pleaded their Contracts in the name, and
by vertue of the Kings order: Who remitted them,

approbation of this Court of Conscience; Nothing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17293:15"/>
so vnsure, as what Law, or equitie is the rule thereof.
Therfore, that Peace onely will be secure with <hi>Spaine,</hi>
which the two Counsells of State, and Conscience

            <p>To reduce this Discourse to a briefe Conclusion,
If right iudgement of all <hi>States</hi> arise from their ends;
If their Counsells direct the way to discouer them,
and both being discerned to affect Conquest, must
be actiuely opposed, lest they preuaile vpon a suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
modestie; If the ends of <hi>Spaine</hi> are apparently
<hi>Vniversall Monarchy,</hi> and all their Counsells, by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations,
infamous, and vnchristian, or by practises
of fomenting Treasons, and diuisions among their
neighbours, are directed to attaine that end; If the
Pope must be alway obsequious for the affinity of
their common ends; If there be no securitie of
Peace, but in their pouerty: What other resolution
can bee proposed, then that a liuely warre must bee
transported to that part of the Dominions of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
which being separated and cut off, the ancient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
and naturall constitution of that Kingdome
may returne, to bee glad to liue in Peace, and eate
quietly their owne Figs and Oliues. And because in
great diseases, as well blood and ill humours must
be diuerted, as the main Cure intended; so it wil be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
more for expedition then necessitie of health,
to imitate other States in thrift. <hi>France</hi> in times past,
had <hi>Scotland, England, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Navarre;
Spaine</hi> their owne <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Barbary,</hi> euery king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

            <p>There remaines onely of my purpose, to preuent a
Question; why I haue chosen to dedicate, by this
Epistle, the ensuing Translation, to you most worthy
Senators of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons.</hi> For this boldnes
may be subiect to various misinterpretations. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
will suspect me of so great arrogance, as that I hope
to teach you any thing you doe not know. But seeing
your owne wisedome did first foresee the necessity
of a warre with <hi>Spaine,</hi> and your owne zeale to the
honour of your King, did counsell to vndertake it, I
thought such forraine Meditations as these, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with your owne thoughts, might also animate
and nourish in you a spirit, and generous Resolution,
vigorously to maintaine it. You know how much of
the good successe of great Actions depends vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and they haue aduanced much, who haue
gotten opinion. As <hi>Astrologers</hi> make their iudgments
vpon the first minute of time in Natiuities, so doth
the world prognosticate of the happy successes of
Princes, by the first coniunctures in their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and their first actions abroad: Therefore <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standum

               <hi>Neque
arma sine stipendijs, neque stipendia sine tributis, haberi
queunt.</hi> If you now restraine your liberall hand, you
expose your Prince to dishonor, and your Country to
Consumption. It is Time onely that will macerate
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17293:16"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> when without traffique and exchange, and

exported to pay forraine Armies. <hi>Qui citò dat, bis dat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seneca.</note>
and it is ill husbandry to doe that sparingly, which
cannot be well done but at once and speedily. It will
be time to be thrifty in the members and particulars,
when the Head and the whole <hi>State</hi> is safe. And if
you deferre vntill a lingring warre hath exhausted
you, Remember that which remaines will not suffice,

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He miseries of the vnhappy <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi>
are now at last so notorious; so
intollerable are the barbarous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
and tyrannies, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
thereof doe suffer, as slaues
vnder the <hi>Grisons,</hi> their pretended
Lords and Superiours; that they
ought certainly to stirre vp great
compassion in the mindes, and for
their reliefe also, the force of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and people farre remoued; And seeing this, contrary to
all expectation and equitie, is not to them administred; now,
that of themselues, with the meanes giuen them almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the hand of God, they haue procured to free
them from so sharp a bondage, they might beleeue, that for
their iustification in that action before the World, there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no other diligence: Neuerthelesse, seeing the malice of
peruerse Ministers, the tongues and infernall pennes (with
which Tyrants serue their owne occasions) haue too great
credit with the vulgar, to obscure any truth, how cleare so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
to calumniate Innocency, and to procure hatred, it
hath beene thought fit, to publish this Treatise, by which all
men may be informed briefly, and truly, that what they haue
done, is not onely right, by all <hi>Diuine</hi> and <hi>Humane law,</hi> but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17293:18"/>
worthy to be approued with high praises, of men iudicious,
intelligent, and well affected to <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Christianity;</hi> and
to be protected by all States and Princes.</p>
            <p>Omitting therefore colours, and artifice of words, proper
to those ministers, who study nothing, but to deceiue: Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one doth know, that all which a Subiect can pretend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in <hi>Soule, Life, Honor,</hi> and <hi>Goods;</hi> Of all these, nothing
remained to the miserable <hi>Valtoliues,</hi> wherein they were not
extreamly oppressed, and tyrannized.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Soule,</hi> it is sufficiently knowne, that the
Inhabitants of that Vally were anciently bred, and nourished
in the <hi>holy Roman Catholique faith;</hi> That therein, are many
beautifull Churches, dedicated to the blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Saints,</hi> fauoured by God with graces and miracles, and
therefore frequented by the deuout concourse of sundry Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to the great comfort and benefit of the People, who
were by the <hi>Catholiques</hi> to them admitted, in them to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
<hi>Masse,</hi> and <hi>Seruices,</hi> for the health of their soules, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the holy <hi>Roman Rite.</hi> But now these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> giuen
vp in prey, to the most peruerse Professors of euery Heresie,
and particularly of <hi>Caluinisme,</hi> haue so with all their industry
wrought, that this poyson hath slided, and infected the
whole Valley; from whence it may more easily spread
into the bordering parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> And although first
they did not apparently shew to take from the People, the
vse of their ancient religion, yet their actions manifestly were
thereunto addressed; seeing by their Decrees, they gaue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to the Heretiques, to prophane the old <hi>Catholique Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
with their Preachings, and Burialls; and doe take away
the reuenues left to <hi>Catholique Churches</hi> for Masses, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
offices, which they transferre to <hi>hereticall</hi> Ministers; That
they inforce Catholiques to built them Churches; That
they extinguish wholly Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction, depriuing
the <hi>Catholiques</hi> of the publication of Indulgence, and Iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees,
and of Entrance into Orders, taking away all their
Goods; and from the Pastorall Cure of their Bishop, Not
suffering any to obey him, nor that he should come to visit or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17293:18"/>
comfort them; That they permit the Heretique Ministers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
to treade downe the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Catholique</hi>
Church, and if any oppose, hee is suddainly, and barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punished in life and goods; That they exclude out of the
<hi>Vally,</hi> almost all the <hi>orders</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> admitting on the other
part, indistinctly, hereticall Ministers, of all Nations; That
they erect <hi>Seminaries</hi> and lately hereticall Colledges, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
them the profits, tithes, Canonryes, and Benefits
taken from the Curates and <hi>Catholique</hi> Church. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> all these,
there are passed <hi>Decrees, Statutes,</hi> and open <hi>Edicts;</hi> And of
Cases particular, there are publique Acts whereof the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is too fresh, and renewed by most cruell death inflicted on
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> men, in the most Infamous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
imaginable. Now what else is this, but to vse manifest
Tyrannie ouer the soules of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Subiects, to take
from them those helpes wherewith they aduance their <hi>salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and their way to <hi>Heauen,</hi> and to enforce them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
a new Religion which leads them downe to <hi>Hell?</hi> The

               </gap>est, and to shew it more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable.</p>
            <p>In the rest, to demonstrate the wretched estate of the said
Vally, it shall suffice, simply to represent the maner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
vsed many yeares past; it shall be sufficient to say,
that it hath beene giuen onely to him that would offer most
money, without any the least Consideration of abili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts necessary to such a charge; and that the <hi>Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
sent in apparance to remedy the forepast iniustice, were
of the same quality, and sometimes worse; Insomuch that
both the one, and the other had for their aynie, and thereto
onely did attend, to get their charges, and to heape vp, by
all imaginable meanes, so much Gold that therewith they
might returne to their owne houses enrich't for euer.</p>
            <p>From hence it proceeded, that the liues of poore Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
were a thousand waies ensnared, and often taken away
with open iniustice, at the instance of their Enemyes, who
with great summes of money bought them, and sometimes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17293:19"/>
after sharpe Imprisonment, and other torments, hardly were
dismissed naked, by the price of all their substance, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
openly to the Officers without any shame, in so much
security, that the miserable oppressed, both in life, and
goods, durst not thereof lament.</p>
            <p>By the same meanes, the estate of the Subiect in Ciuill
Causes was alwaies in great danger: For the Magistrates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
publiquely mercenary, it often happened that some did
loose by an vniust sentence dearely bought of the Aduersary;
and others, to preserue them against Iniustice, were forced
to present a great part to the Iudge.</p>
            <p>No Sentence although confirmed &amp; passed in Iudgement,
whether Ciuill or Criminall, was euer secure; because the
<hi>Successor,</hi> to dig out money, did renew the trouble to the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
acquitted, and for a new price did often racall without
any respect, that which of others, though iustly, had beene
iudged.</p>
            <p>Safe-Conducts were broken at their pleasure, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
faith with vaine pretences violated, to depriue life,
that by such death, they might enrich themselues. Lawes
and Statutes were not now with arts, and Stratagems
deluded, but openly despised, and trodden vnder foot, as if
all had beene freely giuen to them in prey.</p>
            <p>Orphans and Widdows, and others of that Condition,
so much recommended, both by diuine and humane law to
the protection of Princes, and Magistrates, as vnable to
helpe themselues, by infamous meanes; did remaine whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exposed to the auarice of rauening wolues, to the extreame
griefe and compassion of good men. On the other part, it
often occurred, that those wicked men, which had offended
others, in life, goods, and honor, being fallen into the hands
of Iustice, in stead of exemplary punishment, were for great
bribes, sometimes by vniust Iudgement absolued, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
vnder couler of feined escape, let free out of prison to
the great oppression and affliction of those, whom they
had wronged.</p>
            <p>There were seene numbers of infamous persons, gracious
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17293:19"/>
with the officers of Iustice, and by them rewarded, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they serued as Instruments, many and many wayes, to
betray the life and goods particularly of Catholiques; From
whence did often follow the destruction and ruine, now of
one, now of another family, alwayes of the most ancient, and
honorable of the Valley.</p>
            <p>Lastly, who shall well consider that which the <hi>Sicilians</hi> did
for three yeares suffer in the <hi>Roman</hi> Common wealth, vnder
the gouernment of the infamous <hi>Verres,</hi> shall find that the
vnhappy <hi>Valtelines</hi> haue endured much more, a longer time
from the hands of so many, worse then <hi>Verres;</hi> and perhapps
shall not find, any other gouernment so infamous, and which
so well resembles that, as this of the <hi>Grisons</hi> in the Vally,
which should more clearely be manifested, if it were here ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to represent all the Cases, and their circumstances
one by one, as it was for <hi>Cicero,</hi> handling his Cause for ends
far different from ours.</p>
            <p>That which makes our Case more full of compassio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is, that
when the miserable oppressed, haue attempted the refuge of
their <hi>Superiors</hi> for remedy against so many Tyrannies, and
Acts of Iniustice, the officers themselues, haue opposed with
<hi>seuerest</hi> banishments, and imprisonments, those, who for the
publike good intermedled, and when it hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
that all Impediments vanquished, the Procurators of
of the Vally haue arriued at the Community of the
<hi>Three Leagues,</hi> and haue informed particularly their many,
and excessiue grieuance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; in the end, after hauing receiued,
in diuers places, such affronts, that scarcely Slaues could
suffer, they haue rested deluded, without effect, or any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision.</p>
            <p>These things without doubt, are sufficient to take away
all hope, euer to find, vnder that gouernment, any ease of so
many miseries. But there are other accidents thereunto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
whereby the Subiects are brought into vtter desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The <hi>Assembly</hi> in the towne of <hi>Tosana,</hi> is already noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
which was applied to nothing else but the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of good, and <hi>Catholique men,</hi> as well <hi>Grisons,</hi> as <hi>Valtelines.</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:17293:20"/>
In the <hi>Diett</hi> there called, many banishments, and many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall
Condemnations were decreed: amongst which was
that against <hi>Nicolo Rusca</hi> Arch-Priest of <hi>Sondrio,</hi> a Priest of
most innocent life, and a true <hi>Martyr</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> tormented
and put to death, with all cruelty, and possible infamy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other fault, then being a good <hi>Catholique,</hi> &amp; a priest.
Now these Iniuries and Cruelties hauing necessitated some
<hi>Catholique</hi> Communities, to seeke redresse of so many euills,
vsing their vtmost force; they obtained that these <hi>Sentences</hi>
being reuiewed, were, as barbarous, and most vniust, reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
But a little time the remedy lasted, because those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
stirred vp by the fury of their Ministers, and which more
imported, moued by the practices and monies of that Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<hi>Potentate</hi> (who <hi>per ragion di stato</hi> makes any thing law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
how contrary soeuer to the honour of God, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his holy <hi>Catholique</hi> faith) returned to reassemble in
the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Tauos,</hi> where, in their new <hi>Diett,</hi> they haue not
onely reconfirmed all the euills of that of <hi>Tosana,</hi> but added
others, making <hi>Heads</hi> of the Persecution, &amp; Executioners of
their Arrests against <hi>Catholiques,</hi> the same hereticall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and by this occasion their tyrannicall gouernment is so
visibly established, (particularly by the Assistance and purse
of that <hi>Potentate,</hi> the principall Cause of so many euills to the
<hi>Christian Common Wealth</hi>) that the Subiects can expect no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but a declination to a worse Condition, and suddainely
to arriue at the height and extremity of all euills, now already
approaching.</p>
            <p>Admitting what hath bin already co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pendiously deliuered,
yet in such maner, that the Reader can neuer apprehend the
degree, whereto their tyrannicall gouernment was truely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
that seeing, as was in the beginning said, all diuine
and humane law did permit the <hi>Valtolines,</hi> to withdrawe
themselues by all possible meanes from so great a <hi>Tyranny,</hi> it
will appeare so cleare to euery one, that it will bee too much
vanity to heape vp reasons, proofes, and authorities, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in it selfe vndoubted, euen when it were discussed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
true Subiects, and Vassalls, and their naturall and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute

            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:17293:20"/>
But now by so much more shall it appeare lawfull, when
two things shall bee considered; the one, that the ancient <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations</hi>
of the Valley with the <hi>Grisons</hi> (following the end
hereof) doe show rather a confederation between them, then
a true subiection; and doe speake in such sort, that the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>
exercised by them in the Valley, is discouered to bee a
meere vsurpation; particularly, the <hi>Valtolines</hi> doe binde
themselues to the <hi>Grisons,</hi> with limitation to things lawful &amp;
honest; besides, the obligation is made ioyntly to the Bishop
of <hi>Coira,</hi> and the <hi>Three-leagues;</hi> where now, these <hi>Tyrants</hi>
hauing <hi>de facto</hi> excluded with <hi>Sacrilegious exulation,</hi> their
Bishop, haue alone vsurped that, which neither to them, nor
him, was granted. The other thing is, that whatsoeuer the
<hi>Valtolines</hi> yet haue done, hath beene prosecuted onely with
Intelligence and helpe of the sounder part of the <hi>Grisons</hi>
themselues, and not to rebell against their <hi>Lords</hi> (for such
certainly the <hi>Three-Leagus</hi> neuer were) but simply to reduce
themselues to the true State declared in their <hi>Capitulations,</hi>
so far forth as the mutations, alterations, and other Accidents

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Manifest printed in the name of
the <hi>Valteline,</hi> wherein the Reasons of
the Resolutions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lately by them taken
against the tyranny of the <hi>Grisons</hi> and
<hi>Heretiques,</hi> are alledged, hath giuen
great scandall to all wise men, who ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
doe comprehend from whence,
and why it was put to the <hi>Presse,</hi> the
<hi>Valtelines</hi> hauing no notice at all, much lesse any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Whereupon, hauing proposed, seriously to discourse, and
to bring to light, that truth, which others doe endeauor to
wrap vp in darknesse; I haue thought it an act of Iustice, and
of no little seruice to your <hi>Maiestie,</hi> whose minde truly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17293:22"/>
it may be feared, lest it become deceiued with a false
apparance of Pietie and Religion, with which the Deuill, a
perpetuall enemy of Princes well enclined, vseth oftentimes
to transforme himselfe into an Angell of light, and to offer
his help, as a guide, in the right path of Iustice and honestie,
to no other end, but to draw them without discouery, into
the crooked way of iniquitie and tyranny. But the better to
ground my Discourse, I will beginne somewhat high, and
imitate that good Architect, who purposing to build a strong
Tower, by how much he designeth to raise the top, so much
lower he layeth the foundation.</p>
            <p>That of <hi>Religion, (ô Sacred, Royall, Catholique Maiestie</hi>)
is certainly a very powerfull obiect, the which, though fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and disguised, euer raiseth a great commotion in the
mindes of them, who thereof make profession. For this cause
many Princes of the world, eyther by the counsell of ill mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
or through the greedinesse of their owne desires, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they embrace <hi>Prouinces, Kingdomes,</hi> and <hi>Empires,</hi> and
yet not satiated, when they want all other iust title to make
warre, and to seize by violence, that which they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
by Iustice, suddenly they take the pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi>
vnder which Cloake, they doe not onely seeke to couer their
vniust Actions, and to make them appeare lawfull and holy,
but therewith they inuite all men to fauour their attempts.
Many times also with an affection of holy zeale, with true
and vnfained Religion, with most iust and honest Titles, they
vndertake some Enterprises truly holy: But the Deuill, who
still practiseth to draw poyson from the fairest flowers, and
serueth himselfe with good, for an instrument of euill; in the
end reduceth that very Religion to proper interest; that
zeale of Pietie hee conuerteth to zeale of Ambition; and the
most iust Titles, hee vseth to the seruice of Tyrannicall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.
Therefore, where ordinarily the question of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
of <hi>States</hi> is handled, a iust Prince ought very well to
consider, if hee haue lawfull cause, and honest right to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
them; and where hee knowes no other Title, then that
of Religion, much more hee ought to be aduised, that it bee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17293:22"/>
not a faire and honest Couer, of a foule and wicked Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse.</p>

               <hi>Don Pedro</hi> the tenth King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and third of that

ancient enemies of our <hi>Christian Religion:</hi> For which holy
purpose he receiued great Aides of money from S. <hi>Lewis</hi> the

disguised in the habit of a Fryar, to stirre the mindes of
that Nation to rebell, who, for some ill vsage did shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
distasted with the <hi>French</hi> Gouernment. <hi>Iohn Procita</hi>
effected his businesse: The Rebellion of the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and
the destruction of the <hi>French</hi> followed. King <hi>Charles</hi> armed
for the recouery of his lost Kingdome, and the Rebells to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him: In the meane while <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> (that scarcely
hauing touched the Coast of <hi>Affrica,</hi> was retyred to <hi>Sardinia</hi>
to be nearer <hi>Sicily</hi>) obseruing the time, and occasion of his
designe fitting, suddenly went to <hi>Palermo,</hi> where hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
with great ioy and gladnesse, and published, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
King of the <hi>Siciltans,</hi> who flocked to him from all
parts of the Island. See now your <hi>Maiestie</hi> with what insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and cursed Art, vnder the colour of Religion, the King
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> faining to haue taken Armes against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of <hi>Christianity,</hi> tooke that Kingdome from a <hi>Christian
King,</hi> and <hi>foedary</hi> of <hi>Holy Church;</hi> and which is more, with
the help of that Gold, which he had receiued from the most
<hi>Christian</hi> King, right Brother of King <hi>Charles.</hi> Whereupon
the blessed Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fourth, a man of renowned
sanctitie (of whom, as the <hi>Spanish Pontificall,</hi> and other Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
doe report,<note place="margin">Igliescas vbi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> were seene many miracles after his death) did
excommunicate and depriue him of his Kingdomes, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
his Subiects of their Oath of Allegiance, giuing power
to any Prince to persecute him, as a common Enemy. Perhaps
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17293:23"/>
the holy Bishop thought that, with this rigour, the King <hi>Don
Pedro</hi> would be brought to acknowledge his error, and to
restore what he had ill gotten: But it proued without any
fruit; for hee which made it lawfull, vniustly to vsurpe the
rights of others, did little feare Ecclesiasticall censures for
their restitution.</p>
            <p>And what more <hi>Catholique,</hi> and more pious Enterprise
could bee imagined, then that of <hi>India,</hi> for the enlargement
or the <hi>sacred Gospell?</hi> What iuster title, then that which the
highest <hi>Bishop Alexander</hi> the Sixt did grant to the <hi>Catholique</hi>
Kings <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Isabell,</hi> in the new world; ordeyning
them as <hi>supreme Emperors,</hi> ouer those Kings and Infidell
Kingdomes? But after, what thing was more vniust, then
the Conquest of the immediat Dominion of those Countries?
I call it a Conquest, to enter with warre, to subdue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
before they were allured with the peacefull voice of
preaching and to take away the life of lawfull <hi>Lords,</hi> and
Naturall Princes, to vsurpe their <hi>States,</hi> notwithstanding
they did not hinder the <hi>promulgation</hi> of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were ready to receiue the holy <hi>Faith.</hi> And it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
truth, that when also they were not conuerted whilst
yet they did not oppose the progresse of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi>
they could not be, by the way of warre, subiected: that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to the will of <hi>Christ,</hi> who said, <hi>Speciosi pedes E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelizantium
pacem;</hi> And much lesse could they bee spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of their Dominion, seeing the same <hi>Christ,</hi> when he came
into the world, did declare, that the empire also of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
is iust, &amp; lawfull, commanding euen his own <hi>Apostles</hi> to
pay tribute to <hi>Caesar.</hi> Neither is it to bee beleeued, that the
<hi>Pope,</hi> when hee granted to the <hi>Catholique</hi> Kings, the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> had any thought to preiudice the
immediate Dominion of <hi>Gentile</hi> Princes, because he could
not doe it. The which the great <hi>Atabaliba,</hi> King of <hi>Peru</hi> did

            <p>That is:</p>
            <p>As if the Sonne of God, who dyed for euery one of them,
had commanded in his holy Law, when he said, <hi>Goe and teach
all Nations,</hi> that onely intimation should be made to peaceful
and quiet Infidels, which had their proper Lands; and if they
did not presently receiue the Faith, without other preaching,
or instruction, and should not submit themselues to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of that King, whom they neuer saw nor heard, whose
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17293:24"/>
messengers are so cruell, so impious, and so horrible Tyrants;
that they should lose, for this onely Cause, their goods, lands,
liberty, wiues, children, and life; which is a thing vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
absurd, &amp; worthy of all reproach, infamy, &amp; it Hell selfe.</p>
            <p>Thus, wisely speaking of the same matter, though vpon
another occasion, discourseth the Reuerend Bishop of <hi>Chiap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi>
a principall Citie of New <hi>Spaine</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> called Fryar
<hi>Bartholmy dalle Case,</hi> by Nation a <hi>Spanyard,</hi> by birth a <hi>Siuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
but zealous of Iustice, and a friend of truth, in his booke
of the destruction of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But returning to our Subiect; The King <hi>Atabaliba</hi> was
iustly scandalized, and grieuously moued, at this so learned
preaching, that answering to euery point, amongst other
things he said these words.</p>
            <p>Obedecer al Papa no me esta bien; porque deue de ser loco; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esdà

            </p>
            <p>To obey the <hi>Pope</hi> is not good for mee, because hee must
needs be a foole, seeing he giueth that to another, which is
none of his, and commands me to leaue that Kingdome,
which I haue inherited from my father, and would, I should
giue it to one, that I know not what he is.</p>
            <p>He could not certainly answer more wisely, according to
the Proposition; which was also false; Seeing the <hi>Pope</hi>
was not so void of Iudgement, to haue granted any such
conquest to the <hi>Catholique</hi> King, or any other, especially by
the way of warre, as the holy Preacher with threats, did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme;
being in it selfe, vniust and wicked: And therefore
the aforementioned, <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chiappa</hi> earnestly defending

Argument of affection, or of passion, cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in a Prelat of most exemplar life, who renounced his

it must be said, that onely the loue of truth did moue

his Assertions, doe most clearly demonstrate it. So that your

               </gap>, all the fore-alleadged discourses,
will in the sinceritie of your conscience, conclude that which
in the beginning was declared; That Enterprises vndertaken
onely for Religion, are often reduced to proper Interest, and
that Titles, Dignities, and Authorities, granted, with most
holy zeale, by the Vicar of Christ, haue beene peruersly
abused.</p>
            <p>It is very true, that this good Prelatate hath indeauoured
to excuse the <hi>Catholique</hi> Kings, by saying that the aboue
mentioned <hi>euills,</hi> were against their Intentions, clearely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in many orders, and holy instructions, giuen to those
crooked ministers, who obserued no part of them.</p>
            <p>But this excuse is not admitted of wise men, yea rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
with most strong Reasons.</p>
            <p>First, because it hath not beene found, that the Catholique
Kings did euer punish any of those Ministers (vnlesse perhaps
some for Rebellion) notwithstanding their wickednesse was
manifest vnto them, which the foresaid Bishop doth more
then once affirme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because so many iniquities by them committed
were neuer retracted; in particular, the Diuisions of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menda's,</hi>
vpon which the said Author doth exclaime, euen
to the Heauens.</p>
            <p>Lastly, because the immediate Dominions are encorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17293:26"/>
vniuersally and particularly with the Supreme Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and this is euident in fact, all faculty being taken from
them, which had it to choose their Prince; and the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
from them, to whom the estates by succession did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine;
of whom some miraculously escaping aliue, in that
destruction of the <hi>Indies,</hi> (lamentably by this Bishop descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed)
were transported into <hi>Spaine,</hi> lest by the loue of their
Naturall Subiects, they should aspire to recouer that, of
which against reason, they were depriued. And yet to this
day, the <hi>Issue</hi> of that great <hi>Motezuma Emperor</hi> of <hi>Mexico,</hi>
doe liue in the Court of your <hi>Maiestie,</hi> prohibited vpon
paine of life, to goe out of <hi>Castile.</hi> From which most true
reasons, the wisedome of your <hi>Maiestie</hi> may easily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
how little the aforesaid excuses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

great Account, the <hi>Catholique</hi> Kings haue to render to God,
of the vsurpation of the immediate dominion of the <hi>Indies</hi>
vnder pretence of amplifying the <hi>Christian</hi> faith.</p>
            <p>The religious zeale of the King <hi>Don Phillip</hi> the second,
father of your Maiestie, cannot inconsiderately bee ouerpast;
when, inuited by the <hi>Pope</hi> hee tooke Armes against <hi>Henry</hi>
the fourth, King of <hi>France:</hi> The cause of <hi>Christ</hi> was in
question, against a publique <hi>Heretique,</hi> and Enemy of <hi>Christ.</hi>
It was expedient that the sacred <hi>Catholique</hi> King, Protector
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> should abandon his owne Affaires of
<hi>Flanders</hi> to defend that of <hi>Christ.</hi> The which <hi>Heroique</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fruit of perfect vertue, which is rarely found among

that the Coronation of <hi>Henry</hi> might bring some danger to

            <p>That is,</p>
            <p>The Euening before the Absolution should be giuen, the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sessa,</hi> Ambassadour of the <hi>Catholique</hi> King, on his
behalfe protested to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that the absolution which his
Holines intended to giue to <hi>Henry,</hi> should not preiudice the
Reasons of his King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that which concerned the Kingdome
of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and the County of <hi>Bourgundy,</hi> nor in the expence
which he had made for the Conseruation of the <hi>Catholique</hi>
faith in the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> at his instance and request,
and that he determined, not to depose Armes, vntill he had
recouered them. The high Bishop attentiuely heard the
Protest, and the <hi>Duke</hi> tooke thereof a publique instrument,
hauing first aduertised his <hi>Holinesse</hi> of some inconueniences
which hee feared might result from the Absolution, which
was purposed to bee giuen to <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Protests did appeare, to men of sound iudgement,
ill grounded prentences, &amp; the alleaged inconueniences false
foundations of that great Building, which those malicious
aboue mentioned did figure to themselues. They said it was
requisite to the strict <hi>Christianity,</hi> which the <hi>Catholique</hi> King
professed, (all humane Interest deposed) to aduance with all
his spirits, the conuersion of <hi>Henry,</hi> and to exhort the high
Bishop, affectionately to receiue the prodigall Sonne, seeing
he was returned penitent to his fathers house, and to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Armes the strayed sheepe, which hee had now found,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17293:27"/>
to carry him to the Sacred sheepfold of Christ: They did
blame, as a work very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Catholique,</hi> but rather as a sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of the <hi>Deuill,</hi> to attempt the hinderance of that Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which onely hee ought to haue procured, for the quiet
of <hi>France,</hi> and the publique good of <hi>Christendome,</hi> which if
it had not succeeded, might haue wholly allenated that
Kingdome from the <hi>Church,</hi> as the like had done in <hi>England:</hi>
They did consider that it was wide of the purpose to feare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
preiudice in the kingdome of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the County
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> seeing the Absolution did not deriue any more
right to <hi>Henry,</hi> then that which any other, which should be
King of <hi>France</hi> might haue.</p>
            <p>But aboue all, the pretensions of the expence made in the
warre, did giue them greatest scandall. They discoursed; if on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of many and many <hi>Millions,</hi> spent, not according to his
obligation, for <hi>Christianity,</hi> but for the interest of his owne
priuate <hi>Estates?</hi> What then doth hee pretend? Why then
doth he not lay downe Armes? Vpon what hath hee fixed
his thoughts? To what end doth he aspire? If he prosecute
this warre, he prosecuteth an vniust warre; How doth that
correspond with the zeale of <hi>Religion,</hi> for which, onely at
first he vndertooke it? What change is this? Certainely it
proceedeth not from the right hand of the most <hi>High.</hi> But
bee it so, let him follow the warre, at his owne pleasure,
there is no remedy, <hi>Henry</hi> shall bee absolued, and shall bee
King of <hi>France;</hi> Doth the <hi>Catholique King</hi> perhaps hope,
with his owne forces, and by strong hand, to depriue him?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17293:28"/>
If he was not able, with the vnion of so many other Princes,
to hinder him from taking possession of his Kingdome, how
shall he now be able to expell him, hauing set sure footing in
his <hi>Throne?</hi> He attempts a dangerous Action. Here they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with witty and politique Consideration, that a good
issue of this warre against <hi>Henry,</hi> not ensuing, hee should be
sure to acquire a powerfull, and perpetuall Enemy, that
might in time make <hi>Spaine</hi> to tremble within her owne bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els;
and the <hi>Prophesie</hi> had well neare beene verified, (the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stay him. But this yet, which perhaps was foreseene, they
did iudge insufficient to free <hi>Spaine</hi> of the danger; Seeing
the offence of the father, and with the offence, the disdaine,
might descend to the Sonne, his Successor, as soone as he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
came to ripe age, and should fall into consideration, that the
<hi>Catholique</hi> King had done his vtmost, to keepe him from
being King of <hi>France,</hi> when hee indeauoured to take the
Crowne from the head of his father: and that if his father,
in despight of <hi>Spaine,</hi> mainteined himselfe King, he also
in despight of <hi>Spaine,</hi> might enioy his fathers Kingdome.
But all these considerations, which certainely were very
great, before any other conceiued them, were resolued by
the most wise King <hi>Phillip,</hi> who by common Iudgement was
the <hi>Salomon</hi> of his time; From whence for the same reasons,
that others did iudge it requisite to leaue the warre, hee
esteemed it necessary to prosecute it. Seeing he knew he had
so grieuously offended <hi>Henry,</hi> that hee could by no other
meanes, secure himselfe from his disdaine, but onely by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him to become King of <hi>France:</hi> Wherefore seeing the
cause of <hi>Religion</hi> did cease, it was expedient to fasten vpon
some other pretence; to resist (with his <hi>Holiness</hi>) the absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Coronation;</hi> and to proue, if it were
possible (already reason of <hi>State</hi> had insinuated that <hi>great

as he had already caused to be propounded in <hi>Parliament.</hi>

            <p>That is.</p>
            <p>For these and other Reasons, together with the Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and practices which were discouered, it was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their Assembly, that the Duke <hi>du Mayne,</hi> as Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Kingdome, should procure to dissolue the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that already were vnmasked; because by no meanes, a
<hi>Princesse</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

anulling whatsoeuer Treaty, which to that day had beene
begunne; and that the fundamentall lawes of the Kingdom,
concerning the <hi>Election</hi> of a most <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> King
should bee obserued.</p>
            <p>Now, let your Maiestie see, from the contexture of the
forementioned matters, to what termes the most holy zeale
of the King <hi>Don Phillip</hi> your father, was reduced, and how
the faire beginnings, for sincere Religion, were peruerted,
onely into an vndue end, of reason of <hi>State;</hi> For which also,
the warre, after the Absolution of <hi>Henry,</hi> did continue, vntill
the most blessed <hi>Clement</hi> the Eight did introduce the <hi>peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could alledge to your Maiestie many other examples vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Argument: but I esteeme these three, so notable, that
they are enough with aduantage.</p>
            <p>There may perhaps bee some, who will reprehend me,
that I haue onely exemplified in the Kings of <hi>Spaine,</hi> where
I might doubtlesse haue beene furnished from Princes of
other Nations, and wil accuse me as a man of little Iudgment,
and maners, that speaking with your Maiestie I haue presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to mingle my tongue in the Actions, of the neuer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
praised <hi>Don Phillip</hi> the second, your father. I would
they should consider, that domestique examples moue
much more then forrain; from whence, as noble mindes doe,
with all possibilitie, endeauour to immitate the Actions
worthy, of their famous <hi>Ancestors;</hi> so, by all meanes they doe
endustriate themselues, to auoid that, which in their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
was iudged worthy of blame; And, seeing that they,
though Princes of worth, and eminent vertue, did sometimes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17293:29"/>
stumble vpon vnbeseeming Actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; they do learne not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
too much vpon themselues, and to bee very watchfull,
not to fall, where others slipt; and considering, that being
their Descendents, they should not esteem themselues better,
but rather worse, then they; seeing in descending, nature doth
loose, as vertue doth encrease by ascending. Wherefore, if
by nature they are <hi>Descendents,</hi> they shall grow worse, and
onely ascending by vertue, they may make them themselues
better. I then, speaking with a <hi>Catholique</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to
admonish him of a snare, now with so much faire and hidden
Artifice set before him, that easily he might fall therein; how
could I better doe, then to shew him, where his owne Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
most wise and <hi>Catholique</hi> Princes, haue fallen head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into like disorders?</p>
            <p>It is necessary (<hi>said the great</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> France) to shew the
errors of Princes,<note place="margin">Pirre Mathiew: en la vie du Mons: Vill.</note> that they which succeed them, may not erre in
the same, wherein others did loose themselues.</p>
            <p>I haue then purposely taken these examples of the Kings
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as more helpefull to your Maiestie in this present
matter, then any other, which might haue beene produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
and haue euer confirmed them with the Authoritie of
<hi>Spanish</hi> writers, to auoid the blame, either of falshood, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny;
And because they may bee of greater credit, and
more efficacie, in the sincere mind of your Maiestie.</p>
            <p>To whose consideration, I at last come to represent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That the Rising of the Gouernour of <hi>Millan</hi> against the
<hi>Grisons</hi> in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> vnder the like pretence, did apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tend to the same end, though shadowed, in the <hi>Manifest,</hi>
much wide of truth, of which I shall now discourse, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
(as it was voyced) by the people of that Valley, but in
truth by the Ministers of your Maiestie, of whom, if your
Maiestie be not more then heedfull, you shall bee certainly
induced to such Actions, that being added to the other
three <hi>Narrations</hi> of your Ancestors, will serue for an example
to Posteritie, of an impious and wicked Enterprise, vnder a
Religious and godly vaile.</p>
            <p>Returning to the Discourse; I say, that the causes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17293:30"/>
that <hi>Manifest,</hi> were <hi>Three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first, to insinuate to your Maiestie and the World,
that the People of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> being tyranni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
were of their owne free and voluntary determination,
and not by others induced, fallen into <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second, to perswade your Maiestie and the World,
that your Ministers had iustly vndertaken the protection
of those miserably oppressed, &amp;, that it was consonant to the
greatnesse and goodnesse of a <hi>Catholique</hi> King, not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
those, who refuged to his defence; So formerly, <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
of <hi>Aragon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sabell. Enead. 9. li. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Non potuisse se aiebat Siculis indigna ferentibus,
opemque suppliciter suam implorantibus, non auxilio adesse;</hi> yet it
was hee that seduced them into defection.</p>
            <p>The third, to render the poore <hi>Valtelines</hi> by so shameless
a writing, so odious to their owne Lords, that they should
despaire, of euer obtayning pardon; whereby they might
rest the more obstinate in their <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and willing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in any
sort to subiect themselues to the Dominion of your Maiestie,
for feare they should returne into the power of the <hi>Grisons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first is clearly expressed in the <hi>Manifest,</hi> which turnes
all things to the iustification of the rebellion of the <hi>Valtelines:</hi>
the other two, which are extracted from the intrinsique
thoughts of the heart, might appeare Imaginations of my
owne fancy, if the matter it selfe did not approue them; But
arguing securely, from the effect to the Cause, true, and not
imaginarie Conclusions may bee deduced: To this then I
inuoke, with all my spirits, the attentiue mind of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie;
for when I shall haue demonstrated, that all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the <hi>Manifest</hi> are ill grounded, and false, and what the
truth of the businesse is: it shall together appeare, that the
Gauses of said <hi>Manifest</hi> cannot bee other, then those aboue
specified.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reasons</hi> drawne to excuse the Rebellion of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,</hi>
are reduced to two <hi>Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religion <hi>and</hi> Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Vpon these are made great Amplifications, but all is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
without proofe; A manifest signe, that it is spoken
without foundation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:17293:30"/>
Concerning <hi>Religion;</hi> it is said that the <hi>Grisons</hi> vtterly
haue taken from the <hi>Valtelines</hi> the libertie of Conscience,
and haue procured, that all should be infected with <hi>Heresie,</hi>
shewing, in euery occasion, fauour to <hi>Heretiques,</hi> and the
contrary to <hi>Catholiques,</hi> vpon some of whom, they haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
most cruell and infamous death, onely in hatred of the
<hi>Religion.</hi> I repeate not euery particular; It is sufficient to
take this <hi>Maxime,</hi> to which all other matters are reduced,
and in the <hi>Manifest</hi> may be distinctly read.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Tyranny,</hi> it goeth painting out a kind of
gouernment of the <hi>Grisons</hi> in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> like to that, which
hertofore <hi>Verres</hi> vsed in <hi>Sicily:</hi> and, to speake more modernly,
like to some, practised as well by the Ministers of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
as of your Predecessors in their <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Italy;</hi> as by
this discourse you shall fully vnderstand; perhaps with some
notable benefit to your poore Subiects, who are waiting
some ease, from your Royall hand.</p>
            <p>But before wee discourse particularly in these two
points, it is fit to consider, That the <hi>Grisons,</hi> though diuided
in two <hi>Religions, Roman</hi> and <hi>Euangelique</hi> (may it please the
diuine <hi>Maiestie</hi> that in time they may all agree in the vnitie
of the true <hi>Apostolique</hi>) yet, in all matters, in respect of the
publique good of the <hi>State,</hi> thee haue constantly stood vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the politique Gouernment. With which Concord
they haue so many yeares maintained themselues free Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
vndependent of other, and highly estemed of all; For
which cause, wee know with how much diligence and
charge many great Princes haue sought their friendship. But
of late yeares, in this part, some Ministers of your Maiestie,
malignant to see them colleagued, now with <hi>France,</hi> now
with <hi>Venice,</hi> moued with an immoderate zeale of your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
to which they supposed that such Confederations
might bring somepreiudice, and iudging it most important
to your Crowne, that you onely should haue the free passage
through the straights of the <hi>Valteline</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> and that
to all other Princes, they should, at your pleasure, bee shut;
haue gone contriuing Inuentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and insidu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us Artifices, to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17293:31"/>
diuide the <hi>Grisons,</hi> as well in the politique gouernment, as in
<hi>Religion;</hi> to the end they might easily slide into vtter ruine.</p>
            <p>To this effect, the late count <hi>de Fuentes,</hi> Gouernour of
<hi>Millan</hi> erected that Fort, which to this day beares his name,
so preiudiciall, as nothing more, to the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Grisons;</hi>
Hauing first with money corrupted some of the chiefe of
that Countrey, to the end, that if the <hi>Lords</hi> would oppose
themselues, they should with various Arts be disturbed; as it
came right to passe by the labor of <hi>Io: Baptista Preuosti, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peio,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Rodolfo Planta; Nicholo Rusca,</hi> and others, noted in the
<hi>Manifest</hi> of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> of the yeare 1618. Instantly after
which, <hi>Don Pedro de Toledo,</hi> Gouernor of <hi>Millan,</hi> in the yeare
1617. did attempt to make a perpetuall league with the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
vpon Articles molded by the Lord <hi>Alfonso Casale,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
of your Maiestie in that <hi>Republique,</hi> after his owne
fashion; In which there was nothing inserted in the fauour
of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> but a delusory promise to demolish the fort of
<hi>Fuentes;</hi> wherewith, it seemed to him, that they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend
to all other things, how contrary soeuer to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.
The same men, who did fauour the building of the
Fort, did not faile to aduance also this Confederacie, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
many, that by al meanes it ought to be embraced; but
the crooked practises of these Patriots, Enemies of their
Countrey, being to the <hi>Grisons</hi> discouered, they would not
accept these <hi>Capitulations;</hi> but forming a luridicary, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall
Processe, against these <hi>Rebels,</hi> they found so many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations,
treasons, and other wicked Actions by them
wrought, that proceeding to Iustice, it was requisite, with
Banishments, and death, to giue them deserued punishment;
From that time, till now, that they remained exiled, aided
with money by the Ministers of your Maiestie, with which
they proceeded, maintayning fresh practices with
their friends and adherents, and corrupting many others,
they haue sollicited continually to sowe dissention among
this people, thereby to raise some insurrection, as finally
hath succeeded in the <hi>Valteline.</hi> The truth of all this is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
collected from the forealleaged <hi>Manifest,</hi> of the Actions of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17293:31"/>
the <hi>Grisons,</hi> in the yeare 1618. to which Credit cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
as the Ministers of your Maiesty desire, seeing the things
therein related are matters of fact, and iuridically approued,
where these affaires haue beene handled without passion, or
respect of persons; as euery dispassionate mind, by the reading
thereof will iudge.</p>
            <p>The intent then of your Maiesties Ministers was not, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
a Confederacy with the <hi>Grisons;</hi> which had it bin so, they
would haue procured by lawfull wayes, &amp; vpon Conditions
reasonable, as other Princes vsed: and not by interuention of
particular persons, corrupted with gifts, and vpon Articles, so
vnsauory, as among them are seene. But their purpose was,
so cunningly to frame them, that they should not be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
because, being promoued by the factious party of men
corrupt, and reiected by the sound part, dis-interressed, and
louers of the publique good, there might arise a discord,
sowed by this art, to cast these people into Confusion, so
that from their diuision, according to the Gospell, the deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the <hi>State,</hi> might follow; For the Ministers of your
Maiestie, fomenting one part against the other, did hope to
oppresse both the one and the other, and highly to merit of
you by enlarging, in what way soeuer, your <hi>Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Artifice (<hi>O Sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed Catholique King!</hi>) to disunite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
from their Princes, to send them into destruction, is
most proper, and practised by the Ministers of your Crowne;
and who would here recount, how often, and in what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
they haue plotted disunion in the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi>
should weaue a large Historie. The <hi>French</hi> Lords doe well
know it, and it is a common opinion amongst them, who best
vnderstand the Affaires of <hi>State,</hi> that if all the <hi>Hugonotts</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> should bee reduced to the <hi>Catholique Religion,</hi> the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers would therewith be grieuously displeased;
seeing that of them they make principall vse, as of most deare
friends, to embroile that Kingdome, whensoeuer they haue
any doubt, that the <hi>French</hi> may moue his forces to the
dammage of <hi>Spaine.</hi> And they doe glory, not to feare at
all, the Armes of his most <hi>Christian</hi> Maiestie, not because
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17293:32"/>
the are inualid, but that they know the way to keepe them
busied, at their pleasure, in his owne house: Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being well considered, might produce a contrary effect.
For, if the most <hi>Christian</hi> King shall once resolue himselfe,
to carry the warre abroad, he shall rest most secure, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
within his owne Kingdome. The great and warlike
mindes of the <hi>French</hi> Nobilitie, borne to Armes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises,
cannot lie wasting in Idlenesse; While they haue
not elsewhere to bee exercised, it is no wonder that at home
they may be easily excited to tumults. But if they shall bee
imployed in foraine Actions, they will runne greedily to
victories and glory, of which they are most ambitious. And
will desire, like wise men, that their owne Country should
rest in peace, to bee the more able with their Sword to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
others: not will they suffer themselues to bee disturbed
by the treacherous machinations of them, who affect their
ruine.</p>
            <p>But this is spoken by the way, by occasion of the like
stratagem at present used among the <hi>Grisons;</hi> the which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it hath begunne to take effect in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
of <hi>Millan</hi> is le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pt into the field, not with intent to
fauour, but to oppresse the party risen; yet to giue another
relish, Preposing still this <hi>axiome</hi> of <hi>Machiauell,</hi> that feined
Religion doth much aduantage the Actions of Princes: hee
would make the world beleeue, that he was moued with <hi>pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
to take the protection of the miserable <hi>Valtelines,</hi> oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
(as saith the <hi>Manifest</hi>) in Religion, and politike life.
Of which two things, it is now requisite distinctly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grisons</hi> doe pretend, that if God when hee created
man, left him in the state of free will, the Conscience ought
to be free, no man being able to take away that, which is the
gift of the <hi>Diuine</hi> Maiestie. They esteeme their Condition
to be most wretched and miserable, who are violently forced
to professe to beleeue that, which their Conscience truely
doth not beleeue: and therefore they require libertie of
Religion. They are diuided into <hi>Roman,</hi> and <hi>Euangelique,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:17293:32"/>
euery one followes that part, to which his Conscience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
him. Euery one doth beleeue hee beleeues well,
and sinnes mortally when he doth transgresse from that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Institution, wherein he was borne and bred: Violence
is done to no man. In the publike Gouernment, aswell
the one, as the other, doe participate without any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.</p>
            <p>Now the Ministers of your Maiestie say, (as may be read in
the Manifect) that the Professors of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion
haue no more libertie to follow their true saith, because the
contrary faction doth tyrannously oppresse them; And here
they alleage many violent Actions; which if in case some are
true, certainly they are not happened, but for grieuous Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and offences first done by the <hi>Romanist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to the <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques:</hi>
but the truth is, that the most part of them are false, &amp;
the effect to this day, hath shewed it to be most false, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the <hi>Euangeliques</hi> did attempt to oppresse the <hi>Romanists;</hi>
Vpon which, for better illustration, wee will with reason dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
a little in the fauour of truth.</p>
            <p>These two Factions, <hi>Roman,</hi> and <hi>Euangelique,</hi> either
are equall, or the one is superiour to the other; If they
are equall, &amp; euery one doe persist in their own opinion, (it
being certaine that in their <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts,</hi> called by them <hi>Dritture,</hi>
the Ministers of the one, and the other, equally are assistant)
of necessitie it must bee said, that when any thing is handled,
which doth preiudice the one, or the other, there can neuer
be any agreement. But seeing they doe accord as it appeares
by the <hi>Diett</hi> of <hi>Tosana,</hi> in the yeare 1618. in which so many
<hi>Rebells,</hi> as well <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Euangeliques</hi> without all respect
were punished; Then it must be concluded not to bee true,
that they practise one to preiudice the other; Then it is false,
that the <hi>Euangeliques</hi> doe oppresse the <hi>Romanists.</hi> But who
shall say that the one is too strong, and doth persecute the
other? How is it, that in so many, and so many yeares, that
part hath not vsurped the absolute dominion? If the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
preuaile, how doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17293:33"/>
affirme, in despight of <hi>Religion?</hi> If the <hi>Euangelique</hi> be supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
how can it stand, that putting to death the <hi>Arch-Priest</hi>

of the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> afterward they admitted another Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and another <hi>Arch-Priest</hi> of the same <hi>Religion?</hi> And
why did they condemne only those two, and not many other
good and truely religious men, of which in that <hi>State</hi> there
are multitudes? Let it bee then said, not to be a truth, that
the <hi>Euangeliques</hi> doe persecute the <hi>Romanists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the aforesaid Clergie-men haue suffered; the tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
by them committed, <hi>in communem patriam,</hi> did cause,
that, with Common consent, aswell of the <hi>Catholique Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
as of the <hi>Euangeliques,</hi> they haue beene punished: as
it is notorious by the aforementioned writing of the yeare
1618. And that it was not done in the hatred of <hi>Religion,</hi>
may more clearely from this be discerned, that amongst the
accused and condemned there were many more <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi>
then <hi>Romans.</hi> Whence it is euident, that with all inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie,
and without any respect, those of the <hi>Euangelique</hi> fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
haue onely aymed, not sparing themselues, at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of <hi>Iustice:</hi> And <hi>Rodolfo Planta,</hi> that then was
banished, as is knowne to all men, was not onely an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,</hi>
but a principall <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Heretiques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With two things about this Subiect the World is greatly
amazed and scandalized: The one, that the Ministers of
your Maiestie in the <hi>Manifest</hi> printed by them for the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolines,</hi>
haue dared to giue the title of a true <hi>Martyr</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> to the <hi>Arch-priest</hi> of <hi>Sondrio,</hi> a man blood-thirsty, and
a Traitor to his Prince; whence it appeares, that onely for
being their fauourer, he obtained the merit, to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for a <hi>Saint.</hi> The other is, that they haue alwayes held
so strict Intelligence with <hi>Rodolfo Planta,</hi> and other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<hi>Heretiques,</hi> and haue fauoured, and stipendiated them,
both before and after their Banishment, and haue made vse,
and yet doe vse them continually in matters very inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
Neither doe they make at all scruple of Conscience
thereof, though they publikely proclaime themselues Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17293:33"/>
of the <hi>Religion,</hi> and perpetuall Enemies of all <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques;</hi>
If the wonder and Scandall bee iust, I remit it
to the Righteous Iudgement, and prudent mind of your
Maiestie.</p>
            <p>I expect, that conuicted with the force of these reasons,
some should step forth, and say; That when notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>Euangeliques</hi> doe not seeke to oppresse the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
and doe suffer euery one to liue to himselfe, yet by all
meanes it is requisite to extirpate the ill race of <hi>Heretiques,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to <hi>holy Church.</hi> I vnwillingly enter into this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
but of force the matter requires that somewhat therein
bee spoken. I doe beleeue, and I thinke am not deceiued,
that to punish <hi>Heretiques,</hi> the Ecclesiasticall, authoritie is
necessary: How then will the Ministers of your Maiestie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
in that, which to them appertaines not? And
who will not say, that greedinesse to vsu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

O God if yet they did vse it well! Holy Church doth
continually pray for the extirpation of heresie; not so of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques;</hi>
But those Ministers, with too much excesse of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
zeale, will first vsurp the <hi>Estates</hi> of <hi>Heretiques,</hi> and destroy
their persons, throughly to roote out their heresies.</p>

            <p>Here a Consideration comes into my head, which makes
me astonished. The <hi>Euangeliques</hi> among the <hi>Grisons</hi> (so your
Ministers affirme, and I beleeue it) are the <hi>superiour</hi> party.
These, as wee say are <hi>impious, wicked,</hi> and our <hi>Capitall Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
they desire our harme, and our vtter ruine. They might
perhaps, haue beene able, with little difficultie, with their
owne force, and with the ayde, of those of <hi>Zurich,</hi> and
<hi>Berne,</hi> obliged to them, by loue by law, and particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation,
vtterly to ruine, destroy, and annihilate the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
faction, in their Countrey, and to become <hi>Lords</hi> alone
of the whole Dominion: And yet these <hi>wicked,</hi> these <hi>impious,</hi>
these <hi>Enemies</hi> of the true faith, haue had so much humanitie,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17293:34"/>
that they haue abstayned; and haue beene contented,
that the <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> liue freely and quietly among
them, and to haue them friends and Companions in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique
Gouernment. And those of <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Berne,</hi> no
whit better then the <hi>Euangelique Grisons,</hi> haue neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued,
nor counselled them to Alterations; On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the true Sonnes of the holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church, instructed
in the meeknesse, patience, and benignity of <hi>Christ,</hi> Men
charitable, pious, and holy, doe make it lawfull to rise against
those, who molest them not; to rebell from those, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them into fellowship of Gouernment; to procure the
losse of <hi>State</hi> to those who being able, haue neuer attempted
to expell them out of the <hi>State.</hi> And the Ministers of your
Maiestie who professe to bee the most true <hi>Catholiques</hi> this
day liuing in the World, are they, who instigate, foment, and
ayd, yea who principally doe opperate, in these so honest
<hi>Rebellions:</hi> and with warre, fire, and ruines, doe pronounce,
that it is requisite to defend the <hi>holy Religion.</hi>

the mind of the sacrificer be auerse, the efficacie is taken away, and
annihilated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Ministers of your Maiestie doe erre in these their
cruell proceedings against <hi>Heretiques:</hi> They too farre wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the path in which <hi>Christ</hi> hath guided them: Let
your Maiestie bee aduised, not to suffer your selfe to bee
drawn into the same error, by giuing them faculty, &amp; power,
to prosecute so bloody Enterprises. Command them by your
<hi>Roiall</hi> authority, to leaue so preposterously to fauour <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion:</hi> For now the world doth know their ends, and
<hi>Christ</hi> himselfe doth hate, detest, and abhorre them: And
when they shall endeauour to perswade you otherwise, bee
not easie to giue them credit, seeing (as I haue already shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
vnder holy pretences, they doe counsell Deuillish acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Let your Maiestie giue full credence to their Aduices,
when they shall perswade you to imploy your forces against
the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> Capitall and continuall Enemies of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie:</hi>
when they shall say, that therein you ought to spend
those many Millions which you draw from the Church for
that holy end, when they shall excite you to dresse your
Fleets and Armies to recouer so many Prouinces vsurped by
<hi>Infidells</hi> vpon miserable <hi>Christians.</hi> But why doe I say reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them? I tremble (O <hi>Sacred</hi> Maiestie) to speake it, but
it may not be passed in silence. I feare that they rather will
counsell you to take from the <hi>Christians; Arzila</hi> in <hi>Affrica</hi>
enforceth me to speake, wrested from the possession of the

<hi>Muley Achmett,</hi> King of <hi>Marocco.</hi> I well know what they
will answer, that he gaue it because he could not defend it.
But if a King of <hi>Portugall</hi> did keepe it, how can it be, that a
<hi>Monarch</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of the new <hi>World,</hi> and of so many other
Kingdomes and Prouinces should be vnable? No, no, wee
are not deceiued: how matters did then passe with the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugalls</hi>

               <hi>Muley</hi> might succour <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> who did claime the

Then againe I say, let your Maiestie take heed of the false

The <hi>Soule?</hi> answered the <hi>Emperour;</hi> What? replied <hi>Leua,</hi>
hath your Maiestie a soule? then renounce your <hi>Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was truly too shamelesse an Impietie of <hi>Leua:</hi> such, I
am sure as none of your Ministers would dare to propound
to your Maiestie; for knowing the great goodnesse of your
most <hi>Catholique</hi> minde, they should be sure to incurre your
Roiall Indignation. But it doth not therefore follow, that
they preserue not in their heads the same rules, and that they
doe not thereby gouerne all their Actions, and thereunto
conformable, addresse all their Counsells, the which are so
much more dangerous, in as much as they couer them vnder
holy pretences, as at present in the warre against the <hi>Grisons.</hi>
Wherefore your Maiestie hath so much more cause to feare,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17293:35"/>
and to take heed, and so much more reason to accept in good
part this Aduertisement.</p>
            <p>But to returne to our Matter; Let your Maiestie consider
that to punish <hi>Heretiques</hi> (as already I haue said) is not the
office of a secular Prince; And therefore your Ministers doe
ill to put their Sickle into anothers haruest, and so much the
worse because they know it. And to deceiue the world, they
make it lawfull without the <hi>Pontificall</hi> authority, to aduance
he standard of the high Priest, to iustifie a warre which they
know to be vniust; Wherefore his <hi>Holinesse,</hi> whose Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is directly offended, ought not, and cannot beare it.
And if hee haue, and doe suffer many other things; in the
end a long abused patience is conuerted into a iust anger. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
let your Maiestie be aduised, that all <hi>Heretiques</hi> are
not to be treated as <hi>Rebells,</hi> with extreame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

worthie of Compassion then of penalty, they deserue helpe,
and not punishment.</p>

our persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them for <hi>Religion,</hi> doth teach them to

the storie is too notorious. What hath ruined <hi>Flanders</hi>

And the Citie of <hi>Naples,</hi> for the same cause hath
it not fallen into generall tumult? which, if it had further
proceeded, to day, by Gods grace, it remaines <hi>Catholique,</hi>
that perhaps we had found, with all that noble Kingdome,

But seeing there is not one particular case obiected,

What may then be said of Gouernours, and <hi>Vice-Kings,</hi>
which you send into remote Prouinces? All the Court doth
know, and the Prouinces are not ignorant, that no man,
<hi>gratis,</hi> doth obtaine these honours, but they all passe in the

Ministers are not so zealous of the <hi>weale publique,</hi> profusely to
expend their owne, to goe and wearie themselues, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
others, though in the most eminent dignitie. Whence
you may firmely collect, that they propose to disburse at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and so prouide that the poore Subiects pay them an

the monies to support then <hi>Tyrannicall</hi> Authoritie, but
of the Ministers of your Maiestie? who hath constantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
them in their wicked Actions, but the Ministers of
your Maiestie? Then it must necessarily bee concluded that
the Ministers of your Maiestie are they who haue seated <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:17293:38"/>
in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and in other parts of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the same designe aboue mentioned, to breed <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Disunion,</hi> and <hi>finall</hi> destruction of those People,
to the enlargement of the <hi>States</hi> of your Maiestie; and all
these workings haue beene carried in a manner so artificiall,
that though the <hi>Grisons</hi> did see many things ill done,
they could not apply a remedie, because they knew not
from whence the euill did arise. So great was the <hi>Tyrants</hi>
power, that there was none found who once durst witnesse
a truth. But at last when it pleased God to bring it to light,
the <hi>Grisons</hi> did not neglect to vse all diligence to dig vp the
euill by the Roote. The Brethren <hi>Planta's,</hi> fled, <hi>Conscious</hi> of
their owne Iniquitie; whereby not being able to apprehend
them, they were punished in such sort as was possible, by
most sharpe exile. Looke vpon the writing so often allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
of the Acts of the <hi>Grisons;</hi> where more distinctly euery
particular may be read.</p>
            <p>But for a demonstratiue proofe of the aforesaid matters, all
the world doth know, how these Brothers <hi>Planta's,</hi> after
their banishment, were alwaies fauoured and sustained by
the Ministers of your Maiestie; how at their Instigation, and
with their helpe, they wrought the insurrection of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline,</hi>
and how, as yet, they negotiate worse actions.</p>
            <p>Here are three things, fit to be aduised your Maiestie.</p>
            <p>The one, the <hi>Deceipt,</hi> which is obtruded by your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
            <p>The other, the <hi>Reproach</hi> which they bring to your Roiall
name by insidious Complots, which they alway extend to
other Potentates.</p>
            <p>The last, is the <hi>Impudence</hi> wherewith they seeke vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
to wound the name and reputation of good Princes,
against whom they haue often prouoked the Predecessors of
your Maiestie, and sometime your selfe, and still doe attempt
earnestly to induce you to actions little reasonable, making
you beleeue, not that they are only iust, but holy.</p>
            <p>Vpon this first we shall haue little cause of discourse, seeing
from the fore-alleaged matters it is euidently collected, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17293:38"/>
the <hi>Grisons</hi> doe not, nor haue not tyrannised their Subiects,
neither concerning Religion, nor in the politike life.</p>
            <p>That all the <hi>Tyranny</hi> which was vsed in their <hi>State,</hi> was
treacherously induced by the Ministers of your Maiestie, and
that the Rebellion of the <hi>Valtelines</hi> was not free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
in them, but practised, procured, and in a manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
by those wicked Arts, I haue fully demonstrated. If
then your Ministers, to promoue your pious and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
minde, to embrace the protection of the <hi>Valtelines,</hi>
and to depriue the <hi>Grisons,</hi> of their Dominions, would make
you otherwise beleeue, who knowes not the fraud? who sees
not the deceipt? It is superfluous to enlarge, because it is too
manifest.</p>
            <p>I come to the second: It is certaine that the actions
of Ministers are attributed to their Princes, and with reason,
seeing it is supposed that they dare not, cannot, as they ought
not, to doe any thing which is not to them either commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or permitted; especially to contriue any great practice,
either secret, or open against other Princes. If then a <hi>Vice-King</hi>
of <hi>Naples</hi> hath once surprised some Castles of the <hi>Pope,</hi>
which after with difficultie were restored: If another did
rob the <hi>Merchant Gallies</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> which yet they haue not
restored; If a Gouernour of <hi>Millan</hi> did once attempt to take
<hi>Casall</hi> of <hi>Montferat,</hi> a Citie of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the Castle of <hi>Bresse</hi> from the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> If ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did leape out to ransack the land of <hi>Cremasco;</hi> Another
did procure to betray the Citie of <hi>Crema</hi> subiect to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:</hi>
If one of your Ambassadours, with intelligence of the
<hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Gouernour of <hi>Millan,</hi> did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinate
a most detestable conspiracie against the Citie of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
it selfe: If now the present Gouernour of <hi>Millan</hi> hath
caused the <hi>Valtelines</hi> to rebell from the <hi>Grisons:</hi> And if all
these things haue beene done, with the Armes, the men,
and the money of your Maiestie, and in times that you
haue professed to bee a good friend both to the <hi>Grisons, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,
Duke</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> the world cannot
imagine other, but that your Maiestie hath giuen these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17293:39"/>
From whence it is publikely spoken, that the King of
<hi>Spaine</hi> doth attend to nothing else, but to raise <hi>Rebellions,</hi> to

his <hi>Royall</hi> name, without any his owne fault, is stayned with
Infamy. I call God to witnesse, that I thus speake, because I so
certainly beleeue of your Maiestie; who deriuing your birth
from the most noble <hi>German</hi> Nation, which by nature is free,
single, and of a minde farre estranged from frauds, deceipts,
and treasons, and are descended from the most famous house
of <hi>Austria,</hi> which hath still produced Princes magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
adorned with high valour, and true vertue: It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble
that you should euer encline the greatnesse of your
minde to Actions so vnworthy. But all men are not able to
distinguish of Nations, nor to know the qualities of Princes;
whence the greatest part, hearing the name of a King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> doe beleeue, that it is spoken of a <hi>Spanish</hi> King, and
doe iudge that he also is such, or rather worse, then are his
Ministers. This is an ordinarie forme of Argument. Thus
spake the <hi>Indians,</hi> when those first Conquerours entred

this Aduertisement, which you will know to be most

            <p>I passe to the third: It is a thing almost ordinary with
them who practice euill, vnder the shew of goodnesse to
make the world beleeue, that others also, when they doe
good, worke iniquitie. For the Actions of the one and the
other, being in themselues contrary, those of wicked men
cannot be approued for good, vnlesse those of good men be
condemned for wicked; whence, vpon their reproach, they
pretend to build their owne glory.</p>

the Brothers <hi>Planto's,</hi> and other <hi>Rebels,</hi> and calls this

much shamelesnesse? It had beene enough, if that <hi>Potentate</hi>
vnder the pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> had done any
of those many Villanies which were committed in <hi>India,</hi>
to describe him in so handsome colours; But who will not
praise that great modesty, which would not by name declare
that <hi>Potentate?</hi> Truely it deserued great praise, if it were
not knowne, that extreame hatred did abhorre to name
him.</p>
            <p>But who doth not vnderstand it? This is that <hi>Potentate,</hi>
which was borne in the wombe of the <hi>Holy Catholique Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Religion;</hi> This is that <hi>Potentate,</hi> that in twelue hundred
yeares hath neuer embraced other faith, other law, then that
of <hi>Christ;</hi> This is that <hi>Potentate,</hi> who since the <hi>Roman</hi> libertie
was lost, hath euer maintained libertie aliue in <hi>Italy;</hi> This
is that <hi>Potentate,</hi> which alone, with iust an honourable titles
both by land and Sea, hath largely and gloriously extended
his <hi>Empire.</hi> This is that <hi>Potentate,</hi> who hath made with his
blood, a Counterscarse to <hi>Italy,</hi> and with his treasure so many
ages, hath and doth defend it from the Rapine of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Enemies of <hi>holy faith.</hi> This is that <hi>Potentate,</hi> which
hates and persecutes all Tyrants, and loues and protects with
all his power, lawfull, and iust Princes; for which onely, it
seemes he is so much hated and persecuted, by the Ministers
of your Maiestie; <hi>A glorious,</hi> and <hi>renouned Potentate,</hi> whose
most noble Actions, exalted to the <hi>Heauens</hi> with immortall
praise of the histories of all <hi>Nations</hi> (I doe not decline those of
<hi>Spaine</hi>) who dispassionately honor Vertue with Truth, are
abundantly known to your Maiesty. From whence you may
well comprehend, that if your Minsters doe seek vnworthily
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17293:40"/>
to blemish that their glorie with defamations, they doe
it out of intestine hatred, which by naturall instinct they
beare to all, who are not to them conformable; in one thing
onely iust, vpright, and sincere: that they are no Accepters of
Persons, but without any partiality deale alike with all men.
And if the <hi>Pope,</hi> the true <hi>Supporter,</hi> vpon whom <hi>Christ</hi> our
God hath founded his <hi>holy Church,</hi> shall not to their will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
they will say, that hee is an <hi>Apostate</hi> and an <hi>Heretique;</hi>
and when yet they dare not so much, vnder other pretences
they will call him vniust, wicked, Disturber of the publique
peace; they will esteeme him Enemy, inuade his <hi>State,</hi>
sacke <hi>Rome,</hi> beseige him in his Castle, take him prisoner,
impose vpon him a grieuous ransome, as if hee were
Slaue and they <hi>Turkes;</hi> They will by necessity force him
to sell <hi>Chalices</hi> and <hi>Crosses,</hi> to redeeme himselfe: and not
therewith content, they will haue Cardinalls in hostage, the
Castle in their power, <hi>Indulgences</hi> for the purse; and yet
more, if more were to be found.</p>
            <p>I durst not certainly say these things to your Maiestie, if
in times past they had not happened: They did thus han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in the Raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift,<note place="margin">Iglies. lib. 2. C. 26. Sect. 8. C. 30. Sect. 2.</note> much against the will
of that <hi>Religious Emperour, Clement</hi> the seuenth: and would

their fury, and the <hi>Catholike</hi> King apprehended a conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
suddenly to accommodate his differences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sacred Catholike Maiestie,</hi> if these things are all true, as
surely they are; reasonably it may be doubted, that like acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will proceed from like persons; wherefore, to the end
you easilie may, as you earnestly desire, vndeceiue your selfe,
and free your name from scandall, and other Princes from
calumny, and the vnworthy iniuries of your Ministers,
which are the three Aduertisements by me proposed, it will
not be out of the purpose, to set before your eyes some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
which vnder your <hi>Empire</hi> are done as lawfull, which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17293:41"/>

shall not end without some profit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ancestors</hi> of your Maiestie haue established in the
kingdome of <hi>Sicily</hi> a supreame Monarchy, both in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
and spirituall; so that your <hi>Vice-Royes</hi> dispense not
onely Offices and Benefices, but also Excommunications and
Indulgences; and who will then wonder that the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Sessa</hi> doth publish <hi>Iubilies?</hi> The great Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi>
hath fully written vpon this Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shewed the vniust possession of that Kingdome;
and that neitheir your Maiestie can hold,<note place="margin">Baron. To 11.</note> nor the Pope grant
it. If your Ministers had found the least apparant reasons, to
answer and confute the doctrine of <hi>Baronius,</hi> as they did of
the passage of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> into <hi>Galitia,</hi> they willingly would
haue done it,<note place="margin">An. Christ. 1097.</note> but failing therof, they had recourse to the fire,
and caused the Eleuenth of the <hi>Baronian Annalls</hi> to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
burnt,<note place="margin">Vrb. 2. 10.</note> &amp; did prohibite it vpon grieuous paines, to all

might as you yet continue to vsurpe the spirituall iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in that Kingdome; as if betwixt you and the <hi>Pope,</hi>
the <hi>Apostolique</hi> iurisdiction were equallie diuided: What
this action may be called, let others iudge.</p>
            <p>But proceeding further, they haue also induced your
Maiestie to arrogate, not an equality, but a Supremacy vpon
the high Priest. So that in the <hi>Censures</hi> which his <hi>Holinesse,</hi>

particular persons into <hi>Castile,</hi> these men refuge to the Royall

            <p>This sufferance of the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp; greedinesse of the Ministers
of your Maiesty: who presume to do alwayes absolutely wel,
when they amplifie in any sort <hi>perfas, &amp; nefas,</hi> the <hi>Roiall</hi> Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,

<hi>Sicily,</hi> and superiour in censuring the <hi>Pontificiall Censures</hi>

the authoritie of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in the <hi>Conclaue</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
for the election of the high Priest; so it comes to passe, that
<hi>Abissus abissum inuocat.</hi> Let in preuaile to speak truth, <hi>ô sacred
Catholique King;</hi> and what else are those great <hi>Pensions,</hi> I
will not say that your Maiestie giues, but which your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
make you giue (because you giue not but according to
their Counsell and perswasion) to so many <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> but
<hi>Simoniacall</hi> bribes, wherwith they intend to buy their voices
to elect <hi>Popes</hi> to their Content, and to exclude those who
are not of their humour? And although this is not done by
way of Contract, yet enough for aduantage to him, who
lookes vpon the intention, though cloaked, yet too well
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17293:42"/>
knowne to the world; And I am assured, that when they
counsell you to giue a <hi>pension</hi> to any <hi>Cardinall</hi> (here I call to
witnesse of truth the inward Conscience of your Maiestie)
they doe not bring to your Consideration, that hee is a man
of good life, and poore fortune, or that he well vseth Riches,
dispensing them to the poore of <hi>Christ,</hi> that hee builds <hi>Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls</hi>
and <hi>Monasteries</hi> for needy, and religious persons; but
they set on the <hi>frontispice,</hi> that he is a <hi>Prince Cardinall,</hi> great
in blood, great in authoritie, great in dependance, that he is
a Subiect capable of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> that hee is affectionate to
your <hi>Crowne,</hi> that he will euer remaine your deuoted seruant,
and obsequious to your will, and such other like; None of
which concerne the good of the <hi>Church,</hi> the honor of God,
nor the fruit of <hi>Christianitie;</hi> but all addressed to the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Interest of your Maiestie. I say not now, you doe ill
to giue <hi>pensions</hi> to <hi>Cardinalls;</hi> rather, it is well done, you
ought to doe it, seeing you giue them nothing of your <hi>Royall</hi>
Patrimonie, but <hi>Ecclesiastique</hi> goods, which are the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and cannot better bee dispensed then to those,
who are the Pillars of <hi>holy Church;</hi> The euill is, that with
this Interest it is purposed, to oblige them to your wil, so that,
at your pleasure, and not according to their <hi>Conscience,</hi> and
Inspiration of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> they should giue their <hi>suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
for the Election of the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, it is known in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; though Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it not, yet the memories of men preserue what
was practiced with the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> their <hi>Confederates,</hi> in the
choice of <hi>Vrban</hi> the Seauenth, &amp; <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Fourteenth, by
the Ministers of the King <hi>Don Phillip,</hi> father of your Maistie;
who glad of the death of the most holy Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift (a
death desired, and by common opinion also, by them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured)
and fearefull of the danger, that another of like
thoughts should succeed him, they did embroile the whole
<hi>Conclaue,</hi> least any should ascend to the <hi>Papacy</hi> who was not
trusty, and fauourable to the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as if to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the good of <hi>Christendome</hi> ought not to be
preferred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:17293:42"/>
               <hi>Vrban</hi> the Seauenth did succeed <hi>Sixtus,</hi> who in thirteene
dayes died. After <hi>Vrban</hi> those of the <hi>Spanish</hi> faction by all
meanes would haue the <hi>Cardinall Palioto</hi> Pope; But God
did ordaine, that <hi>Sfondrato,</hi> called <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fourteenth
was chosen.</p>
            <p>This Election made vpon the fift of <hi>December,</hi> 1590. (your
Maiestie may obserue a most <hi>Christian</hi> and wise Act of your
<hi>Catholique</hi> father) the King <hi>Don Phillip</hi> who was consenting
to the Negociations of his Ministers, dispatched in the
Moneth of Iune following, 1591. to the feet of his <hi>Holinesse,</hi>
to aske pardon and absolution of the Censures into which
he was fallen, by intermedling of his Ministers in matters of
the <hi>holy Conclaue.</hi> An Act as I haue said, most <hi>Christian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was an amends of the error committed, and most
<hi>wise,</hi> because it serued as an insinuation by that humilitie,
to be reduced to the grace of the new Pope, who could not
but bee distasted, as hee was, with the workings which he
had seene, scand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lized.</p>
            <p>Thus the Ministers of your Crowne (<hi>O sacred Catholique
King</hi>) doe negociate in <hi>Rome,</hi> onely presuming by meanes of
Pensions, to hold the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> in bonds; With which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
the vnitie of the <hi>Church</hi> seemes almost to bee diuided,
from whence there is nothing else heard of, to the great
shame and destruction of <hi>Christianity,</hi> but factions of <hi>French,</hi>
and factions of <hi>Spanish Cardinalls.</hi> And although the <hi>French
Lords,</hi> doe not intend particularly to oblige any <hi>Cardinall</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, but leaue all in their libertie; Neuerthelesse those
are called of the <hi>French</hi> faction, who by Pensions, or other
Interests, are not tyed to depend on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and for
them to make a faction; And therefore there is nothing else
done, but <hi>scrutiny,</hi> which of those parties are like to preuaile
in the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> at the <hi>Election</hi> of a new <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I speake so clearely, and so truely, that I am bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
it by their owne <hi>Spanish</hi> Histories. Of the Election of
<hi>Innocent</hi> the eighth, who succeeded <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourteenth,
it is recorded that it passed without any contradiction,<note place="margin">Bau. p. 3. vita de Innoc. 9. C. 1.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

did easilie vnite together; But what shall we say of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations
made in the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> after the death of <hi>Innocent?</hi>

            <p>Behold a confession of the factions, which I mentioned of
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish Cardinalls;</hi> But because at this time
<hi>France</hi> was without a King, and the warre was made against
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the French faction had little credit, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
it was iudged, that the contrary part was easilie able to create

to the perfection of his affaires. That which makes mee
astonished, is, that his Maiestie who had acknowledged his
error to haue busied himselfe in the former Election of
<hi>Popes,</hi> and had with so great submission demanded pardon
of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 14. should in this occasion suffer himselfe to
be drawne anew into the same error; And if the Historie lye
not, your Maiestie also who was then Prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> did
therein concurre; The Cardinall <hi>Santa Seuerina</hi> a Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan,

            <p>And it followes in the History, that the Ambassadour,
which then was the Duke of <hi>Sessa,</hi> was the last that went out
of the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> when it was shut vp; and that if hee had
stayed within, as he was perswaded, hee had secured the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of <hi>Santa Seuerina:</hi> But in respect of modesty, hee
would depart, lest it should be beleeued, that it was managed
with little libertie; a modestie (well obseruing the Historie)
which was no vertue, but a warinesse proceeding of feare,
and confidence: of feare, that other Princes would accuse the
Election of <hi>Spanish</hi> violence; and of confidence, to haue so
well
disposed all matters, that his absence could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall.
For these respects then, hee came out, but within

            <p>From all these premisses (<hi>O Catholike &amp; most mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi>)
the world doth draw one of these two most necessary
consequences; which are, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> either beleeue
not in God, or presume to bee able to doe more then God.
Because, if they beleeue in God, they ought to know, and
hold for faith, that the <hi>Election</hi> of a <hi>Pope,</hi> although made by
mediation of men, is the worke of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> And if
they so beleeue, and neuerthelesse attempt, that the <hi>Pope</hi>
should be chosen according to their will, then they presume
to be able to depriue the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> of that authority, which
onely to him appertaines; who can finde a meane to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile

               <hi>Sacred Maiestie,</hi> I can doe no lesse then speake clearly,
and if God be <hi>Truth</hi> it selfe, God now doth speake by my
penne; This is one of those things which destroy the <hi>Holy
Church;</hi> And a <hi>Catholike King,</hi> who is obliged to succour
it, ought not, in such a manner, concurre to ruine it; I could
add many other things, but because truth produceth hatred,
a cursed sonne of a blessed Mother, I doubt that euen these
few glanced at, will be ill vnderstood. And now I forwarne
this my writing, that for speaking truth, it shall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Be it as it will, I by so much more shall esteeme to haue
done my duty, by how much others shall doe against their
dutie, And God shall be the Iudge.</p>
            <p>But I am too farre wandred, transported with a iust and
holy zeale from my purpose, though not beside the purpose;
And I pray God, it be not fruitlesse. I returne then to the
principall matter of the <hi>Valteline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it should be lawfull for subiects to rebell from their
naturall Prince, to depriue them of their Estates, vnder colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
pretences, while for iust cause, they haue not intimated
a warre; I doe beleeue there is no man of honestie, who is
not ashamed to affirme it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:17293:44"/>
That it is lawfull to Subiects, though ill entreated, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
onely some <hi>Heretique,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 1. Cap. 2.</note> who denyes to holy Scripture,
can speake it; St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle manifestly saying; <hi>Serui
subditi estote in omni timore Dominis, non tantum bonis et mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destis,
sed etiam dyscolis; Haec est enim gratia, si propter Dei con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiam,
sustinet quis trist itias, patiens iniustè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that it may be lawfull to embrace them, when it shall
happen through the occasion of ill vsage, that they of their
owne will doe rebell, there are yet some date maintaine it;
absolutely professing that all good Princes are bound to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
the oppressed, and that the condition of the miserable
should be too wretched, if they might of no side hope of aide;
But to vnderstand this case with Iudgement, it must not be
discussed with these vniuersal propositions, which only shew
a certaine Equity; but it is requisite to reduce it to particular
and proper termes of Iustice. Distinguishing then; wee say,
that that Prince, to whose protection the rebelled people of
another Prince haue recourse, either hee hath right of some
action ouer them, as the Subiects of the vassalls of his <hi>Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory,</hi>
or he hath no right of action whatsoeuer. If he hath
no Action, neither can he receiue them into protection: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
if People (though ill handled) doe contrary to the
Diuine Law, to rebell; against the same Law he sinnes, who
doth fauour and protect their Rebellion. If a Thiefe doe ill
to robbe, it cannot be said that he doth well, who doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
to share in the theft. If a murtherer doe ill to kill, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said, that he doth well who receiues him, that Iustice
may not punish him; And who can then say, that a Prince
doth well, to enterraine the Rebells of another: If these in
rebelling, absolutely doe euill?</p>
            <p>Vniustly then haue the Ministers of your Maiestie done
to intermeddle in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet it were true, that of
themselues they had rebelled; much worse, when euen they,
as is demonstrated, haue with wicked Arts induced them to
Rebellion: But it shall be the worst of wickednesse, if, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all Iustice, they will now possesse it by mayne force,
as they show to desire to doe, seeing therein already they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17293:45"/>
haue built forts, and that your Maiestie doth consent and
approue it; of which the World will iudge that you more
esteeme your owne Interest, then all humane and Diuine
lawes; which God forbid.</p>
            <p>Onely the <hi>supreame</hi> Prince can hold in himselfe such sort of
Dominion, ouer the Countries rebelled from his <hi>feudato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
But when yet they haue not rebelled; and were ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned,
he may, and ought to depriue the Prince his Vassall:
because the inuestiture of the <hi>fee</hi> is not granted for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ruine, but that they should bee gouerned with Iustice;
wherefore if the <hi>feudatory</hi> vse iniustice, and ill entreatment,
he falls from his Iurisdiction, and the Soueraigne Prince may
thereof depriue him; and not doing it, beeing able, hee shall
bee a wicked Prince, and no lesse guiltie of the euill before
God, which he suffered his <hi>feudatory</hi> to doe, then hee the
<hi>feudatory</hi> himselfe is, who acts it.</p>
            <p>Now let your Maiestie apply this doctrine, which is wholy
conformable to reason and law, to the Actions of your
Ministers, to the condition of your Subiects, and to the
right of other Princes ouer your <hi>Estates</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> and you shall
clearely see, how your Ministers are damnable, your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
miserable, and how much other Princes are obliged to
releeue them; My words perhaps will seeme bitter, but I
beseech your Maiestie to consider if they be true, and finding
them so, to take them in good part, as bitter medicines, fiery
<hi>Cauteries,</hi> &amp; sharp lances vse to be gratefully receiued from

be assured you shall find them most profitable; because your

vnder such discretion, goods and honour are dispatched, and

            <p>I passe ouer the burthen of new Tributes, I leaue the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
of Ministers, who like blood-suckers haue exhausted the
veines of that plentifull bodie, because in comparison of lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Souldiers at discretion, I esteeme all to bee nothing;
and he who is able to endure to see them eate the sustenance
of his poore family, and that which exceeds all other Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to grow familiar with his wife, daughters, and Sisters,
it may be said, that he is growne insensible of any iniury. I
remember to haue read in the warres which were so sharpe
betweene the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Genoueses,</hi> that these did take a
Citie of their Enemies, and held it the space of tenne yeares
subiected to discretion: whence it is credible, that besides
other matters, they did dispose of their wiues, according to
their pleasures; for which cause, to this day, though now
two hundred and fifty yeares are ouerpast, there cannot
bee done a greater Iniury to those people, then to call them
<hi>Genoueses Bastards:</hi> and notwithstanding that staine, with
length of time, and the continued peace of that Citie, which
neuer since felt the offence of Enemie, hath beene oftentimes
worne out and washed away, yet vpon euery occasion they
resent the onely memory of that ancient Iniury done to the
honour of their women, which seemes indelible, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
If I then say that the greatest of all the <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
which the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Millan</hi> doth now suffer, is to haue
their wiues at the Souldiers discretion, I shall not speak much
wide of the purpose, because it is a matter very likely, that in

If this be tolerable, let your Maiestie consider.</p>

Duke of <hi>Ossuna,</hi> because in respect of extreame euills,
moderate may be called goodnesse. They exclaime to the

rooted vp. They complaine with miserable outcryes, to
haue more then once sent into <hi>Spaine</hi> to lament to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,

rose in vprore, Many houses were leuelled with the ground,

then those generous mindes be subiected to his will: so that
he did great harme, and obtained nothing. Who shall well
consider these Actions cannot be perswaded that Christian
zeale transported the Vice-King to intermeddle in Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique
Iurisdiction, and to desire to burden that people with
a yoake, little needfull, and lesse reasonable, against the will

            <p>But, certainly, certainly, they are in much worse estate at
this present. I beleeue not (<hi>O sacred Catholique Maiestie</hi>)
that there is any Prince in this world, who, for reason of
<hi>State,</hi> doth not sometimes slip into some indecent Action,
because it may happen, that the Iudgement and the will
are surprised; the one peruerted, the other blinded with
passion and interest.</p>
            <p>To the conditions of Princes their Ministers ordinarily do
conforme; for these are their eyes, eares, hands, and feet; and
therefore, as is formerly said, the Actions of Ministers are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to themselues the Princes; Let vs then say, that
Ministers as well as Princes, may, and doe also erre, either by
ignorance, or passion, or of pure malice; But in all <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
I certainly beleeue, that there haue not beene, nor are
found, any Ministers, of any Prince, or <hi>Republike</hi> whatsoeuer,
who haue committed so great errors, nor vsed so many wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17293:49"/>
dealings as the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Let your Maiestie consider
the few in this discourse alleaged, which are scarce the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
part of those in history recorded, and bee pleased with
attention to read what they haue done in <hi>India,</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
described by the aforementioned Bishop of <hi>Chiappa;</hi>
And you shall clearly see, that to this truth there is no reply;
and with great griefe of heart, you will compassionate the
condition of your miserable Subiects; you will abhorre the
execrable Actions of your Ministers; and as a true Catholike
Prince, will prouide to the whole conuenient remedie: which
if you shall not doe, then that right of other Princes, which
I haue pointed at, will take place.</p>
            <p>Your Maiestie doth know that <hi>Millan</hi> is a <hi>feud</hi> of the
Empire; <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> Therefore the
<hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Emperor,</hi> when their Subiects in these <hi>States</hi>
are not gouerned with vpright Iustice, are bound in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God, either to resume the immediate Dominion, as
they haue the Supreme, or to prouide another Prince, that
rightly and iustly may gouerne; depriuing your Maiestie of
the Inuestiture of those <hi>feudes,</hi> which will bee escheated
by the Iniustice of your Ministers, by you tollerated.
And if at present it may seeme, that the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Millan</hi>
is secure, the Emperour being of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi>
and your neare kinsman, and that you feare not <hi>Naples</hi> and
<hi>Sicily,</hi> knowing the high Bishop most inclinable to your
fauour; yet in many respects, there remaines much whereof
to doubt; The affection of the minde, and the alliance of
blood, with some other interest ioyned to the one, and the
other, are considerations that can doe much: But the loue of
Heauen, and the feare of Hell, and the infallible Iudgement
of God, which will giue the one, or the other, as I beleeue,
may much more preuaile: So that at last, the Pope, and the
<hi>Emperour</hi> will haue more care of their owne soules, then of
your Maiesties satisfaction; I adde, that the <hi>Empire,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
are Electiue <hi>Principalities,</hi> and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hereditarie, whence
if the present Bishop bee obsequious to your Maiesties will,
perhaps his successor will bee contrary. And though now
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17293:50"/>
the <hi>Emperour</hi> bee an <hi>Austrian,</hi> in short time an Enemy of
the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> may succeed him; who finding so iust
occasion, will certainly bereaue your Maiestie of your <hi>feudes:</hi>
and when neither of these would, I may say, God will doe
it, and might alleadg the authoritie of holy men, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of <hi>Sacred Scripture,</hi> but I will omit them as superfluous;
onely this I will adde, that when all other danger should
faile, you ought greatly to feare the heauy dislike of all your
owne Subiects:<note place="margin">Senec. Thabai. Acta. 3. sce. 2.</note> because <hi>inuisa nunquam Imperia retinentur

            </p>
            <p>Let your Maiesty then consider (to close vp this Discourse)
how your Ministers bring your <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> into extreame
peril, both in respect of your Subiects, by their maner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
&amp; with the machinations which they continually
weaue against other Princes; And if euer <hi>Emperor</hi> or <hi>Pope</hi>
should take Armes against you, you may bee assured to haue
all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and perhaps of <hi>Europe,</hi> your <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi>
because the interest of <hi>State</hi> hath opened their eyes.</p>
            <p>Let your Maiestie imagine to ouer-heare all the <hi>Italian
Potentates,</hi> after this manner to discourse among themselues.</p>
            <p>Now what doe we doe? Why doe we not oppose him,
who with a thousand frauds doth aspire our ruine? The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards</hi>
possesse in <hi>Italy, Millan, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> besides
many lands wrested from poore particular Lords, as <hi>Monaco,
Piombino, Corregio,</hi> and others, and yet are not content; If
now they become Masters of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> whereby they
proiect to shut vp the passage of stranger Nations called to
our seruice, and to keepe it at pleasure, open to ioyne with
theirs, the <hi>German</hi> forces of the house of <hi>Austria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this vnion they promise themselues vtterly to bring to
nothing the power of the <hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> the which
being remoued, they hope in <hi>Italy</hi> to finde no other resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
so that thereof they will soone acquire the absolute
Monarchy.</p>

            <p>They conclude the blow is foreseene, we shall be very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
if we be not able to defend it.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>English, French, Germanes,</hi> and other Nations, doe
noe thinke themselues free of the danger, rather they hold
for certaine that the progresses of the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
are preambles to their ruine, and they remember, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi>
after the conquest of <hi>Italy,</hi> did subdue the world;
Wherefore our defence is their interest, and wee and they
for this common interest, are bound, by common consent,
and with vnited forces, to resist, yea to suppresse the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Armies,<note place="margin">Va. Max. l. 2. c. 2</note> 
               <hi>quae oppressurae sunt, nisi opprimantur.</hi> And if perhaps

haue done to those many <hi>Kings,</hi> and mighty <hi>Princes</hi>
of <hi>India,</hi> and from example of others, let him learne to looke

name; Wherefore you ought iustly with them to bee enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and the more, seeing they practizing so wicked actions,
seeke to defame all good Princes with detracting words;
And if your Maiestie doth not refraine the tongues, and
hands of your Ministers, they will yet say, and doe much
worse; not onely against <hi>Secular Princes,</hi> but against
himselfe the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> to whom they desire your Maiestie
should be equall &amp; superiour; and that also you should vsurpe
the authority of the Holy Ghost in Election of <hi>Popes,</hi> that
they may on you depend. In briefe, they pretend that your
Maiesty should be sole and supreame <hi>Monarch</hi> of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and
doe beleeue, that thereunto the Dominion of the <hi>Valteline</hi> is
the direct way, the which cannot by you iustly bee kept,
though it were true, which is not, that of themselues those
people had rebelled; but you are obliged to restore it to their

if it shall be well considered of your Maiestie, you will know

danger whereinto they thrust your owne Estates in <hi>Italy</hi>
the which being continually gouerned with violence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions,

            <p>All these matters I haue hitherto discoursed, and fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to your Maiestie, not with intent, as others haue done,
detractingly to inueigh, to staine your Reputation, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
against you vniuersall ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>red: but with purpose freely
to discouer that truth, which neuer or rarely is brought
pure, sincere, and chast, to the eares of Princes; but viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
corrupted, and adulterated, by those, who by indirect
wayes, without merit, seeke to acquire Grace.</p>
            <p>I know that your Maiestie feares God, loues Iustice,
hates Tyrannie, is content with your owne, doth not couet
the goods of others, doth prize your owne name; desires
Peace, abhorres Warre, wishes the good of your subiects,
the quiet of your neighbours, and the concord of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
Whence I am secure, that taking in good part my
words, and weighing them in the iust ballance of your great
prudence, you will not, that <hi>Truth,</hi> who is the Daughter of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17293:52"/>
God, sent from God, and speakes in the name of God,
should returne backe without any fruit; Let your Maiestie
then command your Ministers, to change their works,
and thoughts, that the Affaires of <hi>Italy</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to quiet and tranquility, and that the
World, from the effects, may know, that
your Maiestie is a iust Prince, and
a true <hi>Catholique
King.</hi>
