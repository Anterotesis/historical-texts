            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE College of Phyſicians, LONDON.</head>
            <p>THE Preſident of the College of Phyſicians, <hi>London,</hi> having Summon'd a College about <hi>October,</hi> 1685. acquainted them that Orders would be given for a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt their Charter, and therefore required their Opinion whether they ſhould defend it; the Queſtion being put by Ballot, twenty three of twenty ſeven of the Fellows gave their Vote for a ſurrender thereof; after which, the ſaid ſurrender was ſubſcribed by all the Fellows, except one.</p>
            <p>The College not long after appointed a Commitee to act in relation to a New Charter to be granted them, which Committee conſiſted of the Preſident and ſeventeen Fellows, who were to conſider what Privileges were neceſſary to be inſerted therein; among which, it was thought to be for the Intereſt of the College, that their number ſhould be increas'd to fourſcore, which being accordingly propos'd in open College by the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, was receiv'd without Contradiction; the reaſons inducing them to augment their number, were</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great increaſe of the City and its Inhabitants, ſince the year 1663, at which time the number of Fellows was by the Charter of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. augmented from thirty to forty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There being a great many Phyſicians in Town of Eminent Learning and Reputation, (who not being of the number of the Fellows might be induced to promote a ſeparate Intereſt, and ſecretly or openly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the College Proceedings,) it was concluded, that it would extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthen the College againſt all Empericks and unlawful Practiſers, if ſuch Eminent and able Phyſicians were by the opportunity of the New Charter Incorporated into the Fellowſhip; and thereby more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to promote the Publick Good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the Incorporation of theſe Members the Society had this further advantage, That whereas the College was at that time unhappily brought into a great Debt of ſix thouſand pounds, no leſs than fifteen hundred <pb n="2" facs="tcp:171694:1" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 1 -->pounds were immediately receiv'd towards the payment thereof by the ordinary Fees and Subſcriptions of the new Fellows; and a certain method provided for the diſcharge of the remaining Debt (twice as ſoon as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways we could have done) by the more frequent admiſſion of new Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon the death or receſs of the preſent Members.</p>
            <p>The only grievance which happen'd (as we conceive,) by this New Charter, (except that Clauſe concerning the Kings diſplacing the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at pleaſure) was, that four or five of the Fellows were left out, not in the leaſt by any application from the Society, but by the will of thoſe who were then in power, as may appear from the carriage of the College to them in that Juncture, who upon receiving their New Charter, (a queſtion ariſing about thoſe Fellows) declared, that they ſhould be treated with the ſame reſpect as formerly. And ſo tender was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the College of them, that though it was often and earneſtly moved that a Catalogue of the preſent Members ſhould be Printed, yet it was conſtantly obſtructed; leaſt by leaving them out, we ſhould ſeem not to own them Fellows of the ſaid College: And as ſoon as the then Government looked with any favour towards them, a Committee of the College (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any application from them,) waited upon the Lord Chancellour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent their Caſe, and to deſire they might be reſtored; and accordingly they were ſummon'd, (as the other Fellows,) to the next College Meeting, and reſtor'd to the ſame Place and Privilege with the reſt of the Body; And an Order was forthwith given that a Catalogue ſhould be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in which their Names were inſerted, and they owned therein as Fellows of the ſaid Society. And ſo ſenſible are the Fellows of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conſtitution of the Factions and Misfortunes that muſt attend their Corporation, if they ſhould be again reduced to their former number, that the Majority of them have under their hands declar'd it to be their ſenſe and deſire, that it ſhould ſtand and continue as now it is, without any alteration as to Number.</p>
            <p>As to the Privileges granted to the College by the Charter of K. <hi>Ch.</hi> II. or any former King, they are ſo far from being taken from us by the Charter of K. <hi>J.</hi> II. that they are all confirmed thereby; and that of K. <hi>Ch.</hi> II. returned entire together with the new one, which new one is not a Charter granted upon a Surrender, but a new Charter confirming all our former Charters, and giving us ſeveral other uſeful and neceſſary Priviledges to our good Government and well-being.</p>
            <p>It is further to be conſider'd, that there is a very great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Charters of other Corporations, and the caſe of our Charter. For the College of Phyſicians, as ſuch, is no ways concern'd in Elections for Parliament, nor has any influence on the publick Affairs of the Nation: Nor as the College was Conſtituted and Confirmed by ſeveral Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was the number of Fellows ever limited by any; that being left to be augmented as the Society from time to time ſhould in prudence think fit: And we humbly conceive that our late augmentation of Fellows would not have met with any diſlike, had it not happened at a time when the general Surrender of Charters gave a National Offence; nor hath the College any Privileges granted contrary to Law, or the Common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Nation.</p>
