            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the <hi>Verses</hi> before the <hi>Text,</hi> we find him directing this Holy man, how he should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in inflicting the <hi>Censures</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> upon <hi>Offenders, viz.</hi> That he should <hi>First</hi> admonish them <hi>openly,</hi> in the presence of the <hi>whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41196:3"/>
to expiate their <hi>Sins,</hi> and satisfie the <hi>Church</hi> for them, <hi>v.</hi> 22.
<q>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens sins.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is a difficulty that has somewhat divided both the Ancient and Modern Interpreters of this passage, To what it is that <hi>the laying on of hands</hi> here spoken of is to refer? Whether to the <hi>Admitting</hi> of persons into <hi>Holy Orders</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> or, as I have before explain'd it, to the <hi>receiving Penitents</hi> into the <hi>Communion</hi> of it? For in both these <hi>Cases</hi> the Ancient Christians made use of this <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Laying on of hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we understand the Exhortation of the <hi>Text</hi> with reference to the <hi>Former</hi> of these, the meaning of it will be this: That he should have a care diligently to <hi>examine</hi> the <hi>Faith,</hi> and to <hi>enquire into</hi> the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> of those whom he admitted into any <hi>Holy Office</hi> or <hi>Function</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> and see that they were duly qualified for it, according to those <hi>Rules</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. iii. 5.</note> which he had before so largely given him for that very purpose.</p>
            <p>But tho I shall not presume to censure this account of these <hi>Words,</hi> yet I must confess I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41196:4"/>
think the <hi>Latter Interpretation</hi> of them which I before gave, as it equally agrees with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and with the <hi>Primitive Custom</hi> of <hi>laying on Hands</hi> upon those whom they <hi>received</hi> again into <hi>Communion</hi> after having <hi>fulfil'd</hi> the <hi>Penance</hi> impos'd upon them for their <hi>Sins;</hi> so does it seem to me somewhat better to agree with the rest of the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s exhortation in that place. And the Consideration which he lays before him to engage him to this Care, is no other than what we find from hence transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed sometimes into the <hi>Penitential Canons</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Church;</hi> namely, lest by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misness in this particular, he should have <hi>Other mens sins imputed to his account,</hi> and be responsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, for all those Crimes which he neglected to punish with that severity he ought to have done.</p>
            <p>But which soever of these <hi>two</hi> be the true meaning of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> charge in the former part of the <hi>Text, Lay hands suddenly on no man:</hi> The reason of it in the latter will be in both the same; namely, that <hi>Timothy</hi> by his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in either of these <hi>Cases</hi> would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd himself <hi>Guilty of other mens sins,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be very careful and Circumspect, that he might not do so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41196:4"/>And this is the <hi>Use</hi> which I shall now make of <hi>these Words.</hi> It is a matter of sad and serious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration that we who labour, the very best of us, under so great a load of our <hi>own Sins,</hi> should yet as if that were not sufficient to ruine us, add eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day a number of other mens to them, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our Account, and aggravate our Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. There is I believe but seldom a day passes, wherein we do not some of us render our selves Guilty in this particular. I speak not now with reference to those, who not only live in an Habitual commission of the most heinous Sins themselves, but take a great deal of satisfaction, and even make it their daily Employment, to draw as many others as they can into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of them. As if they meant to Emulate the impiety of those whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> has characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized, or rather branded in <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> as the most Desperate and Diabolical of any in the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 32. <hi>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in those that do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No, a man need not rise up to such a heigth of Villany, to render himself Guilty in the sight of God, of <hi>Other mens transgressions.</hi> He may be so at a much lesser rate; and that I fear upon such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, as the best of us all shall hardly be able ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41196:5"/>
to clear our selves of it. I shall therefore make it my endeavour in a few reflections to shew,</p>
            <list>
               <item>I<hi>st.</hi> What those Circumstances are whereby we may be most likely to render our selves <hi>partakers of other mens sins?</hi> From whence it will appear,</item>
               <item>II<hi>dly.</hi> How careful we ought to be, of <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>our Actions,</hi> that we may keep our selves from being so.</item>
               <item>I<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. What those <hi>Circumstances</hi> are, whereby we may render our selves <hi>partakers of other mens sins?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the better clearing of which <hi>Point,</hi> I shall in the first place lay down this as a <hi>Principle</hi> out of all doubt; That <hi>no man</hi> becomes a <hi>partaker</hi> of the <hi>Sins</hi> of <hi>another,</hi> but by his <hi>own Act, i. e.</hi> by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which himself does to involve his <hi>Soul</hi> in the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it. <hi>For else,</hi> as a great man among the <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves very well argued, <hi>another</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marc. Ant. l. viii. Sect. 53.</note> 
               <hi>mans wickedness might be my Evil, which,</hi> says he, <hi>God would not have, that it might not be in another mans power to make me unhappy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed so great was the care of <hi>God</hi> heretofore to restrain the <hi>Jews</hi> from an Idolatrous <hi>Worship,</hi> that he threatned for this <hi>Sin</hi> to <hi>visit the Iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children unto the third<note place="margin">

and fourth Generation; i. e.</hi> upon those who could not possibly have been in any manner accessary to their Impieties. But besides that there is a great deal of difference, between being <hi>partakers</hi> of <hi>other mens Sins,</hi> and being <hi>Visited,</hi> or <hi>Punished</hi> upon <hi>Occasion of them;</hi> and that too only with some <hi>Temporal Evils,</hi> such as their own <hi>Sins</hi> had very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served: We are plainly assured by God himself, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> xviii. that even this complaint should be taken away; The <hi>Children should no more bear</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. xviii:</note> 
               <hi>the Iniquity of their fathers, neither the fathers of their Children, but the Soul that sinned it should die.</hi> And in all the accounts we meet with in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>judgment to come,</hi> we are expresly told that every man shall <hi>receive according to his own works;</hi> or as our <hi>Apostle</hi> has Phrased it, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 5. <hi>Every man shall bear his own Burden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains therefore that no one either becomes <hi>partaker</hi> of the <hi>Guilt</hi> of another mans <hi>Sins</hi> now, or shall be <hi>Punish'd</hi> for them hereafter, any farther than he has by some <hi>Circumstance</hi> or other ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd himself accessary thereunto. And our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent business must be to enquire how many ways a man may do so? Now those are <hi>in General</hi> these <hi>three:</hi>

            <p>(1st), A man may become a <hi>partaker</hi> of <hi>Other mens Sins,</hi> by giving <hi>Occasion</hi> to the <hi>Committing</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>This is in <hi>General</hi> so very clear that I do not know that it has ever been <hi>deny'd</hi> or <hi>doubted</hi> of by any. But now how many <hi>ways</hi> a man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so far the <hi>Occasion</hi> of <hi>anothers Sin,</hi> as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himself thereby a <hi>partaker</hi> in the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it, I shall not undertake precisely to define. I will offer some of those that are the most obvious, and particularly reflected on as such in the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And First, He who <hi>Contrives</hi> the <hi>Commission</hi> of any <hi>Sin,</hi> and either by his <hi>Authority</hi> over any other Commands, or else by his <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> Persuades him to commit it; it is not to be question'd but that such a one does undoubtedly thereby render himself <hi>partaker</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>case</hi> of <hi>David</hi> in the business of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> chap. xi<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &amp; xii<hi rend="sup">th</hi>: When having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Adultery</hi> with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> and not knowing otherwise how to prevent the <hi>scandal</hi> of it; he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Joab,</hi> who then commanded the Royal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41196:6"/>
before <hi>Rabbah,</hi> to set <hi>Uriah</hi> her husband <hi>in the</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. xi.</note> 
               <hi>fore-front of the hottest Battel, that he might be smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
               <note place="margin">—15</note> 
               <hi>and dye;</hi> and so he might take <hi>Bathsheba</hi> to be his <hi>Wife.</hi> But tho <hi>Joab</hi> therefore executed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the Enemy slew him as he had project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">—17.</note> it; yet <hi>God</hi> charges neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them with his <hi>Death.</hi> He lays the whole Guilt of his Bloud at the King's door, who had been the <hi>Occasion</hi> of it; 2 Sam. xii. 9. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> says<note place="margin">2 Sam. xii.</note> 
               <note place="margin">—9.</note> the <hi>Prophet, hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his sight? Thou hast killed</hi> Uriah <hi>the Hittite, with the sword:—Thou hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</hi> And then he goes on in the next <hi>verses</hi> to pronounce Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him upon the account of it; <hi>Now therefore</hi>
               <note place="margin">—10.</note> 
               <hi>the sword shall not depart from thy house: Behold I</hi>
               <note place="margin">—11</note> 
               <hi>will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lye with thy wives in the sight of this sun: For thou didst it secretly, but</hi>
               <note place="margin">—12.</note> 
               <hi>I will do this thing before all</hi> Israel, <hi>and before this sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And immediately upon this Admonition we find <hi>David</hi> himself confessing his <hi>Sin,</hi> and implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>God</hi>'s forgiveness, v. 13. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
               <note place="margin">—13.</note> Nathan, <hi>I have sinned against the LORD.</hi> And in that great <hi>Penitential Psalm,</hi> Psal. li. composed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41196:7"/>
on purpose to be a standing memorial in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of his <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> for this very <hi>sin,</hi> he particularly acknowledges himself <hi>guilty</hi> of the <hi>murder</hi> of <hi>Uriah,</hi> and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates <hi>God</hi>'s anger upon the account of it, v. 14. <hi>Deliver me from blood-guiltiness,</hi> O God! <hi>thou</hi> God <hi>of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. li. 14.</note> 
               <hi>my Salvation, and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, such a one as this, is for the most part more <hi>guilty</hi> of the <hi>Sin committed,</hi> than he who was either <hi>over-aw'd</hi> or <hi>perswaded</hi> into the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of it. For tho every man ought to have such a <hi>care</hi> of <hi>himself,</hi> and such a <hi>concern</hi> for his <hi>duty,</hi> as not to suffer either the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Greatest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or the <hi>Insinuations</hi> of the <hi>Dearest Friend</hi> in the world, to be able to prevail with him in a matter where the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Salvation</hi> of his own <hi>Soul</hi> are at stake: Yet there is a certain <hi>easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>tenderness</hi> in our <hi>natures,</hi> that not only too much exposes us to be overcome by such persons as we have either a very great <hi>value</hi> for, or have otherwise been very much <hi>obliged</hi> to, and do what we ought not, out of a false and unreasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them; but does also render us many times extremely <hi>pityable,</hi> tho not <hi>excusable,</hi> in the doing of it. Whilst he who thus executes the office of the <hi>Devil; projects</hi> the <hi>Villany,</hi> and <hi>prompts</hi> us to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41196:7"/>
the <hi>Execution</hi> of it, must remain utterly <hi>inexcusable</hi> both in the sight of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> for his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, A man may be the <hi>occasion</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sin, and so become <hi>Partaker</hi> of it, tho he does not in so eminent a <hi>degree</hi> as this concur to it; if he does but in any other manner truly and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assist him in the committing of it.</p>
            <p>Now this may be done many ways: As, 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. By contributing a <hi>helping hand</hi> to the doing of it: Upon which account it was a Constitution of the <hi>Roman Law,</hi> That <hi>if one</hi> committed a <hi>Theft</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inst. l. iv. Tit. 1. Sect Interdum.</note> by the assistance of <hi>another;</hi> as for instance, If <hi>one</hi> set a <hi>ladder ready,</hi> or <hi>left a door open,</hi> that <hi>another</hi> might <hi>go in</hi> and <hi>steal</hi> his neighbours goods; he was adjudged thereby to be <hi>partaker</hi> of the <hi>Crime,</hi> and stood liable to the same <hi>Punishment</hi> that the other did, who <hi>committed</hi> the <hi>Robbery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same must be said, <hi>2dly,</hi> of him who <hi>counsels</hi> and <hi>advises</hi> another to any <hi>sin;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by puts him upon the <hi>Execution</hi> of it: As if, for example, a man should persuade another in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, to supply his own wants by <hi>stealing</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding</hi> his neighbour of his Goods.</p>
            <p>And especially, <hi>3dly,</hi> If he not only in <hi>general advises</hi> him to do this, but in <hi>particular, points</hi> out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41196:8"/>
to him a fair occasion, to put his <hi>advice</hi> in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As if, for instance, he should not only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel him in <hi>General</hi> to <hi>steal,</hi> but should moreover tell him where a <hi>good Booty</hi> was to be had? How he might get into his <hi>Neighbours House?</hi> What <hi>time</hi> would be the most <hi>proper</hi> for it? And in <hi>what part</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> he should find what he went for?</p>
            <p>Nay but <hi>4thly.</hi> Tho a man should not go so far as this, nor be at all <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>helping</hi> or <hi>advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> his neighbour to do <hi>Evil;</hi> yet If he <hi>gives</hi> his <hi>Consent</hi> to it; If he encourage him in the <hi>Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi> and approves his doing of it; He does even by this render himself <hi>partaker</hi> of the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis upon this account that St. <hi>Austin</hi> charges St. <hi>Paul</hi> with the Death of the <hi>Blessed Steven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serm. de Sanctis. i, iv, v.</note> He was none of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> against him, nor did he <hi>throw</hi> one <hi>Stone</hi> at him. But <hi>he was standing by, and consenting unto his death; and he kept the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts xxii. 20.</note> 
               <hi>raiment of them that slew him.</hi> And by doing of this he rendred himself no less <hi>Guilty</hi> than the most zealous of those that appeared against him. Others cast the Stones at him; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> slew him by their hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41196:8"/>The Sum of this <hi>Second Remark</hi> is in short this: That whatsoever the Means be by which any one <hi>assists</hi> another in his <hi>Wickedness;</hi> if he <hi>knows</hi> the thing to be <hi>Evil,</hi> and yet still goes on to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> the <hi>Execution</hi> of it; He <hi>sins</hi> thereby against his <hi>own Soul,</hi> and shall render an Account to <hi>God</hi> for every such <hi>Crime,</hi> as any Other shall have <hi>committed</hi> by his <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Assistance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I must go yet farther: For,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A Man may be adjudged by <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>occasion</hi> of <hi>other mens Sins,</hi> and as such to <hi>partake</hi> in them, tho' he do's not thus <hi>directly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute</hi> to the <hi>Execution</hi> of them. And that especially by these <hi>two ways:</hi> * By his <hi>wicked Doctrine;</hi> and, * By the <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> of a <hi>bad Example:</hi> And by either of which, if another be led into <hi>Sin,</hi> we find the Person who conduced but even thus far towards it, nevertheless charged by <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Partaker</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> He that advances any <hi>wicked Doctrine,</hi> whereby either to <hi>deceive</hi> Men into the <hi>commission</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> or to <hi>strengthen</hi> them in it, do's thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himself <hi>Partaker</hi> of their <hi>Evil-doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a sad Complaint which <hi>God</hi> once made against the <hi>Prophets</hi> of old, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xiii. That they <hi>prophesied falsly in his Name,</hi> and <hi>seduced his people,</hi> by <hi>palliating their Vices,</hi> and <hi>sowing Pillows under</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41196:9"/>
their <hi>Arms,</hi> and not suffering them to see their <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> saying still <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> and <hi>there was no Peace.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> denounces a terrible Judgment against them for their so doing, at the third and following <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: Thus saith the LORD, Wo unto the foolish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. xiii. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing. Who say, The LORD saith, and the Lord hath not sent them. Therefore thus saith the LORD God; My hand shall be upon the Prophets that see Vanity and that divine Lies, and I will accomplish my Wrath upon them, to wit, upon the Prophets of</hi> Israel, <hi>which prophesie concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and see Visions of Peace for her, and there is no Peace, saith the LORD God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would, I fear, be a melancholy Reflection to consider, how many of these <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Prophets</hi> there are at this time among us, who by <hi>false Principles</hi> and <hi>mistaken Notions</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that I do not add, and by their <hi>open Profaneness</hi> too, by their <hi>new Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems</hi> both of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> fall under the same Censure, and thereby involve their <hi>Souls</hi> in a <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed, What Other Account can we give of all those <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Doctrines,</hi> whereby some <hi>extenuate</hi> the <hi>Danger,</hi> others <hi>cover over</hi> the very <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>Sin?</hi> Some lead men <hi>ignorantly</hi> into it, by teaching them that what is indeed unlawful, may <hi>innocently</hi> be done by them; Others let them see
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41196:9"/>
and know what they do, but then tell them they run no great hazard in the doing of it: A little <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Confession</hi> at the last, and all is secure. Or should the worst that can happen, yet alas! <hi>Hell</hi> is no such dreadful Place as 'tis commonly misapprehended to be: It being unreasonable to think that <hi>God</hi> should punish a few <hi>Temporary</hi> Sins, with <hi>Everlasting Torments.</hi> In short, That 'tis but to <hi>die,</hi> and <hi>perish,</hi> and <hi>enjoy nothing;</hi> and why then should a man trouble himself with the <hi>dull Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> now, when he has so little to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and be afraid of hereafter?</p>
            <p>But let such Men as these know, that it is not a light Offence that they commit in all this. There is a time coming when they shall render a severe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for these their Delusions: And undergo a <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> not only proportionable to their <hi>own Sins,</hi> but to all that <hi>Deluge</hi> of <hi>Evil</hi> which by such <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> as these, has broke in upon the <hi>World</hi> in these latter days.</p>
            <p>It was one of those great Evils for which <hi>God</hi> pronounced that severe Denuntiation against the <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore, <hi>Isaiah</hi> v. 20. <hi>That they call'd Evil</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isaiah v. 2<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Good, and Good Evil; they put Darkness for Light, and Light for Darkness; Bitter for Sweet, and Sweet for Bitter:</hi> that is, they confounded the <hi>Natures</hi> of Things, destroyd all Distinction betwixt <hi>Good</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41196:10"/>
               <hi>Evil, Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice;</hi> they ran down <hi>Piety</hi> as a <hi>vain Practice,</hi> and recommended <hi>Profaneness,</hi> as true <hi>Gallantry</hi> and <hi>Bravery: Therefore as the fire devoureth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isaiah v. 24.</note> 
               <hi>the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have cast away the Law of the LORD of Hosts, and despised the Word of the Holy One of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Man may become the <hi>Occasion,</hi> and so <hi>partake of Other mens Sins,</hi> not only by his <hi>Evil Doctrine,</hi> but by the <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> of a <hi>Bad Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that, not only if he thereby designs to lead them into <hi>Sin,</hi> but tho' he should not have the least <hi>desire,</hi> much less <hi>intention</hi> so to do. For <hi>Sin</hi> being always <hi>scandalous,</hi> and apt to <hi>give offence,</hi> He who do's any thing that he ought not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>leads</hi> his <hi>Brother</hi> from his <hi>Duty;</hi> must answer to <hi>God</hi> not only for the <hi>Evil</hi> that he did, but for all the <hi>Consequences</hi> of it, to the <hi>deceiving</hi> of any Other into the like <hi>Offence.</hi> And thus the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> not only condemns <hi>Jeroboam for making Israel to sin,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the <hi>Calves</hi> that he set up in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> on purpose to draw them away from the true Worship of <hi>God:</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xii. 28. <hi>It is too much for you to go up to</hi> Jerusalem; <hi>Behold thy Gods, O</hi> Israel, <hi>which brought thee up out of the Land
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41196:10"/>
of Egypt:</hi> But represents St. <hi>Peter</hi> to us as <hi>Guilty</hi> of leading the <hi>Gentile Converts</hi> into <hi>Error;</hi> tho' by complying as he did with the <hi>Judaizing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> he design'd only to condescend to their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and not to give any the least <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>Offence</hi> to the Others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Case</hi> was in short this: There were in those first times many among the <hi>Jews</hi> who tho' they readily embraced the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> yet could not presently perswade themselves that they ought to abandon all the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of their own <hi>Law.</hi> With these therefore the <hi>Apostles</hi> thought fit to bear for a while, and to permit them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their former <hi>Customs,</hi> as far as was consistent with the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> so to do. But for the <hi>Gentile Converts,</hi> those who had never been at all subject to the <hi>Law,</hi> to them they preach'd a <hi>Gospel liberty,</hi> and exhorted them not to submit themselves to any such burden.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> being at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in a <hi>Church</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had establish'd of this latter sort, freely for a time communicated with them; not making any distinction of <hi>Meats</hi> or <hi>Drinks,</hi> nor at all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> in any of those things. But it happen'd whilst he was there, that certain <hi>Brethren</hi> came down from the <hi>Church of Jerusalem</hi> to him, who were still <hi>zealous</hi> for the <hi>Law;</hi> and in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41196:11"/>
compliance with these, He began whilst they were with Him to alter his manner of living, and no longer to use his former liberty, but to live again after the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Jews. He withdrew,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, and seperated himself, fearing them of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. ii.—12.</note> 
               <hi>the circumcision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>example</hi> of his led many of the <hi>Jewish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi> who before had lived in all freedom with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> into the like Abstinence; insomuch that <hi>Barnabas</hi> himself <hi>was carried away with the dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
               <note place="margin">—13.</note> And so began to raise some <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances</hi> in that <hi>Church.</hi> But St. <hi>Paul reproved him</hi>
               <note place="margin">—14.</note> 
               <hi>openly before them all:</hi> He charged him <hi>that he did not walk uprightly according to the Truth of the Gospel:</hi> He <hi>withstood him to the face,</hi> and tells us plainly He<note place="margin">—11.</note> was to be blamed: And that for <hi>Compelling the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
               <note place="margin">—14.</note> 
               <hi>to live as do the Jews;</hi> i. e. for encouraging them to it, and perswading them falsly by his <hi>example,</hi> that it was necessary for them so to do.</p>
            <p>It is in the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> now, as it was in that of an <hi>involuntary injury</hi> under the <hi>Law.</hi> If a Man <hi>open'd or digged a pit, and neglected to cover it, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. xxi. 33.</note> 
               <hi>another man's Oxe or Ass fall therein,</hi> tho' he made it only for his own use, and had not the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of doing thereby any prejudice to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet because he did not take due care to fence it, and prevent all occasion of harm from<note place="margin">—34.</note>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41196:11"/>
happening by it, he was to repair his Neighbours dammage, and give Money to him for the <hi>Oxe</hi> or <hi>Ass,</hi> and the <hi>dead beast was to be his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so here: If a Man do's any thing that may be apt to lead another into <hi>Sin,</hi> and takes not that due care he ought to prevent his being <hi>deceived</hi> by it, and another be thereby encouraged to do Evil, he shall answer for his neglect: And if his <hi>Action</hi> was not only <hi>scandalous</hi> but <hi>sinful</hi> too; <hi>Evil</hi> in its self, as well as <hi>apt</hi> to draw others into <hi>Sin;</hi> he shall be called to an account before <hi>God</hi> not only for his own but also for his Neighbours <hi>Soul;</hi> and his <hi>Sin</hi> shall be required yet one fold more of him for the occasion it gave to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do wickedly.</p>
            <p>There is yet one way more whereby a Man may <hi>give occasion to,</hi> and so <hi>partake of other Mens Sins,</hi> and which comes yet nearer to the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Timothy</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> than any I have hitherto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and that is,</p>
            <p>Fourthly; By advancing <hi>Evil Men</hi> to <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and thereby giving them <hi>opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> to do much more Mischief, than they could have done in a <hi>private Capacity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not say how great a part of the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under which the World now labours might be prevented, were none but Men of <hi>great Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41196:12"/>
and <hi>Abilities</hi> suitable to the Station to which they are called, ever permitted to have any Rule or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, either in <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Religious</hi> concerns. Such as these, would not only not do any Hurt themselves, but would in a little time either by their <hi>Influence</hi> and <hi>Example,</hi> or else by a due <hi>severity</hi> against <hi>Offenders</hi> restrain others from doing it. But <hi>when the Blind lead the Blind;</hi> When they who should teach, and make others <hi>Good,</hi> are not <hi>Good</hi> themselves; what wonder if we see so little <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> among the <hi>People,</hi> when there is so little of it among those that should set them an Example?</p>
            <p>It is therefore certainly a <hi>Great Care</hi> that those ought to have, whose concern it is to provide that none but <hi>Honest</hi> and <hi>Worthy</hi> Men be admitted into such <hi>Stations,</hi> where if they are inclined to be Evil, they may do a great deal of mischief to those below them. And if instead of having such a <hi>Care,</hi> as far as is possible, not to suffer any wicked and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Persons to receive any Favour or Countenance from them, they shall either take no <hi>Care</hi> at all, or it may be, (which has sometimes happen'd) be well-enough contented that the <hi>vilest Wretches</hi> should be the most honour'd and promoted by them; what less can they expect than to answer for those <hi>Sins,</hi> which such Men by their means have had the <hi>Opportunity</hi> to <hi>Commit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41196:12"/>When <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> whom we before mention'd, had set up his <hi>two Calves</hi> in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the People no more to <hi>go up to Jerusalem,</hi> but to <hi>worship</hi> the <hi>Gods</hi> which he had <hi>made</hi> for <hi>them;</hi> we read, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xiii. 33. that for the better car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on his design, he provided <hi>Priests for them of the lowest of the people;</hi> such as he thought fit for his purpose, that would be ready for any thing he should command them to do; <hi>whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would he consecrated Him, and he became one of the Priests of the High-places.</hi> And how heinously <hi>God</hi> resented this, we may see in the very next <hi>Verse; And this thing became sin unto the House of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,<note place="margin">1 Kings xiii. 34.</note> 
               <hi>even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because the Great Aggravation of <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am's Sin</hi> was that he admitted such Fellows into the <hi>Priest hood</hi> on purpose to <hi>debase Religion,</hi> and confirm the <hi>People</hi> in the <hi>Idolatry</hi> which he design'd to establish among them; We will look farther to the <hi>Instance</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> where neither of these things can be supposed. Here the only fault we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine <hi>Timothy</hi> was capable of being Guilty of, must have been the not being so <hi>careful</hi> and <hi>circumspect</hi> as he ought, in <hi>trying</hi> and <hi>examining</hi> such Persons as he admitted into any <hi>Holy Office</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> having exhorted him to this Care in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41196:13"/>
the <hi>former part of the Text,</hi> if we take his <hi>words</hi> in that <hi>sense</hi> in which they are more generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man;</hi> makes use of this consideration to enforce it upon Him in the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that otherwise he should be responsible to <hi>God</hi> for all that mischief which should accrue to the <hi>Church</hi> by the means of such persons as he admitted into the <hi>Government</hi> of it, without that due Caution he ought to have used in a matter of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; <hi>Neither be thou partaker of other mens sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall conclude this <hi>point</hi> with that advice which the <hi>Heathen Orator</hi> once gave to his Friend: <hi>If you</hi>
               <note place="margin">Is<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>should ever come to be in Authority,</hi> says he, <hi>Employ no wicked Person in any of your Affairs; for whatsoever faults He commits, the blame will be sure to fall on you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this may serve for the <hi>first way</hi> whereby we may become <hi>partakers of other Mens Sins,</hi> viz. by <hi>giving Occasion</hi> to the <hi>Committing</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>The (<hi>2d.</hi>) is, By our <hi>Approving</hi> of them <hi>when Committed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this too is a <hi>Circumstance</hi> which renders a<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Rom. Hom. <hi>V.</hi> pag. 46, 47.</note> Man not only <hi>partaker of anothers Sin,</hi> but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more <hi>heinously guilty</hi> than He who committed it. A Man may fall into <hi>Sin</hi> by <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise;</hi> may be hurried on by his <hi>Passions,</hi> and carried away in such a manner by the <hi>violence</hi> of <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41196:13"/>
as not to be able to command Himself, and to withstand the force of them. And this tho' it will not <hi>altogether excuse,</hi> yet will <hi>lessen</hi> and <hi>exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate</hi> a Mans <hi>Guilt;</hi> will render him tho' not <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> yet not <hi>extremely ill:</hi> He may <hi>Commit the Sin,</hi> and yet be so far from being <hi>pleased</hi> with it, that he may <hi>abhor</hi> himself for <hi>Committing</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But there can be no Excuse for any one to <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> and <hi>approve</hi> what he <hi>knows</hi> to <hi>be Evil.</hi> Here is no room for <hi>passion</hi> or <hi>surprise:</hi> In short, it must be the Evidence of a <hi>Soul</hi> harden'd in wickedness, not only to <hi>do</hi> what is <hi>Evil,</hi> but to <hi>take pleasure</hi> in it; and to <hi>applaud</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> the practise of it.</p>
            <p>Now two ways there are whereby we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our <hi>Approbation</hi> of anothers <hi>Sin:</hi> and by both, but especially by the former of which, we shall be sure to render our selves <hi>partakers</hi> of it.</p>

He desired by any means to have purchased <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both's Vineyard,</hi> and he was much discontented be cause he could not perswade Him to part with it <hi>He laid him down upon his Bed, and turned away his</hi>

               <hi>face, and would eat no bread;</hi> but it does not Appear that he at all design'd by any unjust Violence to ravish it from Him.</p>
            <p>But his <hi>Wife</hi> wrote Letters to the <hi>Elders</hi> of his <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and commanded them <hi>saying; Proclaim a Fast,</hi>

               <hi>men, sons of Belial, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the King; and then carry him out, and stone him that he may die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This they did, and put him to <hi>death</hi> accordingly:<note place="margin">—11.</note> And then the <hi>Queen</hi> first made her Husband ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted<note place="margin">—15.</note> with what was done. But what then was <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Crime? Why, he received the News with satisfaction; he was pleased with what had pass'd; <hi>and he rose up from his bed, and went down to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi>
               <note place="margin">—16.</note> 
               <hi>of the Vineyard.</hi> And for this <hi>God</hi> charges him by <hi>Elijah</hi> with all the <hi>Violence</hi> that without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge had been before committed. <hi>Thus saith the</hi>

               <hi>LORD, Hast thou killed and also taken possession?</hi> therefore, <hi>In the place where dogs licked the blood of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, <hi>shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, so great is the <hi>Equity</hi> of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, that we find even the <hi>positive Laws</hi> of most
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41196:14"/>
               <hi>Cuntries,</hi> to observe the same measure. He that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals</hi> a <hi>Thief,</hi> and <hi>receives</hi> what is <hi>stollen,</hi> and <hi>partakes</hi> with him in his <hi>Booty;</hi> shall, if discovered, be look'd upon as if he had <hi>committed</hi> the <hi>Theft:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Solomon</hi> says of such a one, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxix. 24. That <hi>he hateth his own Soul,</hi> that is, He puts his Life in danger by it. And for what concerns the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> is even by the <hi>Heathen Moralists</hi> themselves<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

And the Reason of this is clear, Because by joining with the <hi>Sinner</hi> at the last, and <hi>partaking</hi> with him in the <hi>Advantage</hi> for which the Villany was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, instead of correcting him for it himself, or bringing him forth to a publick Punishment; he plainly declares his <hi>Consent</hi> to what was done, and both <hi>preserves</hi> him, and <hi>encourages</hi> him to do the like again.</p>
            <p>Nay but, 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, Tho' we should not make any <hi>Advantage</hi> to our selves by the <hi>Sins</hi> of others; yet our very <hi>justifying</hi> and <hi>applauding</hi> of them, would of themselves be sufficient, to render <hi>us partakers of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Malignity of <hi>Sin</hi> lies not so much in what we do, as in the <hi>Affections</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> with which we do it. The <hi>outward Act</hi> may <hi>accidentally</hi> add indeed to the <hi>Aggravation</hi> of our <hi>Guilt:</hi> But 'tis the <hi>Heart</hi> and the <hi>Affections</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41196:15"/>
of that to which <hi>God</hi> principally looks; and for which we shall either be <hi>acquitted</hi> or <hi>condemn'd</hi> at the last day. A man may do that which is in its self very <hi>innocent,</hi> and yet commit a great <hi>Sin</hi> by doing it, if he <hi>thought</hi> it to be <hi>Evil,</hi> and yet did it. And on the other side, there are such <hi>Circumstances</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what is in its self <hi>unlawful,</hi> may yet without <hi>Sin</hi> be done by us, if a man were <hi>invincibly,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>excusably, ignorant</hi> that it was so.</p>
            <p>He that <hi>loves</hi> any <hi>Evil,</hi> and wishes for an <hi>Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> to commit it, and would be sure to embrace it if he had, is already <hi>guilty</hi> of it, tho' he should never find the Opportunity he desires for it. Thus in the <hi>Instances</hi> which our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> himself gives us, <hi>Matth.</hi> v. <hi>He that looks upon a woman to lust</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. v. 28.</note> 
               <hi>after her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart: He that is angry with his brother,</hi> and would do<note place="margin">—22.</note> him a mischief if he could, is already a <hi>Murderer,</hi> though he never should be able to strike his Ponyard into his Breast. And therefore in the <hi>Case</hi> before us; If when a <hi>Sin</hi> is done by another, We are pleased with it, we <hi>commend</hi> the <hi>Fact,</hi> and so declare our selves to be in our <hi>Hearts consenting</hi> to it; we evidently thereby, as far as concerns our <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Inclinations,</hi> bear a <hi>part</hi> in it, and shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be accounted in <hi>God's sight</hi> to have a share in the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41196:15"/>Hence it is that we may observe, how studious Good men have always shew'd themselves, in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very <hi>Conversation</hi> of <hi>Sinners:</hi> As if their <hi>keeping company</hi> with <hi>Evil men,</hi> should seem to some an <hi>Approving</hi> of their <hi>Evil Actions.</hi> It was the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Holy David,</hi> Psal. ci. that he would not suffer any <hi>wicked man to stand before him,</hi> to <hi>dwell in his House,</hi> or <hi>receive</hi> the least <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from him.</hi> And in the cxix<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Psalm, v.</hi> 115. he makes it the Consequence of his own resolving to be Good, to drive all such from him as would not be so in like manner with him: <hi>Depart from me ye Evil-doers, I will keep the Commandments of my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same was the Advice which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Ep. v. 11. He bids them not to keep company with a <hi>wicked Christian: If any man,</hi> says he, <hi>that is called a Brother be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with such a One no not to Eat.</hi> And again, in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> c. iii. having set down a <hi>large Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Sinners</hi> that should rise up in the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days;</hi> he bids us, <hi>ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>And tho' I should be very unwilling to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any thing rashly in a <hi>Matter</hi> of such a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and am sensible there are many <hi>Cases;</hi> some wherein a man cannot avoid having to do with <hi>wicked men,</hi> as in the Common Concerns and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this World: Others in which a man may worthily keep company with them, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> did with the <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners heretofore,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to gain some Opportunity to reclaim their <hi>Manners,</hi> and convert them from their <hi>Evil ways:</hi> Yet I cannot but think it worth the while of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> to consider with himself, how he will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be able to excuse himself hereafter to <hi>God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> that he has <hi>received, loved, embraced</hi> the most <hi>profligate Sinners;</hi> shewn his <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Countenance</hi> to the most <hi>daring Rebels</hi> against <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> and <hi>delighted</hi> in the <hi>Conversation</hi> of those now, whose <hi>Portion</hi> he <hi>deprecates,</hi> and whose <hi>Companion</hi> he would be very unwilling to become at all adventures hereafter. Nay perhaps has done yet more than this: has <hi>loved</hi> them for their very <hi>Vices;</hi> been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with their <hi>Prosaneness</hi> and <hi>Debauchery;</hi> and smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sometimes at those <hi>Sins</hi> in others, which he would have been <hi>ashamed</hi> to <hi>commit</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41196:16"/>But I must not insist upon all these things: and therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> and to conclude this whole matter; The last <hi>Circumstance,</hi> whereby we may become <hi>partakers of other mens Sins,</hi> is, By <hi>neglecting to hinder them from committing them,</hi> when we <hi>might,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to have done it.</p>
            <p>Now tho this be a <hi>circumstance</hi> which seems more especially to regard those whom God hath set up as <hi>Watchmen</hi> over the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> yet is there no one that must think himself altogether unconcern'd in it. We all of us I hope have, I am sure we all of us should have the same <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and the same <hi>Charity</hi> for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Souls.</hi> And tho' God has indeed in a particular manner appointed some certain Persons to <hi>watch</hi> more than others for your Salvation, and to call upon you to look to your selves, and not give way to the <hi>Tempter:</hi> yet whosoever he be that sees ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about to do that which he knows will be <hi>odious</hi> to <hi>God, scandalous</hi> to <hi>Good men,</hi> and without a timely <hi>Repentance</hi> ruinous to his own <hi>Soul,</hi> and has an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to admonish him of his <hi>Sin,</hi> and to <hi>hinder</hi> his <hi>committing</hi> of it, and yet neglects so to do; let him fear, lest what God <hi>once</hi> denounc'd against the <hi>Prophet Ezekiel</hi> heretofore, be finally verified in himself; c. 33. 8. <hi>When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41196:17"/>
thou shalt surely die, if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his Iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though we are therefore all of us obliged, as we tender our own <hi>Souls,</hi> to do what we can in our several Capacities to save others; and in order thereunto should <hi>hinder</hi> them from <hi>sinning,</hi> whenever it lies in our power so to do: Yet it is not to be doubted, but that such persons as either by <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Friendship,</hi> or any the like Engagement, ought to have a more particular concern than others, for their Neighbours Welfare; or else by their <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Business,</hi> and <hi>Character,</hi> are engaged in a more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner to <hi>watch</hi> over them, should be more than ordinarily careful as to this matter, and will have much more than others to answer for, if they be not.</p>
            <p>And two waies in <hi>general</hi> there are, whereby such persons must labour to <hi>hinder</hi> Men from <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> as ever they mean to clear themselves from being <hi>Partakers</hi> in their <hi>Iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By <hi>discouraging Sin</hi> all they can <hi>before it be committed:</hi> By setting forth the <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness</hi> of it now, and the great danger that shall certainly be the consequence of it hereafter: By shewing the <hi>Vanity</hi> of all those little <hi>Pretences,</hi> in which <hi>wicked Men</hi> are apt to put their <hi>trust;</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41196:17"/>
not leaving them any <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>Impunity,</hi> either in this World or in the next, without a <hi>true Repentance</hi> of their <hi>Sins,</hi> and a <hi>Reformation</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By a severe <hi>Enquiry</hi> into, and <hi>Punishment</hi> of it after. This indeed is what the great <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> of our <hi>present Discipline,</hi> that I do not say some Defect in it, permits not us, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> here commanded <hi>Timothy</hi> to do. We cannot call <hi>Sinners</hi> publickly into the <hi>Church,</hi> and lay open their <hi>Crimes</hi> to them, and <hi>rebuke them before All, that others also may fear.</hi> But the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> has great opportunities of supplying this <hi>Defect;</hi> and no doubt God will require it so much the more at their hands, in that it is now no longer in ours. There is indeed a <hi>Mercy</hi> to be remembred and shewn in <hi>Judgment;</hi> and our own <hi>Frailty</hi> ought to admonish us to make great Allowances for other mens <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi> But there may be an Excess even in <hi>Good Nature</hi> it self; and whatever the Consequence be, care must be taken that neither the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God</hi> be profan'd, nor his <hi>Laws</hi> despised; that neither <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> be <hi>run down,</hi> nor <hi>Vice encouraged:</hi> And to that end Men must be kept from <hi>open</hi> and <hi>scandalous Sins</hi> at least, if they cannot from others; and be punish'd even in <hi>Mercy</hi> now, that if possible they may be reform'd, and so not <hi>perish for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41196:18"/>And let us then</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> Which was the other <hi>general point</hi> we proposed to consider (the consequent <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of all these <hi>Reflections</hi>) be perswaded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour what in us lies to <hi>prevent</hi> both our <hi>own</hi> and <hi>other mens Sins.</hi> Instead of <hi>Approving</hi> and <hi>Encouraging</hi> any in their <hi>Wickedness.</hi> let us, as our <hi>Apostle</hi> advises, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24. <hi>Consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works.</hi> Instead of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them any occasion, or laying any <hi>stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block</hi> in their way, whereby to lead them into <hi>Sin,</hi> let us by our good Example both teach them what they ought to do, and if possible, make them in <hi>love</hi> with it. And let us look upon our selves to lie under the same Engagement to <hi>God</hi> for one another, that <hi>Judah</hi> once took upon himself for his Brother <hi>Benjamin, Gen.</hi> 43. 9. <hi>Of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sensible that I am now exhorting you to a <hi>Duty</hi> but very little, if at all, consider'd by most Men. We think it to be enough for us to <hi>search out our own Souls,</hi> and account with <hi>God</hi> for our own Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: And may perhaps be ready to complain of this as some new Contrivance against your <hi>Liberty,</hi> to call upon you to <hi>repent</hi> for <hi>other
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41196:18"/>
Men's sins.</hi> But if the <hi>Case</hi> be indeed so as the <hi>Text</hi> plainly implies, and as I think I may presume to say, I have in some measure made it appear to be: If there be many waies by which we may, and by some or other of which it is probable the very best of us have rendred our selves <hi>partakers of other Mens sins:</hi> Then I am sure it must remain, that we have a concern to look beyond our own particular Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and to enquire to how many <hi>sins</hi> of others we may have contributed by any of these means I have before mentioned; and the less we have been wont to do this heretofore, it will argue the <hi>greater,</hi> not lesser necessity for us to set very seriously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it now.</p>
            <p>It is indeed an amazing Reflection to sit down and think, How much more <hi>Guilt</hi> we may possibly contract by every <hi>sin</hi> that we commit, than we are any of us <hi>willing</hi> to believe, or it may be able to comprehend. For not to say any thing at all of those common <hi>Aggravations,</hi> which we are every where taught to <hi>examine</hi> our selves about: Such as <hi>sinning</hi> against <hi>Knowledg,</hi> against the <hi>Checks</hi> of our <hi>own Consciences,</hi> and the <hi>Motions</hi> of <hi>God's Holy Spirit</hi> to the contrary: <hi>sinning</hi> against <hi>often repeated Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> against the most <hi>serious Resolutions,</hi> against the most <hi>solemn</hi> and <hi>sacred Vows</hi> of <hi>Obedience:</hi> In a word, <hi>sinning</hi> against many <hi>providential Admonitions;</hi> such
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41196:19"/>
as <hi>Trouble, Afflictions, Losses, Sickness,</hi> and the like; sent by <hi>God</hi> on purpose to reclaim us. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider only this one thing now before us, How many <hi>Men</hi> our <hi>sinning</hi> may be the <hi>Ruine</hi> of? How many <hi>souls</hi> may, for ought we know, perish by <hi>our means?</hi> And what a desperate increase this must add to our own <hi>Guilt?</hi> For if he who <hi>converts a sinner</hi>
               <note place="margin">James v. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>from the Error of his way,</hi> and so is instrumental to the <hi>saving</hi> but of <hi>one soul</hi> from death, shall for that <hi>cover a multitude of his own sins:</hi> O! then, how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally must we <hi>multiply evil</hi> against our selves, when by our <hi>neglect</hi> of our <hi>duty</hi> we lead perhaps Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes into <hi>error,</hi> and involve their <hi>souls</hi> in <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we have therefore hitherto neglected so serious a <hi>Consideration;</hi> If our <hi>Repentance</hi> has been only for the <hi>sins</hi> we our selves have committed, without any regard to the <hi>Mischief</hi> we may have done our <hi>Brother</hi> by them; Let us now at least be perswaded to think that we have yet one great part of our <hi>Humiliation</hi> still behind; to <hi>deprecate God's Wrath</hi> not only for our <hi>selves</hi> but for <hi>others</hi> too; and implore his Forgiveness of all those <hi>sins</hi> which have ever by our means been committed by any in the world, and that he would not impute them either to their, or our Damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:41196:19"/>This if we do with that affectionate earnestness as becomes so great an <hi>Aggravation,</hi> I am perswaded we shall not only very much <hi>increase</hi> our <hi>Contrition,</hi> and so <hi>perfect</hi> our <hi>Repentance</hi> for <hi>what</hi> is <hi>past;</hi> but may also by the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> establish our selves the better against <hi>returning</hi> to our <hi>Evil Waies</hi> for the <hi>Time</hi> to come. And our desires not <hi>to partake in other Men's sins,</hi> be improved into one <hi>Motive</hi> more, to keep us from continuing in our own.</p>
            <p>I shall <hi>conclude</hi> this Discourse, after the <hi>same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and almost in the <hi>same Words</hi> that S. <hi>Basil</hi> once did his <hi>Canonical Epistle</hi> to <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> upon the occasion of that very Reflection we have now been making.

                  <p>Let us call to mind the Admonitions of God to us; What Evils we have been exposed to, What Calamities we have suffered: And let these convince us, That for the Iniquities of our Lives we have been forsaken by him.</p>
                  <p>Our People have been led into Captivity, our Brethren dispersed far and near; Because those who profess the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> have yet lived so contrary to their <hi>Profession,</hi>

                  <p>Nevertheless, let us not cease Day nor Night, in Publick and in Private, to intreat and beseech them to consider these things; but let us not be drawn away with their Wickedness.</p>
                  <p>Let us wish and pray, That if it shall please God we may yet gain them at the last, and deliver them out of the Snares of the Devil: but if this we cannot do, yet at least let us save our own Souls, thô we cannot theirs, and not partake with them in their <hi>sins,</hi> lest we also partake with them in their <hi>Destruction.</hi>
