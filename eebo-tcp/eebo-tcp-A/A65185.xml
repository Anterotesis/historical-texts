            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ON <hi>Whitſun-Eve,</hi> May 24. 1572. Captain <hi>Drake</hi> in the <hi>Paſcha</hi> of <hi>Plimouth</hi> of 70. Tuns, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, with the <hi>Swan</hi> of the ſaid Port of 25 Tuns, his Vice-Admiral in which his Brother <hi>John Drake</hi> was Captain, ſet ſail, having in both of them of Men and Boys 73. ſufficiently provided with Neceſſaries for ſuch a Voyage.</p>
            <p>The Wind continuing at N. E. gave us very good Paſſage, ſo that in five Weeks after, we had ſight of the Iſland of <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupe,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93865:5"/>
one of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> Iſlands. The next Morning <hi>June</hi> 29th. entring between <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minica</hi> and <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> we deſcried 2 Canows coming from a rocky Iſland 3 Leagues off <hi>Dominica.</hi> Landing on the South ſide of it, we remained three days there to refreſh our men, and to water our Ships. There we ſaw ſome poor Cottages built with <hi>Palmito</hi> Boughs and Branches, but no Inhabitants; the Cottages (probably) ſerving only for the uſe of thoſe that came thither at certain times to fiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 1. being the <hi>3d.</hi> day after, about 3 in the Afternoon wé ſailed thence for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> and the fifth day we ſaw the high land of <hi>Sancta Martha;</hi> but we directed our Courſe for a Place, called by our Captain in his former Voyage, <hi>Port Pheſant,</hi> by reaſon of the great ſtore of thoſe Fowls, he and his Company had there, where we arrived in ſix days. It is a round Bay, and ſafe Harbour, not paſt half a Cables length over at the mouth, but within 8, or 10 every way, of 10, or 12 fathom water, full of good Fiſh, and of a fruitful ſoil.</p>
            <p>At our entrance here, our Captain having left his Brother to attend the Ships, with ſome few of his Company went to land. But as we were rowing aſhore, we ſaw a Smoke in the Woods near the place our Captain fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93865:5"/>
therefore our Captain thought fit <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o take more ſtrength with us, ſuſpecting ſome Enemy there. But this ſmoke was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a Fire, which one Mr. <hi>Garret</hi> of <hi>Plimouth</hi> and his Company had made, and had continued at leaſt five days before our Arrival. This <hi>John Garret</hi> left a Plate of Lead nailed to a huge Tree of near five Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom about, in which were Engraven theſe words:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

I departed from hence this preſent</hi> 7th. <hi>of</hi> July, 1572.</p>

            <p>Yet our Captain Reſolved to tarry here ſtill he had built his <hi>Pinnaces;</hi> and therefore cauſed the <hi>Pinnaces</hi> to be brought aſhore for the Carpenters to ſet up, employing the reſt of his Company in fortifying a place he had choſen out to work in, being 3 Rudes, which he did, with Trees, thirty foot in height, round, leaving only one Gate to iſſue at, near the Water-ſide, which was every night ſhut up with a Tree drawn croſs it. The Plat
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93865:6"/>
was of a <hi>Pentagonal</hi> form; two Angles were towards the Sea, and that ſide between them left open for launching our <hi>Pinnaces;</hi> the other four ſides were firmly cloſed up. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ground was rid fifty foot round. The reſt was very thick with Trees, of which many were of thoſe kinds, that are never without green leaves, till they are dead at the Root, (but there is one kind among them like our Aſh, which when the Sun is vertical to them, and cauſeth great Rains, caſts all its leaves in three days, and in ſix days again becomes all green) of a prodigious height, ſupported with ſix Buttreſſes growing out of their Body, in each of which three men may be ſo hid, that they who ſtand in the next Buttreſs ſhall not ſee them. The Wood of thoſe Trees is as heavy as Braſil, or <hi>Lignum Vitae,</hi> and is of a white Colour.</p>
            <p>The day after our arrival, there came an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bark of the Iſle of <hi>Wight, James Rawſe</hi> Captain, and <hi>John Overy</hi> Maſter, with thirty men. They brought in with them a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Carvel of <hi>Sivel</hi> (taken the day before) and a Shallop taken at <hi>Cape Blanch.</hi> This Captain was deſirous to joyn with ours, and was received accordingly.</p>
            <p>July 20. Seven days after his coming, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſpatched our Buſineſs, we departed from that Harbour towards <hi>Nombre de Dios;</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93865:6"/>
within three days we arrived at the Iſles of <hi>Pinos,</hi> and found two Frigates of <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> lading Timber thence.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Negroes</hi> in theſe Frigats we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the State of the Town, and of a Report, that certain Soldiers were daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Governour of <hi>Panama</hi> for the defence of the Town againſt the <hi>Symerons</hi> (a black People, who fled from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> their Maſters, by reaſon of their Cruelty, and ſince grown into two Kingdoms, the one to the Eaſt, the other to the Weſt of the way from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to <hi>Panama.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Captain ſet thoſe <hi>Negroes</hi> aſhore, that they might joyn themſelves to their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the <hi>Symerons,</hi> or at leaſt that he might prevent their going to alarm the Town with News of his Arrival, <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> being far diſtant from that place by land; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reſolved to go thither with all ſpeed and ſecrecy.</p>
            <p>And ſo diſpoſing of his Companies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they inclined, he left the three Ships and Carvel with Captain <hi>Rawſe,</hi> and choſe into his four Pinnaces, fifty three of our men, and twenty of Captain <hi>Rawſes,</hi> well armed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 28. Thus parted from our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we arrived at the Iſland of <hi>Cativaas,</hi> being twenty five Leagues diſtant, <hi>Aug.</hi> 2. where
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93865:7"/>
our Captain trained his men, delivering to each their ſeveral Arms, encouraging them with certain hopes of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The ſame day we ſailed for <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi> Before Sun-ſet we reached <hi>Rio Franciſco.</hi> Thence he led us hard aboard the ſhore (that we might not be deſcried) to within two Leagues of the Point of the Bay, where we rode till it was dark.</p>
            <p>When our Captain, finding thoſe of our Company propoſing difficulties, reſolved to take the opportunity that Night; and ſo we arrived there at three of the Clock after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. About the ſame time a Ship of <hi>Spain</hi> had arrived there, who ſuſpecting us, ſent her Gundeloe to alarm the Town, which our Captain perceiving, prevented, ſo that we landed without any difficulty, and ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſix Pieces of Ordnance, the Gunner ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fled, whereby the Town was alarm'd.</p>
            <p>Our Captain left twelve men to keep the Pinnaces, that we might ſafely retreat in caſe of danger, and ſecuring the Platform, he thought it beſt to view the Mount on Eaſt ſide the Town, fearing leſt there might be Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance planted there, whence we might be annoyed; but ſeeing no fear of Danger thence we returned to the City, where we parted; <hi>John Oxnam</hi> and 16 of his men going about behind the Kings Treaſure houſe, entred the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93865:7"/>
Eaſt end of the Market, and our Captain by the broad Street paſſed to the Market place with ſound of Drum and Trumpet. The Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes were equally divided betwixt them, and proved no leſs advantageous to our men than frightful to the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Yet the Inhabitants had put themſelves in Arms, and drew up their Companies in ſome order at the South-eaſt end of the Market place. And to make a ſhew of far greater numbers of ſhot, they had hung lines with Matches lighted athwart the Weſt end of the Market place, between the Church and the Croſs, but perceiving their Stratagem by us diſcovered, they fled.</p>
            <p>But the Soldiers preſented us with a volly of ſhot, levelling ſo low, that their Bullets oft times grazed the Sands: And we having once fired upon them, and feathered them with our Arrows (made on purpoſe) came to puſh of Pike, when our fire-Pikes did us great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, where our men ſome with their Pikes, and ſome with the butt-end of their Muskets ſo annoyed the Enemy, that they threw down their Arms to provide for their ſafety by flight.</p>
            <p>In the Chaſe ſeveral of our men were hurt with the Arms which the Enemies had let fall as they fled, which cauſed us to deſiſt the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite; ſo we returned to the midſt of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93865:8"/>
Our Captain having taken 2, or 3 <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> commanded them to ſhew the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours houſe where the Treaſure was kept. At our coming thither, the great door (where the Moyls uſually unlade) was open, a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle lighted on the top of the ſtairs, and a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net ready ſadled: By means of this light we ſaw a huge heap of Silver, being a pile of Bars about 70 foot in length, 10 in breadth, and 12 in heighth; but our Captain forbid any to touch it, but to ſtand on our Guard.</p>
            <p>There was in the Kings Treaſure near the Water-ſide, more Gold and Jewels than all our four Pinnaces could carry.</p>
            <p>When we were returned to our ſtrength, we were alarm'd with news, that our Pinnaces were in danger to be taken, and that if we got not quickly aboard, we would be overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Multitudes of Soldiers and Towns People. Our Captain therefore ſent his Brother and <hi>John Oxnam</hi> to ſearch out the Truth of it, who found our men in the Pinnaces much frighted, by reaſon of great Companies they ſaw running up and down, ſome with Matches lighted, ſome with other Weapons from the out-parts of the Town, who came often near us, and, firing, retreated.</p>
            <p>Preſently after there fell a mighty ſhower of Rain with Thunder and Lightning, ſo that before we could recover a ſhelter, ſome of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93865:8"/>
our Bow-ſtrings were wet, and ſome of our Match and Powder dammaged; which while we were refurniſhing, ſeveral of our men were muttering on the foreſaid Reports of the ſtrength of the Town; whereupon our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain told them, he had brought them to the Mouth of the Treaſure of the World, if they would want it, blame themſelves only; and therefore when the ſtorm was over, unwilling to give his men longer leiſure to demur, or the Enemy further reſpite, he ſtept forward, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Brother with <hi>John Oxnam</hi> and their Company to break the Kings Treaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, the reſt to follow himſelf to keep the ſtrength of the Market place, till they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd their Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But as he ſtept forward, he began to faint through much effuſion of Blood out of a wound in his Leg, he received in the firſt encounter, which though it ſmarted, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, till his fainting diſcovered it, the Blood having filled the prints our footſteps made, to the great diſmay of all our Company, thinking it incredible, that one man ſhould loſe ſo much Blood, and live.</p>
            <p>And therefore tho' they would have hazarded much for ſuch a Booty, yet would they not endanger their Captains life, but having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him ſome Cordial, and tied up his Leg, they entreated him to go aboard, that his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93865:9"/>
wound might be dreſt, and then return aſhore, if he thought fit.</p>
            <p>This, when they could not perſwade him to (as knowing, that if they went aboard, they could never recover that ſtate again, in which they now were, and thinking it more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to jeopard his life for ſo great a Prize, than to leave ſuch an Enterprize unaccompliſhed) they with force and entreaty carryed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board his Pinnace, abandoning a Rich Spoil to preſerve their Captains Life.</p>
            <p>Thus we embarkt, <hi>July</hi> 29 by break of day; many of our men beſides our Captain were wounded, only a Trumpeter ſlain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our Chirurgions were buſie in dreſſing their Wounds, but eſpecially our Captains. And before we departed the Harbour, we took the aforeſaid Ship of Wines belonging to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But before we had her free of the Haven, they of the Town ſhot at us. But notwithſtanding we carried our Prize to the Iſle <hi>Baſtimienſes,</hi> or the Iſle of <hi>Victuals,</hi> where we ſtaid two days to cure our wounded men, and refreſh our ſelves.</p>
            <p>At our arrival here, the Governour ſent to our Captain a Principal Soldier of the late ſent Garriſon, to view us, who at his coming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted he came of meer good Will, for that we had undertaken ſo great an attempt with ſo few men; and that at firſt they feared we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93865:9"/>
had been <hi>French,</hi> of whom they expected no mercy, but perceiving us to be <hi>Engliſh,</hi> their fears were the leſs, knowing, that tho' we took the Treaſure, yet we would uſe no Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty towards their perſons.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this fair pretence, his Governour had ſent him aboard, by reaſon divers of the Town had affirmed they knew our Captain, who had been often on their Coaſt laſt two years; he deſired to know, 1. Whether our Captain was the ſame Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Drake</hi> or no? 2. Whether our Arrows, which many of their men were wounded with, were poiſoned? And 3. how they might be cured? Laſtly, what Victuals or Neceſſaries we wanted, promiſing to ſupply us. Our Captain, though ſuſpecting him a Spie, yet anſwered his demands; That he was the ſame Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> that it was not his manner to poiſon Arrows, and that the Wounds might be cured by ordinary Chirurgery; as for Wants, he told him, He wanted nothing, but ſome of that ſpecial Commodity that Country yielded, and therefore before he departed he meant to reap ſome of their Harveſt they got out of the Earth.</p>
            <p>To this the Gentleman replied, What then was the Reaſon we departed the Town at this time, where there is above 360 Tun of Silver ready for the Fleet, and a greater
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93865:10"/>
value of Gold; but when our Captain had declared the cauſe, he acknowledged our wiſdom in departing, was no leſs than our courage in attempting.</p>
            <p>Thus with courteous entertainment, after Dinner, he was diſmiſſed in ſuch ſort that he proteſted he was never ſo much Honored in his life.</p>
            <p>After his departure, the <hi>Negroe</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned confirmed his report of Gold and Silver, and told us how we might acquire ſtore of it by means of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> whom though he had very much incenſed, yet if our Captain would undertake his Protection, he durſt hazard his life, as knowing our Captains name was moſt precious among them.</p>
            <p>Whereupon we further conſulted, and becauſe this place ſeemed not ſafe, next day we Sailed for <hi>Port-Plentie</hi> where we had left our Ships and recovered it next night.</p>
            <p>At our return to our Ships, Captain <hi>Rauſe</hi> doubting of our ſafe continuance upon that Coaſt, departed: our Captain in the mean time having put all things in readineſs reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with his 2 Ships and 3 Pinnaces to go to <hi>Carthagene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aug.</hi> 13 We came to an Anchor in 3 Fathom Water, between the Iſlands of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſha</hi> and St. <hi>Bernards.</hi> Our Captain led
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93865:10"/>
the Pinnaces about the Iſland into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of <hi>Carthagene;</hi> where he found a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate at Anchor, &amp; one man only aboard, who being askt for the reſt of his company, told they were gone aſhore that evening; that 2 hours before night there paſt by a Pinnace making all ſpeed they could, and askt him if any <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> had been there late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and upon Anſwer that none had been, they bid them look to themſelves: that after this Pinnace was come to the out-parts of <hi>Carthagene</hi> many great Pieces were ſhot off; whereupon one going to the Topmaſt eſpied over the Land diverſe Frigates bringing themſelves within the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>This report our Captain credited; and having further examined this old Mariner, he underſtood that there was within the next Point a great Ship of <hi>Sivel</hi> ready to Sail next morning for <hi>Domingo,</hi> and taking this old man into the Pinnace he rowed towards this Ship, which we boarded. As ſoon as we were on the Decks we threw down the Gates and Spare-decks to prevent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of cloſs Fight; and then we cut her Cables, and towed her with our three Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces without the Iſland, without danger of their great ſhot.</p>
            <p>Which when the Town heard of, they put themſelves into readineſs, and came
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93865:11"/>
down to the very point of the Wood, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
            <p>The next morning we took two Frigats, in which were two of the Kings <hi>Scrivano's</hi> with 7 Mariners and 2 <hi>Negroes,</hi> come from <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and bound for <hi>Carthagene,</hi> to certifie them of our aforementioned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit at <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi> Yet our Captain at the <hi>Scrivano's</hi> entreaties ſet all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a ſhore, and then bare up to the Iſland of St. <hi>Bernards,</hi> three Leagues off the Town.</p>
            <p>Our Captain now conſidering that he was diſcovered, found that he muſt wait ſome time before he could accompliſh his deſign, and likewiſe that his Pinnaces muſt be well mann'd; in order to which he had a deſign to burn one of the Ships and make the other a Storehouſe; but finding that his Company would be loth of that, he thought of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expedient; and therefore ſent for <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Moon</hi> (Carpenter in the <hi>Swan)</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to bore ſeveral holes in the Well of that Ship as near the Keel as he could, and that with all ſecreſie. He was very averſe from doing it, but having heard our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains reaſons, he was at laſt perſwaded, and did it accordingly.</p>
            <p>The next morning our Captain deſigned to go a Fiſhing, and going aboard the <hi>Swan</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:93865:11"/>
he deſired his Brother to go with him, who deſired him to ſtay alittle and he would immediately attend him. Our Captain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Carpenter had fulfilled his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, demanded of them why their Bark was ſo deep? Whereupon his Brother ſent one down to the Steward to know what was the matter; who going down immediately alarum'd them with news that the Ship was full of Water. Whereupon all hands were ſet to work, but all in vain; Our Captain conſulting with them about it, found, that deſpairing of ſaving her they referred to him what ſhould be done: And therefore he propoſed to them that he would go into the Pinnace till ſuch time as a Frigate were provided, and that his Brother ſhould be Captain in the Admiral, and the Maſter ſhould be alſo there with him inſtead of this; which ſeeing ſhe could not be ſaved he would have fired that the Enemy might not have her, but firſt that every one ſhould take out of her what they lacked or liked. This was put in execution that night, and ſo our Captain had his deſire, having now men enough for his Pinnaces.</p>
            <p>The next day we reſolved to ſeek out a fit place in the Sound of <hi>Dorienne</hi> where we might leave our Ship at Anchor undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the Enemy: that ſo the Enemy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93865:12"/>
imagining us departed we might better fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our purpoſes with our Pinnaces.</p>
            <p>And accordingly we departed for the ſaid Sound, and in 5 days reached it, where we ſtayed 15 days, keeping very cloſe, that our Enemies might think we were departed.</p>
            <p>Here we were not Idle, but beſides our trimming and fitting our Pinnaces, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us rid a Plat of Ground to build us Houſes for our Lodging, wherein the <hi>Negroe</hi> was ſerviceable to us. As alſo at ſpare times we had ſeveral ſorts of recreations as every man fancied.</p>
            <p>After the fifteen days expired, our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain leaving the Ship with his Brother took 2 Pinnaces for <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> and paſſing by <hi>Carthagene,</hi> when we were within 2 Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues of the River we Landed to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on the Main. Where ſeeing ſome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> they asked us what we would have? and knowing we deſired freſh Victuals they brought us ſome; for which courteſie our Captain ſufficiently rewarded them.</p>
            <p>Thence we departed to <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> where we entred at 3 in the Afternoon. From thence till night we rowed up the ſtream, making but ſmall progreſs. We moared our Pinnaces to a Tree that night, by reaſon of a huge ſhower of Rain with Terrible Claps of Thunder, (which is uſual there
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93865:12"/>
and continues about three quarters of an hour) after which it was very calm, and then we were infeſted with Flies called <hi>Mushitos</hi> (like our Gnats) which bite ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; our beſt remedy againſt them was Juice of Lemons.</p>
            <p>At Break of day we departed up the River; where we eſpied a Canow with 2 <hi>Indians</hi> fiſhing in the River, but we ſpoke not to them for being deſcried, nor they to us, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Afterwards we eſpied cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain houſes on the other ſide the River. And a <hi>Spaniard</hi> which kept thoſe houſes thinking us his Country men, made a Smoke, for a ſign to us to turn that way, but when we drew near him, he ſaw his miſtake, and ſo fled from his houſes, which were 5 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber full of white Rusk, Bacon with ſeveral other Proviſions, to ſerve the Fleet return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Spain. With ſtore of this we loaded our Pinnaces, and haſtned our departure, by reaſon of intelligence we had of certain <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> that the Frigats (30 in number which uſually tranſport Merchandiſe out of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Cartagena,</hi> &amp; thence to theſe houſes, and ſo in <hi>Canows</hi> up to <hi>Nueva Reyno,</hi> and return in Exchange, Gold Treaſure and Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that Kingdom) were not returned from <hi>Cartagena</hi> ſince the firſt report of our being there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:93865:13"/>
               <hi>Sep.</hi> 10. As we returned to our Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſent down the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Villa del Rey,</hi> with Bows and Arrows againſt us, but we rowed down the Stream, one League, and Anchored till the morning, then we got to the Mouth of the River, where we unladed our Proviſions, cleanſed our Pinnaces, and took it in again, and then went Weſtward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sep.</hi> 11. Between <hi>Cartagena</hi> and <hi>Tolou</hi> we took 5 or 6 Frigats laden with Victuals; we ſet the Men at liberty, having heard all we could of 'em, keeping only two of the Frigats well ſtored with Victuals.</p>
            <p>Three days after, we arrived at <hi>Port-plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> where we built 4 Store-houſes, to keep our Proviſion in, ſeveral Leagues aſunder, that if the Enemy ſhould ſurprize any one, we might be furniſhed by another, our <hi>Negroes</hi> being very uſeful to us in this Work.</p>
            <p>At this time Captain <hi>John Drake</hi> fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately found out the <hi>Symerons</hi> as he rowed aloaf the Shore, by the direction of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Negroe, Diego,</hi> who calling to the <hi>Symerons,</hi> dealt ſo effectually with them that he gave and received two men, as pledges of Fidelity, appointing a meeting next day at a River, midway, between the <hi>Cabezas</hi> and our Ships, called <hi>Rio Diego.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two being well qualified men, did
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93865:13"/>
with all reverence, declare to our Captain their great joy conceived by his arrival, as knowing him to be an Enemy to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and therefore were ready to aſſiſt him againſt their Enemies to the utmoſt: and that their captain did then ſtay at the mouth of <hi>Rio Diego</hi> to attend his pleaſure, and that they would have come by Land to this place, but that the way is very troubleſome, by reaſon of ſteep Mountains, deep Rivers and thick Brakes; deſiring therefore our Captain would take order about it: Our Captain weighing their Speech with former Intelligence, and comparing it with their great kindneſs towards his Brother; reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with his Brother and the two <hi>Symerons,</hi> in his two Pinnaces, to go towards the River, which he did that night; ordering the reſt of their company to follow them next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe there was a place of great ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The ſafety of it conſiſted not only that it was a fruitful Countrey, and that no <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were there, but eſpecially that it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth among a great many goodly Iſlands full of Trees, where, though there be Channels, yet there are ſuch Rocks and Shoals that no man can enter by night, nor by day without diſcovery: whereas our Ship might lye hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den within the Trees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sep.</hi> 14. The next day we met with them
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93865:14"/>
at the aforeſaid place, the reſt being at a miles diſtance. After we had entertained them, and received teſtimonies of their good will, we took 2 more of them into our Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, leaving our 2 men with them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a meeting with them and ſome more at the River <hi>Guana.</hi> So we departed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Ship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 16. Two days after we found her, being much damnified by tempeſt. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving repaired her, <hi>Sept.</hi> 18. Our Captain ſent a Pinnace towards the bottom of the Bay, to found out the Channel, for the bringing her in, and the next day got her ſafe into the beſt Channel; it was 5 miles diſtant from the <hi>Cativaas</hi> betwixt the Iſland and the Main, being very narrow, and full of buſhes. We had ſcarce ſetled there when our 2 men with the Troup of <hi>Symerons</hi> came in ſight of our Ship, whom we brought aboard.</p>
            <p>Our Captain deſiring they would put him in a way to procure Gold, they told him if they had known of it before, they could have given him ſtore of it (as having taken a great quantity from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> which they ſunk into the River) which now they could not do, becauſe the Rivers in which it was thrown were very high, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in theſe rainy months uſe not to carry their Treaſure
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93865:14"/>
by Land. This anſwer ſatisfied us of their honeſt meaning towards us. Therefore our Captain reſolved for theſe 5 months to ſtay a Shore, and ſo <hi>Sept.</hi> 24. we built houſes for our aboad that time, and a Fort Triangle wiſe, 13 foot high. But after 14 days repoſe here, our Captain purpoſing to go to <hi>Cartagena</hi> with 3 Pinnaces, left his Brother to govern thoſe left behind with the <hi>Symerons</hi> to finiſh the Fort begun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oct.</hi> 7. Thus we ſet Sail and came that night to an Iſland (which he called <hi>Spurkite,</hi> from great ſtore of Birds in that ſhape.) The next day we were clear of theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands, and about 4 days after, near the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland of St. <hi>Bernards</hi> we chaſed 2 Frigates aſhore, and recovering one of the Iſlands we ſtayed there 2 days to waſh our Pinnaces and catch Fiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oct.</hi> 16. Thence we went towards <hi>Tolou</hi> and landed in a Garden where certain <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> delivered us their Bows and Arrows and gave us ſuch fruit, as the place yielded, for which we requited them. Our Captains de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in taking thoſe places was to learn the true ſtate of the Country and the Fleets.</p>
            <p>Thence we went towards <hi>Chareſha</hi> the Iſland of <hi>Cartagena,</hi> where we let fall our Grappers betwixt the Iſland and the Main over againſt the goodly Garden Iſland. Our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93865:15"/>
Captain, would not ſuffer us to land there, knowing it would have proved dangerous; and within 3 hours after, paſſing by the Point of the Iſland, we had a volly of 100 ſhot from them; and yet but one of our men was hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oct.</hi> 17. This evening we departed to Sea, and the next morning we took a Bark, which we eaſily boarded, for that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with moſt of the Paſſengers had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore. She had in her great ſtore of Sope and Sweet-meats bound from St. <hi>Domingo</hi> to <hi>Cartagena. Oct.</hi> 18. The next day we ſet all the men aſhore (ſave a young <hi>Negroe</hi> we kept) but kept the Bark, and in her bare to the mouth of <hi>Cartagena</hi> Harbor, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored.</p>
            <p>That, Afternoon ſome Horſemen came down with the <hi>Scrivano</hi> aforementioned to the point, and held up a Truce Flag, deſiring ſafe conduct to our Ship; which granted the <hi>Scrivano</hi> came a board, and thanking our Captain for former courteſies, he promiſed that night to procure us ſtore of Victuals, whatever diſpleaſure he might incur thereby. But we found this only a device of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's to delay time till they were of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſtrength to entrap us; and therefore we put to Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oct.</hi> 20. The next day in the Afternoon we took 2 Frigates come from <hi>Cartagena,</hi> the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93865:15"/>
one of 50 the other of 12 Tuns, having only ballaſt in them; we kept the Frigats but ſet the men aſhore in the great Frigats Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delow.</p>
            <p>The next morning they came down to the Weſter Point with a Truce Flag; &amp; our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain manned one Pinnace and rowed aſhore; when we were near the ſhore the <hi>Spaniards</hi> fled into the Wood as afraid of us, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'twas only to draw us on; as we reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Land our Captain leaped aſhore in their ſight, but made no ſtay; when he was come aboard again, we haled off and rode a while; They came forth again, and ſent a youth to demand what was our intent to ſtay thus upon the Coaſt? Our Captain anſwered, for Traffick; he ſent him again to ſhew him that 'twas prohibit, to Traffick with Foreign People for any thing except Powder. He anſwered he was come to exchange his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities for Gold and Silver and was purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to effect it. However he gave this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger a Shirt for his reward.</p>
            <p>We heard no anſwer all that day but kept in our Frigats, keeping good watch all night. The next morning the wind turned Eaſterly, and we-ſaw two Sails (which were ſent from <hi>Cartagena</hi> to fight us) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us; whereupon our Captain went to encounter them, and approaching them we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93865:16"/>
ſaw many men aboard them. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the Shore thought to recover their Frigats (being left unmanned) while we were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied with the other. But our Captain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, for leaving <hi>John Oxnam</hi> to treat thoſe two Ships, he made ſpeed to his Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, and cauſed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> conſult to ſave their lives by flight, leaving ſeveral of their weapons behind them. And ſeeing he could not man them, he burnt the one and ſunk the other. This done he returned to <hi>John Oxnam</hi> (who all this while lay ſilent by the Men of War) and the wind blowing from Sea, we were forced to bear into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor before them, they ſuppoſing we fled; but as ſoon as we felt ſmooth Water, getting the wind, we fought them at advantage, ſo that they were willing to preſs no nigher: and as they let fall their Anchors, we drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ours in the wind of them. They ſeeing no gain to be had of us retired to the Town; but we by reaſon of bad weather Rode there 4 days.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 27. A Frigat came from Sea, and ſeeing us, ran her ſelf aſhore, unhanging her Rudder and throwing away her Sails; when we were come up to her, a party came down to the point of the Main, whom we by our ſhot cauſed quickly retire into the Woods. Whereupon we went to Sea with intent to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93865:16"/>
ride at the Rock called <hi>Las Serenas</hi> 2 Leagues off, but through tempeſt were forced to return into the Harbor. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had a new device; for they ſent forth a Party againſt us, who at our encountring them fled with intent to draw us after them, having an ambuſh ſet for us; beſides, 2 Pinnaces well mann'd came towards us and attacqued us boldly; and ſeeing us bear from them, they concluded of Victory: But our Captain Commanding his other Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to be brought a head of him, and to let fall their Grappers each a head the others, environed both the Pinnaces as for a cloſe fight. We (as well as they) ſpent Powder apace, but had but one of out men wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; what they had we knew not, but their Pinnaces were ſhot through in diverſe places and the Powder of one of them took fire; whereupon we bore towards them, which they ſeeing, betook themſelves to their old Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. Thus ſeeing little hopes off ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in this place, our Captain thought it beſt to go Eaſtward towards <hi>Rio Grand</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our ſelves with Victuals, being now ſcarce of them, and 2 days after we came to the Villages of ſtore, where before we had furniſhed our ſelves ſufficiently, but now found nothing, to our great grief; the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> having cauſed the People to fly to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93865:17"/>
Mountains, and driven away their Cattel that we might not be relieved; afterwards we ſaw a Frigate at Sea, and made quickly towards her, hoping to be relieved thence, but when we had boarded her we found ſhe had neither Meat, nor Money.</p>
            <p>Thus we endured ſcarcity for 7 or 8 days, bearing room for <hi>Santa Martha</hi> in hopes to find Shipping there, and finding none we Anchored under the Weſtern point; which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having notice of, conveyed 30 or 40 ſhot among the Clifts, which ſo annoyed us that we were forced to be gone with all ſpeed. Then we entred into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation what to do, the Company being for landing ſomewhere Eaſtward to get Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; But our Captain thought it better to bear towards <hi>Rio de Haca</hi> or <hi>Carizao.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Company of the other Pinnace an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that neither their Pinnaces could hold out, nor they themſelves ſubſiſt with ſo ſlender proviſion. He anſwered they had more than he had, and therefore doubted not but they would truſt providence. And ſo he hoyſed his fore-Sail and ſet for <hi>Carizao,</hi> which they perceiving followed him.</p>
            <p>As we had Sailed 3 Leagues we eſpied a Sail plying Weſtward, and ſo joyfully bare towards her; ſhe, being a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship above 90 Tun, ſhot her Ordinance at us. We durſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93865:17"/>
not attempt boarding her, it being Stormy, but attended her, and 2 hours after it being Calm, we boarded her, and furniſhed our ſelves ſufficiently with Proviſion.</p>
            <p>All things ſet in order, &amp; the Wind ariſing, we plyed off and on all night; when it was day the Captain ſent <hi>Edward Hixom</hi> to ſearch out a good Harbor, who having found one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and we came in with our new Prize: Our Captain promiſing liberty and all their Apparel to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> if they would procure us freſh Water and Victuals, which they did; and towards the evening we came all aboard again leaving, our late Priſoners, the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards</hi> aſhore according to our promiſe to their great joy, and ſo ſet Sail.</p>
            <p>At this time a ſickneſs raged among us, and <hi>Charles Club</hi> one of our Quarter-maſters died of it to our great grief: we impured it to cold, men had taken lying in the Pinnaces. But however it pleaſed God, that all the reſt of our Company recovered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nov.</hi> 15. Next morning our Captain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Minion,</hi> his leſſer Pinnace, to haſten before him toward his Ships at Fort <hi>Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> within the <hi>Cabeza</hi>'s, to acquaint them of his coming, and prepare all things for our Land Journey, if ſo be they heard any thing from the <hi>Symerons</hi> of the Fleets arrival.</p>
            <p>When we came to our Ship we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93865:18"/>
to our great Grief, with the news o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Death of <hi>John Drake</hi> our Captains Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and one <hi>Richard Allen,</hi> both ſlain in attempting to board a Frigate: The manne<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of Hides full of Pikes and Calivers which were diſcharged in their faces; of which there were ſeveral wounded, and <hi>John Drake</hi> and <hi>Richard Allen</hi> mortally; but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they got free of the Frigate and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Ship, where thoſe 2 died.</p>
            <p>Thus having moared our Ship our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reſolved to lie hid, expecting to hear of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, and therefore ſupplied his Company with the <hi>Symerons</hi> out of his aforeſaid Magazine, beſides wild Beaſts out of the Woods. After a Months Sail moſt of our men fell ſick of a <hi>Calenture,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93865:18"/>
died, of whom <hi>Joſeph Drake,</hi> another of our Captains Brothers, was one, whom for the diſcovering of the Nature of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, our Captain cauſed be opened by the Surgeon, who found his Liver ſwollen, his Heart as it were ſodden and his Guts all fair. Within 4 days the Surgeon that cut him up died alſo, by reaſon of an over ſtrong pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he had taken.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Symerons</hi> during our abſence ranged up and down the Country to learn what they could for us; now they bring us news that the Fleet was arrived at <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi> Our Captain ſent the <hi>Lyon</hi> to deſcrie the truth thereof; who eſpying a Frigate, boarded and took herladen with <hi>Maiz,</hi> Hens and Pompions from <hi>Tolou.</hi> The men therein, who aſſured us of their arrival, our Captain uſed very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, guarding them from the cruelty of the <hi>Symerons</hi> who were thirſting after their Blood.</p>
            <p>And when he prepared for his Journey to <hi>Panama,</hi> he gave <hi>Ellis Hixom</hi> charge of his Ship and Company, and eſpecially of thoſe <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things thus ordered, our Captain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with the <hi>Symerons</hi> about Proviſion for this Journey; they told him that great ſtore of Shoes were neceſſary, by reaſon of the many Rivers with Stones and Gravel they were to paſs. All things provided we took
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93865:19"/>
our Journey on <hi>Shrove Tueſday, Feb.</hi> 3. By this time 28 of our men had died, and a few healthy men were left aboard with <hi>Ellis,</hi> who had ſtrict charge not to truſt any Meſſenger that ſhould come in our Captains name without his handwriting.</p>
            <p>We were in all 48, 18 <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the reſt <hi>Symerons,</hi> who, beſides their Arrows bore our Proviſion and Victuals, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not carry enough, by the way they provided us ſtore with their Arrows.</p>
            <p>They have each 2 ſorts of Arrows; the one to defend himſelf, and offend the Enemy; the other to kill his Victuals. Theſe for fighting are ſomewhat like the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows only ſomewhat longer and headed with Iron, Wood or Fiſh-Bones. But the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for Proviſion are of 3 ſorts; the firſt ſerveth to kill any great Beaſt near hand, and hath an Iron head of a Pound and a half, ſhaped like the head of a Javelin, as ſharp, as a knife: The ſecond for leſſer Beaſts, and hath an head of three-quarters of a Pound. The third for all manner of Birds, and hath a head of an ounce weight. Theſe heads tho of Iron, yet kept their edge long. For theſe and ſuch uſes Iron is of more value here than Gold: and he that can temper it well is moſt eſteemed.</p>
            <p>Every day we marched at Sun Riſing,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93865:19"/>
continuing till 10 in the Forenoon, then reſting (near ſome River) till paſt 12, we marched till 4 a clock at night, when we repoſed our ſelves in ſome convenient place.</p>
            <p>When we came to the place we intended to lodge at, the <hi>Symerons</hi> laid aſide their Burthens, to cut down Poles and <hi>Palmito</hi> Boughs or <hi>Plantain</hi> leaves, and with ſpeed ſet up ſix Houſes; firſt faſtning 3 or 4 great Poſts with Forks, deep into the ground, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them they laid one Tranſome (about 20 foot) making the ſides like the roofs of our Country Houſes, Thatching it cloſe with the aforeſaid Leaves, ſo that it would keep out rain a long time.</p>
            <p>We found near the Rivers ſeveral Fruits, as <hi>Mammeas, Guyavas, Palmitos, Pinos, Oranges, Limons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>3d.</hi> day of our Journey they brought us to a Town of their own, ſituate upon the ſide of a Hill near a River, encompaſſed with a Dike 8 foot broad, and a thick mud Wall 10 foot high. It had one long and broad Street from Eaſt to Weſt, and two croſs Streets narrower; there were in it fifty or ſixty houſeholds, which were ſo cleanly, (that not only the Houſes, but Streets were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. Their Apparel is ſomewhat after the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> faſhion. This Town is diſtant from <hi>Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre de Dios</hi> 35 Leagues, and 45 from <hi>Panama,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:93865:20"/>
it is ſufficiently ſtored with Beaſts, Fowls and ſeveral Fruits.</p>
            <p>As for their Religion, they have no kind of Prieſts, only they hold the Croſs in great reputation: but at our Captains perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they were contented to leave their Croſſes and learn the Lords Prayer, and be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome meaſure in Gods True Worſhip. They keep a continual watch in 4 parts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 3 miles of the Town, for fear of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who ſometimes by the Conduct of ſome <hi>Symerons,</hi> Captives to them, have come in upon them.</p>
            <p>We ſtayed there all night, during which time they related unto us ſeveral Broils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> particularly one: A Gentleman entertained by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Country undertook laſt year, with 150 Souldiers to put them, Young, and Old to the Sword, being conducted by one of them that had been taken Priſoner; he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized it half an hour before day, whereby many of the Men eſcaped, but many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children were killed: but the ſame morning by Sun riſing (their guide being ſlain) the <hi>Symerons</hi> aſſembled themſelves and behaved in ſuch ſort, that they drove the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> to ſuch extremity, that partly by the diſadvantage of the Woods, having loſt their guide, and partly by famine, not above 30
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93865:20"/>
of them returned. Their King dwelt in a City 16 Leagues South-eaſt of <hi>Panama,</hi> wherein are ſuppoſed to be 1700 fighting Men.</p>
            <p>Our Captain was kindly entreated by them all, and was deſired to abide with them ſome time, but he being intent on his Journey, thankt them for their kindneſs, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in his intended Journey.</p>
            <p>The order of our March was thus; Four of the <hi>Symerons</hi> as knew the way beſt went a mile before us, breaking off Boughs of Trees and throwing them on the way for a direction to thoſe that followed, 12 of them were our Vantguard, and 12 our Rereward, we in the middle.</p>
            <p>Our way through Woods by reaſon of the ſhade was cooler than it is in moſt parts in <hi>England,</hi> in the Summer time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 11. We came to a High Hill, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way where was a great Tree whence we might ſee both the North and South <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Ocean; one of the <hi>Symerons</hi> took our Captain by the hand and led him up thither who likewiſe called us up to it. The Tree was cut, and ſeveral ſteps made in it to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend; near unto the top was made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Bower, wherein 10 or 12 Men might eaſily ſit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:93865:21"/>
Being throughly ſatisfied with the ſight, we deſcended, and continued our former Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; when we came to the Champion Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try we found the Graſs of an extraordinary height. The Inhabitants are forced to burn it thrice a year that their Cattel may feed on it; after which it ſprings up freſh in 3 days; Its ſtalks are as big as a Wheaten reed, and though Cattle feed on it, yet in a few days it grows ſo high that they cannot reach it.</p>
            <p>After we were come within a days Journey of <hi>Panama,</hi> for fear of being diſcovered, we went out of the ordinary way, and came to a Grove within a League of <hi>Panama;</hi> thence we ſent a <hi>Symeron</hi> who had been formerly at <hi>Panama,</hi> in habit of a <hi>Negroe,</hi> to learn on what night (for they travel from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> by night, by reaſon they have no ſhades there, but from thence to <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> by day, for that the Country there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in Woods) they were to carry their Treaſure to <hi>Nombre de Dios;</hi> who returning certified us that the Treaſurer of <hi>Lima</hi> was to go that night with 8 Moyles laden with Gold, and one with Jewels. And further, that there were 2 <hi>Recoes,</hi> 50 Moyles in each, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den moſtly with Victuals, with ſome little quantity of Silver, to come forth that night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other. Hereupon we marched till we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93865:21"/>
came within 2 Leagues of <hi>Venta Cruz;</hi> two of our <hi>Symerons</hi> ſent before, found a <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> whom they brought to us; who exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining him were confirmed of the truth of that our Spy had told us. This Souldier having learned who our Captain was, prayed him to preſerve him from the fury of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and that ſeeing he was a Souldier, and aſſured him of more Gold that night than they could diſpoſe of, beſides Jewels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he would pleaſe to let him have ſo much as might ſuffice him and his Miſtreſs to live upon.</p>
            <p>Being at the place appointed, our Captain with half his men lay on one ſide of the way about 50 paces off in the long Graſs; <hi>John Oxnam</hi> with the Captain of the <hi>Symerons</hi> and other half on the other ſide of the way, the like diſtance; but ſo far diſtant that by that time the one Company could ſeize on the foremoſt Moyles, the other might take the hindmoſt, and likeways that if we ſhould have any Skirmiſh that night, we might not endamage our own men. We had not lain thus, much above an hour, when we heard the <hi>Recoes</hi> coming, and going betwixt <hi>Panama</hi> and <hi>Venta Cruz.</hi> And though ſtrict charge was given that none of our men ſhould ſtir as any paſſed from <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had nothing but Merchandiſe; yet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93865:22"/>
               <hi>Robert Pike,</hi> one of our men forgot himſelf and entiſing a <hi>Symeron</hi> with him, went hard by the way ſide, and a Cavalier from <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> coming by, ſtood up to ſee what he was, and though the <hi>Symeron</hi> pull'd him down again, yet the Gentleman took notice of him, ſeeing one all in White, (for we had put our ſhirts over our Cloaths that if we ſhould happen to Skirmiſh with them we might know our own men in the night) and preſently put ſpurs to his Horſe. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of his Horſes pace was obſerved by our Captain, who therefore ſuſpected we were diſcovered, but could not imagine by whoſe fault. Yet ſuppoſing it might be by reaſon of the danger of the Place, we lay ſtill in expectation of their coming, who by this time were within half a League of us, and had come, but that this Gentleman meeting them reported what he had ſeen, and perſuaded the Treaſurer it was either Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> or ſome from him, who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been fruſtrate of their hopes of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> were reſolved to have it here, and thereupon he prevailed with him to turn his <hi>Recoe</hi> out of the way, and to let the other <hi>Recoes</hi> which were laded moſtly with Victuals to paſs on, in regard the loſs of them would not be conſiderable. Thus were we diſappointed of a moſt rich booty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93865:22"/>
The other two <hi>Recoes</hi> coming up we ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon them. One of their chief Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers told our Captain how we were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and withal adviſed us to ſhift for our ſelves betimes. Whereupon <hi>Pedro,</hi> the Chief of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> told us that there were but two ways for eſcape, either to Travel back the ſame ſecret way we came, for four Leagues, into the Woods; or elſe to make a way through <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> by our Swords; The latter of which notwithſtanding the dangerouſneſs of it, our Captain choſe, as being the ſhorteſt way. Therefore command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to refreſh themſelves, he told them his reſolution, asking <hi>Pedro</hi> if he would give him his hand, not to forſake him, which he willingly did, vowing that he would rather dye at his Feet than leave him to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Fury, if he held this courſe. Thus we took our Journey to <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> with help of the Moyls, till we came within a Mile of the Town, where we turned away the <hi>Recoes,</hi> charging their Conductors not to follow us. There the way is cut through the Wood, ſo as two <hi>Recoes</hi> may paſs by one another. For thoſe Woods grow as thick as our thickeſt Hedges in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Company of Soldiers came out againſt us to the middle of this Wood, with whom a Convent of Fryers joyned; Our Captain
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93865:23"/>
informed of their coming, by two <hi>Symerons</hi> ſent before, gave charge that none of us ſhould ſhoot till the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had firſt Fired. When they came up, their Captain charged ours to yield our ſelves Priſoners, which our Captain refuſing, they immediately Fired, doing us no conſiderable hurt, ſave only <hi>John Harris</hi> one of our Company was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But our Captain perceiving their Shot ſlacking, gave us a Sign to diſcharge upon them, and then march or wards with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to cloſe with them. They retired to a place of greater ſtrength, and we haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our pace to prevent it. Which the <hi>Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> perceiving (though frighted with the Shot they had ſtept aſide) ruſhed forwards with their Arrows ready in their Bows, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dancing, and ſinging <hi>Yó pehó, yó pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hó,</hi> and ſo continued till we overtook ſome of the Enemy, who conveyed themſelves within the Woods to have taken their ſtand at us. But our <hi>Symerons</hi> brake in through the thickeſt of them, forcing them to flye; diverſe of our men were Wounded and one <hi>Symeron</hi> killed, who yet revenged his own death before he died.</p>
            <p>Thus we entred the Town, being about 40 or 50 Houſes, having both a Governor and other Officers, and ſome fair Houſes, with ſome Store-houſes, beſides he Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:93865:23"/>
We found here 3 Gentlewomen lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of Children who were come hither from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to bring forth their Children; becauſe it hath been obſerved that no <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or White, could ever be delivered at <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren died within 3 days; yet being brought up here or in <hi>Panama</hi> 5 or 6 years, and then brought to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> if they eſcap't ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſix weeks they lived as healthy as any where. Theſe Gentlewomen at our firſt coming were in great fear, yet, our Captain having charged the <hi>Symerons</hi> to hurt none ſave thoſe that were Armed, they received no harm. Having ſet our Guards on all paſſages to prevent danger, we ſtayed in this Town an hour and a half refreſhing our ſelves, and our Company and the <hi>Symerons</hi> had got ſome Pillage. A little before we departed 12 Horſemen come from <hi>Panama,</hi> ſuppoſing we had been gone, entred the Town, but were forced quickly to retire.</p>
            <p>Thus having diſpatcht our buſineſs in this Town we marched over the Bridge, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſame order as formerly, and our Captain longing to be at his Ships haſtned his Journey as much as poſſible, by reaſon whereof we marched with hungry Stomachs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:93865:24"/>
In our abſence the <hi>Symerons</hi> we left with our men had built a little Town 3 Leagues off where our Ship lay, where our Captain at their entreaty made ſome ſtay, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied us with Shoes, which had been wore out in our Journey.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Symerons</hi> were very ſerviceable to us, being to us guides, Intelligencers, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when any of our men was wearied, two of them would take him up and carry him 2 miles together, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhewed themſelves very Valiant.</p>
            <p>At our firſt entrance into this Town our Captain diſpatcht a <hi>Symeron</hi> with an order and token to the Maſter of our Ship, who being come was quickly ſet aboard; and ſhewing a Tooth-Pike of Gold, which he ſaid our Captain had ſent for a token to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hixom</hi> with charge to meet him at ſuch a River, tho the Maſter knew it was the Captains, yet by reaſon of his former order he demurred, which the <hi>Symeron</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, told him, that becauſe it was night when he was ſent, our Captain could not ſend a Letter, but with the point of his Knife wrote upon the Tooth-Pike; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Maſter looking upon it, read it, and being confirmed of the truth of it, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red accordingly, and repaired to the mouth of the River of <hi>Tortugos,</hi> where we met to our
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93865:24"/>
mutual rejoycing. We ſeemed to thoſe who had been at reſt aboard, ſtrangely meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed, which might probably be through our long Faſting and Travel, but our inward grief for being fruſtrate of our deſign, was no doubt the main cauſe.</p>
            <p>Thus returned from <hi>Panama,</hi> our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain purpoſing further to attempt the ſame Journey, he would not ſuffer the edge of his men to be rebated. And therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a deſign to attempt in ſome other places, and particularly <hi>Veragua,</hi> a rich Town lying between <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and <hi>Nicaragua</hi> where is the Richeſt Mine of Gold on this North ſide, he asked his Company their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Some thought it beſt to procure more Victuals, that we might keep cloſe till a convenient time, which might eaſily be done, ſeeing the Victual Frigates were not well Defended, whereas the Treaſure Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats were well Manned. Others were for intercepting Frigats laden with Treaſure, both becauſe we had ſtore of Victuals, and that they might be had at any time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Treaſure was only to be found when the Fleet is there, which was now. The <hi>Symerons</hi> being askt their opinion, declared that near <hi>Veragua Sinnior Pezoro</hi> (their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, from whom they had fled) had dwelt in a ſtrong Store houſe, above 19
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93865:25"/>
years, who ſeldom went abroad; and that he keeps 100 Slaves in the Mines (each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to bring in daily of gain 3 <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoes</hi> of Gold for himſelf, and two for his Women (8 s. 3 d. the <hi>Pezoe)</hi> whereby he had gathered a vaſt Treaſure, being cruel and covetous, and never went abroad with 5 or 6 men in his Guard, although he was always in fear. And that if our Captain were ſo reſolved they would ſo conduct him thither as he ſhould not be deſcried, but might ſurprize them, and that although his Houſe were very ſtrong yet they could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procure him acceſs to his Treaſure.</p>
            <p>Our Captain having heard all their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, concluded to reconcile the 2 firſt opinions, and therefore ſent <hi>John Oxnam</hi> Eaſtwards to provide for Victuals, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reſolving to go Weſtwards in the <hi>Minion,</hi> to lye off and on the <hi>Cabezas</hi> to attend the Frigats that tranſported the Treaſure: But diſliked the <hi>Symerons</hi> propoſal, leſt our men might thereby be wearied, whom he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtrengthen for his next ſervice.</p>
            <p>Therefore he diſmiſſed ſuch of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons</hi> as were deſirous to go, with ſuch gifts as were moſt pleaſing, entertaining ſtill aboard thoſe that were willing to ſtay, and ſo they ſteered their courſe as is ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:93865:25"/>
The <hi>Minion</hi> about the <hi>Cabexas</hi> met with a Frigate of <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> in which was ſome Gold, having a <hi>Genoway</hi> Pilot, who being ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy uſed, certified our Captain of the ſtate of the Town, and Harbor, and of a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate wherein was a Million of Gold, ready to depart in a few days, offering to conduct him to it, if he would do him his right, for that he know the Channel ſo well that he could enter ſafely by night, and utterly undeſcried, and that becauſe the way by Land from the point is far and difficult, and by Sea but 5 Leagues, though we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, we might diſpatch our buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Town could have notice. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe told he heard of <hi>Drakes</hi> being on the Coaſt, whereby they were greatly afraid, but had not as yet provided themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
            <p>Our Captain hearing this, had a mind to return to his Ship, to have been better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the place by ſome <hi>Symerons</hi> there; But the <hi>Genoway</hi> urged to loſe no time, promiſing ſucceſs if we delayed not, and therefore our Captain following his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſet in for to enter the Harbor.</p>
            <p>But when we came to the mouth of it, we heard a report of 2 Chambers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a League off, 2 Anſwering them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our <hi>Genoway</hi> ſuſpected we were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93865:26"/>
aſſuring us that this order was taken ſince his departure.</p>
            <p>But not only this, but providence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe croſſed our deſigns. For the wind that formerly was Eaſterly turned to the Weſt; whereupon we returned to our Ship, where on <hi>Sheer Thurſday</hi> we met according to appointment with our <hi>Bear,</hi> who had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his time better than we, having taken a Frigate wherein were 10 men, great ſtore of <hi>Maiz,</hi> 28 fat Hogs, and 200 Hens. Our Captain unladed her and made her up for a Man of War, having heard by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they were building 2 little Gallies in <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to waft the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro</hi> Fleet to and fro, but not yet lanched, Wherefore he purpoſed to take that Fleet, and, to encourage his Company, feaſted them ſumptuouſly that <hi>Eaſterday</hi> being <hi>Mar.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>The next day with this new Frigat and <hi>Bear</hi> we ſet for <hi>Cativaas,</hi> and landed 2 days after, ſtaying till noon, when ſeeing a Sail to the Weſtward, we plyed towards her, and ſhe bare with us till they ſaw we were no <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and their Catain ſuppoſing us thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> men he had heard of he made towards us.</p>
            <p>He was a <hi>French</hi> Captain of <hi>New-Haven</hi> and being diſtreſt he prayed our Captain to help him to ſome Water, for that he had
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93865:26"/>
nothing but Wine and Sider aboard, which had greatly empaired the health of his men. Our Captain ſent him ſome relief for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, willing him to follow us to the next Port where he ſhould be better ſupplyed. He ſent our Captain a Caſe of Piſtols and a guilt Symeter (which had been the late K. of <hi>France</hi>'s whom <hi>Monſ. Mongomery</hi> hurt in the Eye, and was given him by Mr. <hi>Stroffe)</hi> and our Captain requited him with a Chain of Gold, and a Tablet.</p>
            <p>This Captain reported to us the firſt news of the Maſſacre in <hi>Paris</hi> at the K. of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varres</hi> Marriage on St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> Day laſt, of the Admiral of <hi>France</hi> ſlain in his Chamber, and divers others of the Popiſh Cruelties. He told what famous reports he had heard of us; and he deſired to know of our Captain what way he might compaſs his Voyage. Tho' our Captain was jealous of him, yet upon conſultation he reſolved to take him and divide his men and put them with ours proportionably, ſo as we needed not fear much hurt of them, ſo that we might both gratifie them and ſerve our own turn. Having thus agreed with him we ſent for the <hi>Symerons;</hi> two of them were brought aboard our Ship, to give the <hi>French</hi> aſſurance of this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:93865:27"/>
As ſoon as we had furniſht our ſelves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſht the <hi>French,</hi> which was done in five or ſix days, taking twenty of the <hi>French</hi> and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of ours, with our <hi>Symerons,</hi> and leaving both our Ships in ſafe Road, we man'd our Frigat and two Pinnaces, and went toward <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> and becauſe it had not Water enough for our Frigat we left her at the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezas,</hi> man'd with <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> to <hi>Robert Doble,</hi> to ſtay there till our Pinnaces return'd; and then bare to <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> where our Captains landed, and ordered them, that had the Charge of the Pinnaces, to be there the fourth day following.</p>
            <p>And thus knowing that the Carriages went now daily from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> we went ſecretly through the Woods, towards the High-way, betwixt them; it is reckoned five Leagues by Sea but the way we went was ſeven. When we were come within an Engliſh Mile of the way, we paſt the night in great ſilence, in a convenient place, where we heard the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters working in their Ships, as they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do by reaſon of the heat of the day there. The next morning upon hearing the great number of Bells, the <hi>Symerons</hi> rejoyced, as having that opportunity again, of which we were diſappointed before; now they aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us we ſhould have more Gold than we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93865:27"/>
could bear away, as in truth it fell out: For there came three <hi>Recoes,</hi> one of fifty Moyls; the other two of ſeventy each, which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all near thirty Tun of Silver. We put our ſelves in readineſs, and went down near the way, where we ſtayed not long till we ſaw them, and took ſuch hold on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and hindermoſt Moyls, that all the reſt ſtayed and unladed, as their manner is.</p>
            <p>They were guarded with about forty five Soldiers, which occaſioned ſome ſmall Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, in which Conflict the <hi>French</hi> Captain was dangerouſly wounded, and one <hi>Symeron;</hi> but in the end we put them to flight, and then we unladed the Moyls. And being weary we were content to take a little with us as we could eaſily carry, hiding the reſt in convenient places.</p>
            <p>But when we had diſpoſed of all our matters (being about two hours) and were ready to march back, we heard both Horſe and Foot coming, as it ſeemed to the Moyls, for they did not follow us, after we entred the Woods; and the <hi>French</hi> Captain diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by reaſon of his Wounds ſtayed, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereby to recover his ſtrength. But after we had marched two Leagues, the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers complaining that they wanted one of their Men alſo; and it was found upon examination that he had drunk
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93865:28"/>
too much Wine, and over-lading himſelf with Pillage, and haſting to go before us, loſt himſelf in the Woods; and, as we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards knew, he was taken by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> that night, and upon Torture ſhewed them where we hid our Treaſure.</p>
            <p>We marched all that day and the next, to <hi>Rio Franciſco</hi> to meet our Pinnaces; but when we came thither we ſaw ſeven <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pinnaces. Whereupon we were afraid that they had taken or ſpoiled ours, our Captain having given them ſtrict charge to repair thither. But the night before there having fallen much Rain, and the Wind contrary and boyſterous, our Pinnaces could not come thither, whereby they were preſerved from the danger of falling into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands, who had been ſent on purpoſe to take our Pinnaces, upon their hearing that we intercepted the Treaſure; our Captain fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt having taken our Pinnaces they had forced our Men by Torture to confeſs where his Frigat and Ships were; yet he comforted us when we were fearing the worſt, &amp; ſaid to us; <hi>It is no time now to fear, but rather to haſt to prevent that which is feared: And ſuppoſe the Enemy to have taken our Frigats, yet it would require time to examine Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to execute their reſolution, before which time we might get to our Ships, tho</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93865:28"/>
               <hi>not by Land, yet by Water. Let us therefore make a Raft with Trees that are happily brought down the River this laſt Storm, and put our ſelves to Sea; I will be one, who will be the other? John Smith</hi> offered himſelf, and two <hi>Frenchmen</hi> that could ſwim well, and a <hi>Symeron,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Pedro</hi> (who was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind becauſe he could not Row.) The Raft was fitted and a Sail of Bisket. Sack prepared; An Oar was ſhaped out of a young Tree to ſerve for a Rudder. Our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at his departure promiſed, that if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God he got ſafe aboard his Frigat, he would in deſpite of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> get them all aboard. Thus they ſailed three Leagues ſitting continually up to the Waſte in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and at every Surge of the Waves to the Armpits, whereby their Skins were much fretted. At laſt they ſee the two Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, to our Captains great joy, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, chearfully declared to the reſt, that they were our Pinnaces, and that all was ſafe. But the Pinnaces not ſeeing the Raft, nor ſuſpecting any ſuch matter, and Night and Wind growing on, were forced to turn into a Cover behind the Point to ſtay that night. Which our Captain ſeeing put his Rafter a ſhore, and ran by Land about the Point, where he found there, who upon ſight of him made as much haſt to have him A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93865:29"/>
as being afraid he was chaſed by the Enemy, ſeeing him thus running, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ſo few. But when he was got Aboard he rid them of their doubts, ſhewing them a Quoit of Gold, thanking God that our Voyage was made. And he told the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> that their Captain, with two of his Men, were left behind, ſore wounded, but it ſhould be no diſadvantage to them.</p>
            <p>That night our Captain Rowed to <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> where he took in the reſt with the Treaſure; and by dawning of the Day ſailed back to our Frigat, and from thence to our Ship, and then divided the Gold and Silver equally betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About a fortnight after, having taken all neceſſaries out of our Ship, into our Frigat, and given her to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all this time, we ſet out with the <hi>French</hi> Ship, Riding ſome days by the <hi>Cabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zas.</hi> In the mean time our Captain ſ<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2+ letters">

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:93865:29"/>
now coming towards our Pinnace, he told us that within half an hour after our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the <hi>Spaniards</hi> overtook them, and took his Captain, and his companion; but that he eſcaped by reaſon he caſt away all his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and that thereby he made himſelf fit for flight. As for our Silver we hid, he thought it was all carryed away, for near 2000 <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Negroes</hi> were digging up all the ground thereabout for it. Notwithſtanding this, our Men went to the place, and for all the narrow ſearch that was made, brought back to our Frigate 13 Bars of Silver, and ſome Quoits of Gold. Now we purpoſed to go homewards, and our Captain in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto deſigned to look for a ſufficient Ship to carry ſo much Victuals as might ſerve for our Voyage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French-men</hi> having formerly gone from us, met with us again, and were very loth to leave us, but accompanied us to St. <hi>Bernards,</hi> and would further; but that we heard the Fleet was ready to Sail for <hi>Spain,</hi> riding near <hi>Cartagena.</hi> Thus we departed from them paſſing by <hi>Cartagena</hi> in fight of all the Fleet, with a Flag of St. <hi>George</hi> in the Main Top of our Frigate, with Silk Streamers and Ancients down to the Water, Sailing forwards till night, when we lay off
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93865:30"/>
and on, bearing ſmall Sail. About Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night we took a Frigate come from <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> of 25 Tuns, laden with Maiz, Hens, and Hogs, with ſome Honey, (which was then very uſeful, as reviving our crazed People.) The next morning we ſet the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners aſhore, and without ſtop Sailed to the <hi>Cabezas,</hi> where we hove all our lading aſhore, and brought our Frigats on the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> and new tallowed them.</p>
            <p>Being ready to depart we burnt our Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, that the <hi>Symerons</hi> might have the Iron work; and our Captain deſired <hi>Pedro</hi> with ſome others of them, to take what they had a mind to in the Ship, promiſing to with-hold nothing from them, without which we could ſubſiſt in our Voyage, and that he would look out ſome Silks and Linnen for their Wives; which while he was chooſing out of his Trunks, <hi>Pedro</hi> eſpyed the <hi>Cymeter</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Captain had given him, and had a great mind to it, and being loth to ask our Captain for it himſelf, he deſired another to do it for him, promiſing him a Quoit of Gold for his pains, and that he would give our Captain 4 other great Quoits. Our Captain being accordingly moved for it, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with it, yet willing to gratifie him that had deſerved ſo well, gave it him. He was exceedingly rejoyced hereat, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93865:30"/>
that he would preſent his King with it, who he knew would make him a great man for it, and in requital he deſired our Captain to accept four pieces of Gold. Our Captain received it in moſt kind ſort, but put it not to his own private uſe, but cauſed it to be caſt to the whole adventure, ſaying that it was reaſon that they which bare part of his burthen in ſetting him to Sea, ſhould ſhare in the profit.</p>
            <p>Thus we took our leave of that People ſetting over to the Iſlands of—, and thence towards <hi>Cape</hi> St. <hi>Anthony;</hi> but being to ſtand for the <hi>Havana</hi> we plyed to the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſeveral days, at which time, we took a ſmall Bark in which were 200 Hides, and a Pump which we ſet in our Frigat. The Bark, as not uſeful for us, we gave them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and afterwards came to <hi>Cape</hi> St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> where we refreſhed our ſelves, and took 250 Turtles by night, which we powdered and dried for our uſe.</p>
            <p>There were at this time belonging to the ſeveral Plantations of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> above Two Hundred Frigates ſome of 120, ſome of 12, but moſt of 30 or 40 Tuns, moſt of which during our abode in thoſe parts we took, and ſome of them twice or thrice, and yet never burnt or ſunk any of them unleſs Men of War ſent againſt

Winter;</hi> the <hi>Marigold,</hi> a Bark of 30 Tuns, Captain <hi>Jo. Thomas;</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> a Fliboat
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93865:32"/>
of 50 Tuns. Captain <hi>Jo. Cheſter;</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> a Pinnace of 15 Tuns.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ships he Mann'd with 164 able Men, and furniſhed them with all neceſſaries, not forgetting ornaments and delights, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with him ſeveral expert Muſicians; he likewiſe made ſome Pinnaces, but carried aboard in pieces for to be ſet up when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerved. Thus furniſhed, we ſet Sail from <hi>Plimouth, Nov.</hi> 15. 1557. at 5 a Clock in the Afternoon; but meeting with contrary Wind we were forced to put in at <hi>Falmouth.</hi> The next day there aroſe ſuch a Storm, that the Admiral and <hi>Marigold</hi> were fain to cut their main Maſt: And therefore when the Storm was over we returned to <hi>Plimouth</hi> to repair our damages; which done we put to Sea again, <hi>Dec.</hi> 13. When we were out of ſight of Land we eaſily conjectured whither our General intended, by his courſe, and his appointing <hi>Mogadore</hi> our place of meeting if any of our Ships ſhould be parted from the Fleet. The firſt Land we had ſight of, was <hi>Cape Cantine</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> on <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> in the Morning. The ſhore is White ſand, the In-land mountainous, in 32 deg. 30 min. North lat. Coaſting from hence 18 Leagues Southward, we arrived at the Iſland <hi>Moga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> before named. It is under the King of <hi>Feſs,</hi> in 31 deg. 40 min. a mile off the ſhore
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93865:32"/>
making a good Harbor between the Land and it. It is uninhabited, but a League in Circumference, overgrown with ſhrubs not unlike our Privet, full of Doves, and much frequented by ravenous Birds. At the South ſide of it are 3 hollow Rocks, under which are ſtore of wholeſom, but ugly Fiſh. We ſent a Boat to ſound the Harbor, and finding it ſafe, we brought in our Ships, <hi>Dec.</hi> 27. and continued there till the end of the Month, ſetting up one of our Pinnaces. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants perceiving us, gave us ſigns of their deſire to be brought aboard, to whom our General ſent a Boat, in which two of the <hi>Moors</hi> were received, one of ours being left aſhore as a Pledge.</p>
            <p>We entertained them very courteouſly that they might thereby underſtand that we came in peace, offering to traffick for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try commodities. To this they agreed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, to bring ſuch things as they had to exchange for ours. It is a Law among them to drink no Wine, notwithſtanding privately they taſte it liberally, as we found. At their return they reſtored our Pledge. The next day they brought with them Camels in ſhew loaden with Wares; and therefore according to order (our General being then aſhore in the Iſland) we ſhut off a Boat. Our Boat being come to Land, <hi>John Fry</hi> one of our men
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93865:33"/>
miſtruſting no danger, ſtept out of the Boat, but was preſently laid hold of, and carried away. The cauſe of this was a deſire the K. had to know whence our Fleet was; whether it were a forerunner of the K. of <hi>Portugals;</hi> but he having declared who we were, was immediately ſent back with a preſent to his Captain. But in the mean time our Captain reſenting it, landed his Company, and marched into the Country without reſiſtance; wherefore having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſome Wood, and viewed an old Fort built by the K. of <hi>Portugal,</hi> now ruined by this K. we departed, <hi>Dec.</hi> 13. for <hi>Cape Blank,</hi> ſo that when <hi>Fry</hi> return'd we were gone, yet the K. ſent him home to <hi>England</hi> in an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Merchant.</p>
            <p>Till <hi>Jan. 4th.</hi> we had Foul weather; yet we reached <hi>Cape de Guerre,</hi> where we took 3 <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fiſhermen, and carried with us to <hi>Rio del Oro</hi> under the Trop. of <hi>Cancer</hi> where we took a Carvel; from thence we Sailed to Cape <hi>Barbas,</hi> and took another Carvel, and <hi>Jan.</hi> 16. to <hi>Blank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Cape</hi> lyeth in 20 deg. 30 min. on the North ſide reſembling the Corner of a Wall; the Land betwixt it and <hi>Barbas</hi> is low and Sandy. Here we obſerve the South <hi>Guards</hi> (called the <hi>Croſiers)</hi> 9 d 30 m. above the <hi>Horizon.</hi> We took a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93865:33"/>
here; all her men having fled ſave two, and carried her with the reſt into the Harbor 3 Leagues within the <hi>Cape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, being a plentiful place, our General purpoſed to ſtay a while to refreſh his men. During our aboad he was viſited by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Country, who brought down a Woman a <hi>Moor,</hi> with an Infant hanging by her dry dug, having ſcarce life in her, to be ſold as a Cow and Calf, but our General would not deal in ſuch goods. They alſo brought Ambergreece and Gums to exchange for Water, of which they are very ſcarce; our General gave them Water, but would take nothing for it, as alſo ſome of our Victuals; their manner of eating whereof was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human.</p>
            <p>Having trimmed our Ships and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſave one we took with us, we departed for the Iſlands of <hi>Cape de Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> intending there to take in Water, for that from thence we intended ſtraight for <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil</hi> without touching Land. And having the Wind at N. E. and E. N. E. Trade Winds being uſual in thoſe places, we Coaſted <hi>Bonaviſta,</hi> and the next day, <hi>Jan.</hi> 28. we came to Anchor in the Weſt part of the Iſland <hi>Maio</hi> in 15 deg. being high Land, ſave only the Northweſt part, a League from the Sea very low, and is Inhabited by the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:93865:34"/>
Landing here we found a great many rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Houſes with a poor naked Chappel. The Springs and Wells were ſtopped up, and we could have no Water for our uſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we marched up to ſeek ſome, or at leaſt to ſee if the People could be prevailed with to help us. In this Journey we found the ſoil very fruitful, full of Fig-Trees, and in the Valleys, where their Cottages were, Vineyards bearing ripe Grapes, tho now in Winter, (the Sun ſcarce ever withdrawing himſelf from them.) There were alſo <hi>Coco</hi> Trees, no branches ſprouting forth but at the Top, with ſeveral others. We found good Water in ſeveral places, but being far off the Road, we could not carry it to our Ships. The People would not come near us, keeping themſelves cloſe in their Houſes.</p>
            <p>This Iſland hath great ſtore of Goats, Hens, and Salt made Naturally by the Suns heat, ſo that of the product thereof, they keep continual Traffick with the adjacent Iſlands. We departed thence <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. Next day we paſſed St. <hi>Jago</hi> 10 Leagues Weſt in the ſame Latitude, inhabited by <hi>Portugals,</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi> The <hi>Portugals</hi> being former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſole Lords of that Country, uſed that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor towards their Slaves, that they were forced to try ſome means of help, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fled to the Mountainous parts, where
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93865:34"/>
by continual eſcapes encreaſing to a great number, they now live in that terror of their oppreſſors that they endure no leſs bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in mind than formerly in Body; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the damages in their goods and Cattel, they ſuffer dayly from them.</p>
            <p>On the South-weſt of this Iſland, we took a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> laden with Wine, Wollen and Linnen Cloath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bound for <hi>Brazil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we paſſed by in ſight of 3 of their Towns, they ſhot off 3 great Pieces, which we anſwered.</p>
            <p>Twelve Leagues South of St. <hi>Jago</hi> lies that Iſland called by the <hi>Portugueſe Fogo,</hi> the Burning Iſland, in which riſeth a ſteep Hill 6 Leagues high, within the bowels of which is a conſtant fire, which breaketh out with violence 4 times an hour. Herein is engendered a great quantity of Pumice ſtones, which being by the Vehemency of the Fire, carried up into the Air, fall down upon the Hill, and many times into the Sea. The reſt of the Iſland is fruitful, and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by <hi>Portugals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two Leagues to the South of this Iſland, lies a pleaſant Iſland, full of Trees, which are always green, whence it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Brave Iſland,</hi> being a Storehouſe of many Fruits, as Figs, Coco's Plantons, Oranges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> full of pleaſant ſtreams of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93865:35"/>
Water: But there is no convenient Road for Ships. For after long ſounding, we could find no ground at any hand, neither was it ever known that any line would fetch ground in any place about the Iſland. So that the Top of <hi>Fogo,</hi> burneth not ſo high in the Air, but that the root of <hi>Brava</hi> is buried as low in the Seas. The only Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of this Iſland is an Hermite, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for we ſaw but one Houſe, built as it ſeems for ſuch purpoſe; and he was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in his ſolitary life, that he would by no means abide our coming, but fled, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him a Croſs with a Crucifix, and ſuch other Idolatrous traſh.</p>
            <p>Here we diſmiſſed the <hi>Portugals,</hi> taken at St. <hi>Jago,</hi> and gave them for their Ship our new Pinnace, with Proviſion to carry them home.</p>
            <p>Having thus taken in freſh Water, we departed, <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. and fell with the Coaſt of <hi>Brazil, Apr.</hi> 5. 1578. during which Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, where we ſaw nothing but Sea and Air; as we beheld the wonderful Works of God in his creatures, ſo likewiſe we did taſt the goodneſs thereof, for relief of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. We often had adverſe Winds, and ſometimes Calms, and alſo terrible Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Thunder, yet with a mixture of comforts; for it pleaſed God that (whereas
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93865:35"/>
we were but badly furniſhed with Water) when we were within 4 degrees of the Line on this ſide, and paſt it ſo many on the other, we had every day ſome rain, whereby our want of Water was much ſupplied. This was alſo obſervable, that notwithſtanding the badneſs of the paſſage, and Storms we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had, yet not one of us loſt our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſave only the <hi>Portugal</hi> prize for one day, but next day found us again.</p>
            <p>Among the many ſtrange creatures we ſaw, we took particular notice of a flying Fiſh, as big as the ordinary Pilchards, its fins are of the length of its whole body, reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſupplying the uſe of Wings; for therewith, when it is chaſed by bigger Fiſh, and cannot eſcape by Swimming, it lifteth it ſelf above the Water, and flyeth a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty height, ſometimes lighting on Boats or Barks: The Quils thereof are proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſet together, with a thin Film, ſo that they would ſerve for a longer or higher flight, but that the dryneſs of them is ſuch, that unleſs moiſtned every 10 or 12 ſtrokes, they grow ſtiff and unfit for motion. The encreaſe of this Creature is wonderful, which if it had not been ſo, their kind could not have been continued, they being a prey to ſo many Creatures. And when they flee into the Air, in ſhunning one hazard, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93865:36"/>
incur another by ſome ravenous Foul.</p>
            <p>When we came within 3 Leagues of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil,</hi> in 31 deg. 30 min. South latitude, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 12 Fathom Water, we were deſcried by the Inhabitants, and we ſaw huge fires made by them in ſeveral places, which cuſtom though it be univerſal among Chriſtians and Heathens, yet is differently uſed by them, to wit, for a ſacrifice to Devils, with many other conjurations, caſting up heaps of ſand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that if any Ships ſtay upon their Coaſt, their miniſtring Spirits may make wrack of them, which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have found to their loſs. But this deviliſh intent of theirs was of no effect to us, for though we had great Storms, yet we ſuſtained no da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage but the ſeparating our Ships. And ſeeing we could find no Harbor thereabout we coaſted along Southward, till <hi>April</hi> 14 in the morning we paſſed by <hi>Cape</hi> St. <hi>Mary</hi> in 35 deg. near the mouth of the River <hi>Plate,</hi> and running within it 6 or 7 Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues we came to Anchor under another <hi>Cape</hi> which our General after called <hi>Cape Joy,</hi> becauſe the ſecond day after our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring here, the <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> we had loſt in the former ſtorm, came to us again. The cares our General took beſides the main care of effecting our Voyage, were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93865:36"/>
theſe; to keep our whole Fleet together; to get freſh Water for our men; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh them when wearied. And therefore at our departure from <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> the next place of meeting, if we ſhould be diſperſed, or for Watering, was appointed to be the River of <hi>Plate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Country thereabout is temperate, of a ſweet Air, and fruitful ſoyl: and hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, plenty of large Deer.</p>
            <p>We removed hence 12 Leagues further, where was a long trace of Rocks, not far from the Main, making a commodious Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, eſpecially againſt the South-wind, and rode till the <hi>20th</hi> day, where we killed ſtore of Seals. We weighed again hence and ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further up the River till we had but 3 Fathom, and were in freſh Water, but becauſe the Winds were ſtrong, and we could have no ſafe Harbor there, we went to Sea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Apr.</hi> 27. The Land here lieth, S. S. W. and N. N. E. with ſhoal water ſome 3 or 4 Leagues off into the Sea; it's in 36 deg. 20 min. or better, South. Latitude.</p>
            <p>At our coming to Sea the <hi>Swan</hi> loſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of us. And therefore our General to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like in thoſe that remained, knowing that the Coaſt (it drawing now toward Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) uſes to be ſubject to tempeſtuous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, determined to ſeek out ſome conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93865:37"/>
Harbor, and ſearched all that Coaſt from 36 to 47 deg. but found none. And <hi>May</hi> 8. by another Storm the <hi>Caunter</hi> was ſevered from us. <hi>May</hi> 12 we ſaw Land in 47 deg. where we came to Anchor in ſuch Road as we could for the time. Our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral named the place <hi>Cape Hope,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Bay within, which promiſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Harbor. But by reaſon of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rocks lying off it, we durſt not hazard our Ships into it, without trial firſt made.</p>
            <p>Our General (who never was wont in matters of importance to truſt to other mens care) went himſelf with ſome others in a Boat, <hi>May</hi> 13. to ſound it out: and being now nigh the Shore, ſuddenly a thick fog aroſe with a great tempeſt; our General thought it now beſt to return to his Ship but the fog was ſo thick that, they could ſee none of us. Captain <hi>Thomas</hi> out of love to our General, hazarded in with his Ship, where he found him, and received him aboard, and then dropt an Anchor there, and lay ſafe during the Storm, while we were toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at Sea. The next day the weather being fair, our General went aſhore, that he might by making of fires gave ſigns to the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ships to come together again, whereby at laſt they all met except the <hi>Swan</hi> and our <hi>Portugal</hi> prize, the <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:93865:37"/>
In this place (the people being fled for fear of our coming) we found near the Rocks, in houſes made for that purpoſe, 50 <hi>Oſtriches</hi> at leaſt, with other Foul, ſome dryed and ſome drying for their proviſion. The <hi>Ostriches</hi> Thighs were as big as ordinary Legs of Mutton; they cannot flie, but run ſo ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that a man cannot overtake them, nor come within ſhot of them: we found the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the people uſe to take them with: Among others this is one; they have a large Plum of Feathers tyed together upon the end of a Staff, in the fore part reſembling the Head, Neck and Bulk of an <hi>Oſtrich;</hi> in the hinder part, ſpreading it ſelf out ſo large as to hide the Body of a man: with this they drive them into ſome neck of Land by the Sea, where ſpreading long Nets, with their Dogs, they overthrow them. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is very pleaſant, and of a fruitful Soil. Being afterwards driven to this place again, we had great familiarity with the people, who rejoyeed at our return, becauſe we had done no hurt this time: But becauſe this place was not fit for our purpoſe we depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>May</hi> 15. and held our courſe S. and by W. In 47 deg. 30 min. we found a Bay convenient for us, in which we Anchored <hi>May</hi> 17. and the next day went further in, where we abode 15 days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:93865:38"/>
The firſt day of our arrival here, our General ſent Captain <hi>Winter</hi> Southward, he himſelf going to the North, in ſearch of the 2 Ships, and it pleaſed God he met with the <hi>Swan,</hi> which he brought with him into the Harbor; where being unladen, ſhe was caſt off, and her Iron work and other neceſſaries reſerved for uſe, the remainder being made fire-wood. The other Ship we could not as yet hear of.</p>
            <p>After a little ſtay here, ſome of our men being aſhore, in an Iſland near the Main, the People of the Country ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to us, with Leaping, Dancing, Shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after their manner; Our General ſent a Boat ſtraight to them, with Knives, Bells, Bugles and ſuch things, whereupon they aſſembled on a Hill near the Water-ſide &amp; ſent 2 of their Company, running one after the other with great grace, but when they drew near, they halted, refuſing to come to our men; which our men perceiving ſent ſuch things as they had, and laid them in their view, and as ſoon as our men were departed they came and took them, leaving in exchange thereof Feathers, and Bone made in faſhion of a Toothpike, carved about the top, 6 Inches long. Whereupon our General with divers others at low Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter went over to the Main.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:93865:38"/>
Againſt his coming they remained ſtill on the Hill ſetting themſelves all in one Rank, ordaining one of them to run from one end of it to the other, and back again, Eaſt and Weſt, holding his hands over his Head, and yielding forward his Body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the riſing and ſetting of the Sun, and every 2d or 3d turn erecting it towards the body of the People after their ridiculous manner. When they ſaw us aſcending the Hill to them, they ſeem'd afraid. Which our General ſeeing retired, whereby they were confirmed we had no deſign to injure them, and came down with great ſpeed after us, and trafficked with us. The wares we had from them were Arrows of Reeds, Feathers, and Bones as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>They go Naked, except a Skin of Fur they caſt about their ſhoulders, when they ſit in the cold; but when they are doing any work, they gird it about their Loins. They wear their Hair long, and when they Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel they put it up with a roll of <hi>Oſtrich</hi> Feathers, uſing theſe rolls likewiſe for Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and for carrying proviſion, ſome on either ſide within theſe rolls (for a ſign of honor) have a large and plain Feather ſhewing like horns a far off.</p>
            <p>They paint their Bodies, with divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: ſome waſh their Faces with Sulphur;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93865:39"/>
ſome paint their whole Bodies black leaving only their Neck white; ſome one Shoulder black another white, and their Sides and Legs after the ſame manner, the black part hath ſet upon it white Moons, and the white black Suns, the Marks and Characters of their Gods.</p>
            <p>This advantage (I conceive) they have of painting their Bodies; that it Armeth them againſt the nipping cold, for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours being ſoakt into the inner part of their skin, fills up the pores ſo cloſe that no cold can enter. They have clean, comely and ſtrong Bodies, they are ſwift of foot and Active.</p>
            <p>It's ſtrange to think how they having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before known Chriſtians, in a ſhort time were ſo kind, judging us a People they ought to ſerve, not injure, eſteeming our General as a Father, us as Brethren. One of the chiefeſt of them receiving a Cap of our Generals went a little from us, and pierced hie Leg with an Arrow till the Blood ſtreamed, hereby ſignifying his unfeigned Love. They were in all, that converſed with us, about 50.</p>
            <p>In the Southermoſt part of this Bay there is a freſh Water River wherein are a great many Iſlands, of which ſome have ſuch ſtore of Seals as would mantain an Army of men:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93865:39"/>
others are in like ſort repleniſhed with Foul. We could not perceive that People had any Boats, or Canows to come to theſe Iſlands. Their Victuals for ought we ſaw they eat raw. They go all Armed with Bows an Elve long, with Arrows of Reeds, and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Flint-ſtone Artificially cut and faſtened.</p>
            <p>This Bay by reaſon of plenty of Seals we called <hi>Seal Bay</hi> (for we killed 200 in one hour.) And being now well provided, we Sailed thence <hi>June</hi> 3. towards the Pole <hi>Antarctick. June</hi> 12. we Anchored in a little Bay and ſtayed 2 days, diſcharging our Caunter the <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> which we laid up here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 14. We departed and kept our courſe till the <hi>17th.</hi> then we Anchored in a Bay in 50 deg. 20 min. diſtant not above a degree off the mouth of the <hi>Streights,</hi> through which lay our way to the South Sea.</p>
            <p>Here our General altered his courſe, and ſteered Northward, to ſeek after our Ship we had loſt, becauſe that if we entred the <hi>Streight</hi> without them, it would go hard with them. And next day being <hi>June</hi> 19. towards night, within a few Leagues of St. <hi>Julian</hi> we found her: and becauſe both Ship and men were diſtreſſed by weather,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93865:40"/>
our General bare into St. <hi>Julian, June</hi> 20. that he might repair her, and refreſh them. It ſtandeth in 49 deg. 3 min. South. Lat. and hath on the South ſide of the Harbor picked Rocks, and in the Harbor many Iſlands. Being come to Anchor, our General with ſome of his Company, rowed further in a Boat, to find out a place for Watering. At his landing 2 of the Inhabitants (by <hi>Magellane</hi> called <hi>Patagous</hi> or <hi>Pentagours</hi> from their huge ſtature, and ſtrength) vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited him, ſeeming to rejoyce at his arrival: taking great pleaſure in ſeeing Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> (Maſter Gunner of the Admiral) ſhoot an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arrow, trying to ſhoot with him, but were far ſhort of him.</p>
            <p>Another of theſe came up, and checkt his fellows for their familiarity with us, and dealt with them to become our Enemies; which our General and his men not ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, uſed them as before, and one <hi>Robert Winter</hi> ſhooting an Arrow at length, his Bow-ſtrings broke; which they ſeeing, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that more than our other weapons, took courage, and coming behind them, while they, ſuſpecting nothing, were going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Boat, ſhot at him who had the Bow, that he might not ſtring it again, and wounded him in the Shoulder, whereupon he turning about was with another Arrow
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93865:40"/>
ſhot through his Lungs, yet he fell not. And the Maſter Gunner diſcharging his Calliver, which miſcarried, was ſlain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. In this extremity our General, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having himſelf Wiſely and Couragiouſly, ordered his men to ſhift from place to place, encroaching upon the Enemy, and to uſe their Targets and other weapons for their defence, and to break as many Arrows as they could come by; knowing that their Arrows being ſpent, they could have them at their pleaſure. And he himſelf ſhooting off the Calliver, diſpatched the beginner of the quarrel, who had killed our Maſter Gunner, whereby the courage of his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners was abated, ſo that they were glad to ſave themſelves by flight. Our General choſe rather to depart, than take revenge, that he might ſave one of his men who was dangerouſly wounded, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding dyed 2 days after he was carried aboard. Our Gunners Body being left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore that night, our General next day with his Boat well manned, went aſhore to fetch it, which they found lying where it was left, but ſtript of his outer Garment and an Arrow ſtuck in his right Eye. Both theſe Bodies were decently interred in one Grave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:93865:41"/>
               <hi>Magellane,</hi> rightly termed them Giants; for they differ from the common ſort of men, in Stature, Bigneſs, Strength of Body and Hideouſneſs of Voice, but they are not ſo monſtrous or Giant like as reported, there being ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> men as tall as they. But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> cruelties have made them more monſtrous in mind than they are in Body, and inhoſpitable to Strangen. Notwithſtanding, the terror they conceived of us, ſo quench't their heat, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got revenge, and ſeeming to repent of the wrong done us, ſuffered us to do what we would for 2 months ſpace without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation.</p>
            <p>To this evil received of them, a greatr was deviſed among our ſelves, but it was detected and prevented in time, which if it had taken, our General and his faithful Friends, had been murthered, to the final fruſtrating of our whole deſign.</p>
            <p>This Plot had been contrived at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and was diſcovered to our General there, yet our General gave no credit to it, as being a perſon he had ſuch affection to. And therefore afterward he not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his favour (to this ſuſpected perſon) but uſed him as his boſom friend. And he was often offended at them who diſcovered the Treachery to him. But at length per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93865:41"/>
his lenity did no good, and that his Ambition was not allyed, he reſolved to call his practices in queſtion before it were too late. And therefore aſſembling his Captains he had him before them, where the Gentleman knowing himſelf Guilty, ſhewing great remorſe for his unkind deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beſought them to execute juſtice upon him. Whereupon they all adjudged him worthy of death. This judgments was held aſhore in one of the Iſlands of that Port, which in memory of that was called the Iſland of <hi>True Juſtice and Judgment.</hi> He deſired to receive the Sacrament before his death, which was granted. And <hi>John Fletcher,</hi> Preacher of the Fleet adminiſtred it to him: Our General likewiſe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with him: afterwards they dined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as lovingly as ever they had done, and took their farewel as they had only been going a Journey. After dinner the ſentence was executed upon him, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great remorſe for that heinous crime, and great ſigns of devotion at his death. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we buried him, ſetting a Mill-ſtone we found there, broke in two, at his head and feet, and engraved thereod the names of our men that were buried, and a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of our Captains name in Latine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93865:42"/>
After he was executed, our General diſcharging the <hi>Mary,</hi> our <hi>Portugal</hi> Prize, (being leak) defaced her; and having Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and Trimmed our Ships, and reduced our Fleet to 3 Ships, beſides our Pinnaces, we departed this Port, <hi>Aug.</hi> 3. and ſet our courſe for the <hi>Streight,</hi> S. W.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aug.</hi> 20. We fell with the <hi>Cape,</hi> near which is the entrance into the <hi>Streight,</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> called <hi>Capo Virgin Maria,</hi> appearing at 4 Leagues diſtance, with ſteep gray Cliffs full of black Stars, againſt which the Sea beating repreſents the ſpouting of Whales, the higheſt Cape being like Cape <hi>Vincent</hi> in <hi>Portugal.</hi> At this Cape our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cauſed his Fleet in homage to our Soveraign Lady the Queens Majeſty, to ſtrike their Top-ſails: and in remembrance of his Honourable Friend, Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton,</hi> he changed the name of his Ship from the <hi>Pelicane</hi> to the <hi>Golden Hind.</hi> Which being ended with a Sermon, and Prayers, and Thanksgiving for her Majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we continued our courſe into the ſaid Frete, and came into a narrow Strait exceeding dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, it lyeth W. N. W. and E. S. E. and having loſt it we came to a large Sea; the night following, we had an Iſland in ſight equal to <hi>Fogo</hi> in height, and burning like it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:93865:42"/>
It hath formerly been reported as truth, that the Seas have a continual current from Eaſt to Weſt in this <hi>Streight,</hi> but we found it otherwiſe, the Ebbings and Flowings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as orderly here as on other Coaſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. We fell with 3 Iſlands bearing Triangle wiſe one from another, in one of them, being large and Fruitful, our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with ſome of his men landed, taking poſſeſſion of it in Her Majeſties name, and called it the <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Iſland. In the other 2, which were not ſo large, we found good ſtore of ſtrange Birds, which could not fly at all, nor run ſo faſt as to eſcape us; they are leſs than a Gooſe, and bigger than a Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, ſhort, and well ſet together, having no Feathers, but in ſtead thereof a ſort of hard and matted Down: their Beeks are like the Bills of Crows, they lodge and breed on Land, where making earths as Coneys do in the Ground, they lay their Eggs. They feed on the Sea, where they ſwim incredibly ſwift. In one day we killed 3000 of them. Theſe 2 Iſlands our General named, the one St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s the other St. <hi>George</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>In the Iſland of St. <hi>George</hi> we found the Body of a man ſo long dead before, that his bones fell aſunder, being moved out of the place they lay in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:93865:43"/>
From theſe Iſlands to the entry of the South Sea the Frete is very crooked. And though it be true that <hi>Magellane</hi> reporteth of this paſſage that there are many fair Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and ſtore of freſh Water, yet when any contrary Winds ariſe, it is extremely dangerous.</p>
            <p>The Land on both ſides is high and Mountainous, having on the North and Weſt the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> on the South and Eaſt nothing but Iſlands, among which lye innumerable Fretes into the South Sea, the Mountains are prodigious for height, being ſtill encreaſed with congealed Clouds, and frozen Meteors, which are ſcarce ever diminiſhed by the heat of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Yet the plain grounds are fruitful, the Graſs plenteous, Herds many of very ſtrange ſorts, the Trees for moſt part always green, the Air temperate as ours.</p>
            <p>When we approached the entrance of the South Sea, we were ſo ſhut up to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and had ſuch large and open Fretes to the South, we knew not what way to paſs, without further diſcovery; and that our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, Anchored the Fleet under an Iſland, went with ſome others in a Boat, to find the paſſage, which having done they returned, meeting with a Canow under the ſame I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93865:43"/>
which was made of the Bark of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Trees, having a Prow and Stern ſtanding up, and Semicircle wiſe yielding inward: the Body of moſt excellent Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip: ſo that our General concluded that it was not contrived by the Art, nor for the uſe of ſuch rude people as theſe: it had no other caulking in the Seams but ſtitching with thongs made of Skins, and yet kept out the Water,</p>
            <p>The People are of a low ſtature, but compact, they paint as the others do. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Iſland they had a mean Cottage of Poles covered with the skins of Beaſts.</p>
            <p>Their Veſſels and Cups are of Barks of Trees. Their working-tools they uſe are knives made of huge and monſtrous Muſſel ſhels, which after they have broke off the thin and brittle ſubſtance of the Edge, they grind upon ſtones, till they have put ſuch an Edge on them that they will cut the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wood, yea the hardeſt Bones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 6. We got free of theſe Iſlands and entred the South Sea; at the Cape where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our General intended to have gone aſhore, and there after a Sermon Preached, to have left a Monument of her Majeſty, Engraven in Mettal; but could not conveniently.</p>
            <p>By all our obſervations we conluded that this Strait was 150 Leagues in length, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93865:44"/>
bredth in ſome places more, in others leſs; and in the end found it to be no Strait, but only Iſlands.</p>
            <p>When our General ſaw that our men were not able to endure the cold he intended to have returned toward the Line, leſt our men by the exceſſive cold might contract ſome grievous diſtemper; but it pleaſed God to thwart his deſign. For the 2d. day after we entred <hi>Mare Pacificum,</hi> a Furious ſtorm with contrary Winds aroſe, whereby we were in great Jeopardy of our lives,</p>
            <p>In the time of this ſtorm, <hi>Sept.</hi> 15. the Moon was Eclipſed in <hi>Aries,</hi> and darkned about 3 points for 2 hours; but our ſtorm continued 52 days. And <hi>Sept. 30th.</hi> in the night, the ſtorm encreaſing, the <hi>Marigold</hi> was ſeparated from us; whom we never met again, altho our General had ordered, that if any of our Fleet loſt our Company, we ſhould meet again on the Coaſts of <hi>Peru</hi> in 30 deg. or thereabout.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Sept.</hi> 7. (when the ſtorm began) till <hi>Oct.</hi> 7. we could not recover Land (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven to 37 deg. of South. Lat.) and this day toward night entred a Harbor, on the aforeſaid Streight toward the South Sea, hoping to ſhelter till the ſtorm were over, but had not been there 3 hours, till by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the ſtorm, our Admiral loſt an
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93865:44"/>
Anchor by the violence of the Flaw, and alſo loſt ſight of our Vice-Admiral the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> which we never ſaw more, for ſhe arrived in <hi>England, June</hi> 20. next year. So that now our Admiral was left alone, and altho our General ſought the reſt of his Fleet carefully, yet could by no means find them. Thus parted from our friends, we were driven back into 55 deg. South Lat. among the Iſlands aforeſaid. And after we had been there 2 days, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little refreſht our ſelves, of a ſudden a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſtorm aroſe, whereby we were in extreme hazard of our lives, and expected to be ſwallowed up every moment. But it pleaſed God of his infinite mercy, when all our hopes were gone, miraculouſly to deliver us. Being thus delivered, we were neceſſitated to ſeek for ſome place of refuge, both to provide neceſſaries, and refreſh our men. We returned among the ſaid I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands, where we hoped for better reſt, and the rather becauſe we found the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Country travelling from one place to another, with whom we trafficked for ſeveral commodities, and had reſpite for 3 days, being in continual fear of the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers, the troubled Seas, and bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Winds threatned us; which accordingly happened; for we were aſſaulted by a more
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93865:45"/>
vehement ſtorm, leaving behind us our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and a great part of our Cable, driven betwixt Wind and Water, till we fell with the uttermoſt part of the Land, towards the South Pole, when we diſcovered how far the ſame reacheth South ward from the Coaſt of <hi>America</hi> aforenam'd.</p>
            <p>The uttermoſt Cape of theſe Iſlands lyes in 56 deg. where no Mainland nor Iſland is to the South, but the <hi>Atlantick</hi> and South Sea met.</p>
            <p>It was hitherto dreamed that theſe Iſlands were a Main, and that it was <hi>Terra Incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita,</hi> and truly it might be ſo called before this time, for before this it was never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that we heard of.</p>
            <p>And here we may refute that error, held by many, that it is impoſſible to return out of <hi>Mare del Zur</hi> into the Ocean, by reaſon of the ſuppoſed Eaſtern Current, and Levant Winds; for neither did we meet with ſuch Current, nor had ſuch Winds to carry us through, but always in our paſſage found it eaſier to return into the Weſt Ocean than to go forward into <hi>Mare del Zur;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we had much experience, being glad oft times to alter our courſe, and fall a ſtern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, with frank Wind, further in one After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, than we could fetch up again in a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93865:45"/>
whole day with a reaſonable gale. They are no leſs miſtaken in alledging the narrowneſs of the Frete; for we found the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>As we reached the utmoſt part of theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands, <hi>Oct.</hi> 28. our ſtorm ceaſed. Here we found the night in the latter end of <hi>Octob.</hi> not above 2 hours long, ſo that it ſeems, when the Sun is in the Tropick of <hi>Caprioorn</hi> they have little or no night. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants Manners Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are, the ſame with thoſe aforementioned, before we entred the <hi>Streights.</hi> Our General called theſe Iſlands <hi>Elizabethides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oct.</hi> 30. We departed thence ſteering our courſe North-weſt, to coaſt along <hi>Peru</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the appointed place for our Fleet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſemble) the next day we came to 2 Iſlands, wherein were great ſtore of Birds, whereof we were ſufficiently furniſhed with Victuals; Thence, ſteering ſtill North-weſt, we found our ſelves, like to have been deceived in taking our rules by the common Maps, which ſet down the Coaſt of <hi>Peru</hi> to lye 12 deg. Northwards from the ſuppoſed <hi>Streight</hi> when it is quite contrary, and therefore we altered our Courſe.</p>
            <p>That part of <hi>Peru</hi> all along to the height of <hi>Lima</hi> being 12 deg. South of the Line, is mountainous and barren, except a few
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93865:46"/>
places Inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and ſome others.</p>
            <p>Being thus fallen with the Land, we Coaſted along till we came to 37 deg. and finding no convenient place, nor likelyhood of hearing of our Ships, we ran off with an Iſland in ſight called by the <hi>Spaniards Mucho,</hi> where we Anchored <hi>Nov.</hi> 25. and found it to be a fruitful Iſland, well ſtored with all neceſſaries, as Sheep, and other Cattel, Maiz, a kind of Grain they make Bread of, <hi>Potatos</hi> and ſuch other Roots beſides it is plenteous of Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are ſuch <hi>Indians</hi> as by the cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were driven from the Main. With them our General intended to Traffick for Victuals and Water; and for that end the ſame night we arrived, he and ſome others went aſhore, to whom the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhewed reſpect, making a preſent to our General; we alſo preſented them ſuch things as we had, ſignifying that we came to Traffick, and recruit our ſelves with freſh Water; and they promiſed to furniſh us with ſuch things as they could afford. The next day our General repaired to the ſhore, and ſent 2 of his men, with their <hi>Baricoes</hi> to the Watering place aſſigned, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſt half of the way, were traiterouſly ſlain by the People; who having likewiſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93865:46"/>
ſet an ambuſh for our General and the reſt of our men that were in the Boat, behind the Rocks, ſuddenly wounded moſt of our men, before they could free themſelves; our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral beſides ſeveral wounds on the face and head, had one paſſing through his Noſe into the <hi>Baſis Cerebri.</hi> But the worſt of all was, we had none to cure our men ſave a Surgeons Boy, yet it pleaſed God they were all cured. The cauſe of this barbarity of theſe Iſlanders was their hatred to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> (whom they ſuſpected us to be.) Our General tho he might have revenged this with ſmall loſs, yet valuing the loſs of one of his more than 100 of theirs, he deſiſted, committing his cauſe to God. The weapons this People uſe in their Wars are Arrows of Reeds with heads of Stones very brittle and indented, and Darts of a great length headed with Iron, or Bone. The ſame day that this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened we departed thence, and becauſe we were nownear the appointed place of meeting, and partly becauſe our men were craſie, we ſet in for ſome convenient place in the Main, and coming to the Bay called <hi>Philips-Bay</hi> in about 32 deg. we dropt Anchor, and ſent our Boat to diſcover, if the place could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with ſuch things as we needed; they after long Travel, could ſee no appearance of relief, either as to Victuals or Water,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93865:47"/>
ſeeing nothing ſave huge heads of wild Buffs; but in their return, they eſpied an <hi>Indian</hi> fiſhing in his Canow, whom they brought aboard. Who being courteouſly entertained, after we had ſhewed him what we had, and made him underſtand what we needed, we ſent him away with our Boat and his own Canow to land him where he would; who at his landing, willed our men to ſtay till his return, and anon met 2 or 3 of his friends, to whom he ſhewed his gifts; which gave ſuch content, that a little after, he with their Governour and others came to us, bringing with them Hens, Eggs, Hogs and ſuch like, and (that they might remove ſuſpicion of evil) they ſent it in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now by it ſelf, and their Governor entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to our men, and came to our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. By him we underſtood, we could not be relieved here, but he offered to conduct us to a Harbor not far diſtant to the Southward, where we might have all neceſſaries; which our Gen. accepted of; and <hi>Dec.</hi> 4. depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hence, and next day came to an Anchor in that Harbor. It is called by the <hi>Spaniards Valperizo,</hi> and the Town adjoyning St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Chinly;</hi> it is in 35 deg. 40 min. here we had all neceſſaries in abundance: amongſt other things we found in the Town, diverſe ſtore-houſes of the Wines of <hi>Chinly,</hi> and in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93865:47"/>
the Harbor a Ship called the <hi>Captain</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> or the <hi>Grand Captain of the South, Admiral to the Iſlands of</hi> Salomon, laden moſtly with the ſaid Wines, and beſides, ſome fine Gold of <hi>Baldivia, &amp;c.</hi> We ſpent ſometime in refreſhing our ſelves, and eaſing this Ship of her burden, and <hi>Dec.</hi> 8. being furniſhed with neceſſaries we departed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning back to the Line, with our <hi>Indian</hi> Pilot, whom our General rewarded to his own content, and ſet him aſhore again where he deſired.</p>
            <p>Being thus provided our General was for ſeeking after our Ships; And conſidering that we could not conveniently run in with our Ship to every Harbor, and that our Boat could not carry men enough, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the violence of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> if we happen'd to meet them, we determined, as we went toward the Line to ſeek out a convenient place, where we might trim our Ship, and build a Pinnace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dec.</hi> 19. We entred a Bay to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Town of <hi>Cyppo</hi> Inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in 29 deg. 30 min. and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving landed 14 of our men to ſearch, we were diſcovered by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſent out 300 men, 100 of them being <hi>Spaniards,</hi> well mounted on Horſes, the reſt <hi>Indians</hi> running as Dogs at their heels all naked.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93865:48"/>
But our men ſeeing them come, made all their eſcape, ſave one <hi>Richard Minivy,</hi> who being too bold, would not be entreated to eſcape with the reſt, but choſe either to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brave them, or die in the place; which he did. His Body was by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, his right hand cut off, his heart pluckt out, all which they carried away in our ſight, the reſt of his Body they cauſed the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> to ſhoot full of Arrows made of green wood, and left it, which we buried next day. Finding but bad entertainment here we departed, and next day came to a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Harbor to the Northward of it, in 27 deg. 55 min. South Lat. where we trimmed our Ship, and built our Pinnace; which done our General, with ſome of his Company went in the Pinnace, in ſearch of our Ships, but after a days ſailing, were forced to return by contrary wind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 9. we left this place, and <hi>Jan.</hi> 22. came to an Iſland in the ſame height with the North Cape of <hi>Mormorena;</hi> here we met with 4 <hi>Indians</hi> in their Canows, who promiſed to bring us to a place where we might Water, but when we came thither, we ſcarce found any. As we were ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Water, we lighted on a <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſleeping, who had by him 13 Bars of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, weighing 4000 <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Duccats which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93865:48"/>
we took. Not far from hence we met with another <hi>Spaniard</hi> with an <hi>Indian</hi> Boy, driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 8 <hi>Peruvian</hi> Sheep, each Sheep bearing 2 leathern bags, in each of which was 50 pound weight of fine Silver, which we likewiſe took.</p>
            <p>Beyond the Cape aforeſaid we paſſed ſeveral <hi>Indian</hi> Towns, the People whereof came to us in Boats made of ſeveral Skins, of which 2 being joyned together of equal length in form of a Boat, having in each of them a ſmall Gut, or ſome ſuch thing blown full of Wind, whereby it floateth, and is rowed very ſwiftly; they exchanged with us Fiſhes for Knives, Glaſſes and ſuch like, great rarities to them.</p>
            <p>Not far hence lies <hi>Mormorena</hi> in 22 deg. 30 min. where tho 2 <hi>Spaniards</hi> governed, yet we exchanged with them for ſeveral Commodities: among other things Sheep which were as big as a Cow, with ſtrength proportioned; on one of their backs at one time 3 men and a Boy might ſit without touching the ground by a foot, without any trouble; their Wool is very fine, their fleſh good, and they ſerve in ſtead of Horſes for burdens.

which ſtood in the fruitfulleſt ſoil in all that Coaſt; it is Inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> In 2 Barks here we found Forty and odd Bars of Silver, each weighing about 20 <hi>l.</hi> which we took; and ſo went to <hi>Chowley, Feb.</hi> 9. and in our way to <hi>Lima</hi> we took a Bark loaden with Linnen: <hi>Feb.</hi> 15. we arrived at <hi>Lima,</hi> and tho the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had 30 Ships in the Harbor, we Anchored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the midſt of them. <hi>Lima</hi> is in 12 deg. 30 min. Here we heard of a Ship that had 1500 Bars of Silver in her beſides other things we boarded her and took what we had a mind to. Here alſo we had news of the Ks. of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez</hi> all dead in one day at one Battel; alſo of the death of the K. of <hi>France</hi> and the Pope. Laſtly here we had notice of a rich Ship laden with Gold and Silver for <hi>Panama,</hi> that had ſet ſail from this Haven: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Feb.</hi> 16. we went in purſuit of her. <hi>Feb.</hi> 20. We fell with the Port of <hi>Paita</hi> in 4 deg. 40 m. with St. <hi>Helen</hi> and the River <hi>Gutaquil, Feb.</hi> 24. We paſt the Line 28, and <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. Fell with <hi>Franciſco,</hi> where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mid-day we deſcried a Sail, and when we had made up with her and boarded her, we found her to be the Ship we were purſuing: We found in her ſome Fruits, Conſerves, Sugars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a great quantity of Jewels,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93865:49"/>
and precious Stones, 13 Cheſts of Ryals of Plate, <hi>80l.</hi> weight of Gold, 26 Tun of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyned Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> valued about 360000 Pezoes. We gave the Maſter a little Linnen for theſe Commodities, and after 6 days de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>And being now come to Cape <hi>Franciſco</hi> in 1 deg. <hi>N.</hi> Lat. and hearing nothing of our Ships all the way, tho we enquired diligently, we concluded they were not before us; and conſidering that now was the only time (Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer approaching) for the diſcovery of what paſſage there was to be found about the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts of <hi>America</hi> from the South Sea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Ocean, which our General chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, we all willingly conſented to ſeek out a convenient place for furniſhing our ſelves, and trimming our Ship in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And ſo we ſet on <hi>March</hi> 7. to the Iſland of <hi>Caines</hi> at which we arrived <hi>March</hi> 16. and ſettled in a freſh River for our purpoſe aforeſaid. In our Journey hither, we met with a Ship laden with Linnen, and <hi>China</hi> Silk and Diſhes, and a Faulcon of Gold with a great Emerauld in its breaſt. We depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hence <hi>March</hi> 24. for our intended diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and paſſed by the Port <hi>Papagaia,</hi> and diverſe others, and ſome Gulphs which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſend forth violent Winds. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that if we did not run off to Sea
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93865:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we ſhould be troubled with Calms, our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral determined to go into ſome Port to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our ſelves with all neceſſaries, that we might go to Sea. And accordingly <hi>April</hi> 15. 1679. we entred <hi>Guatulco,</hi> in 15. deg. 46. min. inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where we had neceſſaries, as alſo a Pot as big as a Buſhel full of Ryals of Plate, with a Chain of Gold and Jewels.</p>
            <p>From thence we departed to Sea <hi>Apr.</hi> 16. and ſailed 500 Leagues for a Wind, and until <hi>June</hi> 23. 1500 Leagues in all, till we came to 42. deg. of North. Latitude, where in the Night time we were oppreſt with extreme nipping cold, whereby ſeveral of our mens health was impaired, and the day following notwithſtanding the heat of the Sun, the cold was nothing abated, ſo that the Ropes of our Ships were frozen, and the Rain which fell was a kind of Icy ſubſtance. And when we came 2 degrees further it was in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that our men could not make uſe of their hands, not to feed themſelves; and our Meat as it was removed from the fire was in a manner immediately frozen, whereby our men were extremely diſcouraged; yet by our Generals perſuaſions, they reſolved to endure a little extremity to obtain agreater Glory.</p>
            <p>The Land in that part of America lying
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93865:50"/>
nearer the Weſt, than we imagined, we were nearer it than we were aware; and the nearer it we came the colder it was. <hi>June</hi> 5. we were driven on the ſhore by contrary Winds, and caſt Anchor in a Bay, where we were in danger by reaſon of extream flaws that beat upon us, and upon their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion were troubled with thick, ſtinking Fogs.</p>
            <p>In this place we could not abide, by reaſon of cold, and therefore were forced to go Southwards again. From the height of 48. to 38. coaſting along the Land, we found it to be plain; every hill (which were many but not high) though it was <hi>June,</hi> was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Snow. <hi>June</hi> 17. in 38. deg. 30. min. we found a fit Harbor and anchored therein, continuing till <hi>July</hi> 23. and were ſtill moleſted with cold. We conjecture upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reaſons that either there is no Northern paſſage, or at leaſt not navigable, for to paſs by others this ſeems to confirm it, that tho we ſearched the Coaſt diligently even to 48. deg. yet found we not the Land to trend ſo much as one point in any place towards the Eaſt, but rather running on towards the Northweſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 18. The Countrey People ſent out a man in a Canow to us, who directed his diſcourſe to us all the way as he came;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93865:51"/>
and being come near us, he had a tedious Oration, uſing many motions; which ended with great ſhew of reverence he returned: He came again the 2d. time as alſo the 3d. after the ſame manner, and brought with him, as a preſent, a Bunch of Feathers arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially gathered on a ſtring, made for thoſe who guard the Kings Perſon to wear on their heads, he brought alſo a Basket made of Ruſhes, filled with an Herb, called <hi>Tabak.</hi> Our General proffered him ſeveral things, but he would receive nothing ſave a Hat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 21. Our Ship being leaky we put in to the ſhore to repair her; (but to prevent all danger, our General landed all his men, with neceſſary Proviſions to build Tents, and make a Fort for us; Which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People ſeeing, came down in great haſt to us with ſuch Arms as they had, yet with no intent to hurt us, their intent being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to worſhip us as Gods. And being willed by ſigns to lay from them their Bows and Arrows, they did it inſtantly.</p>
            <p>To the intent therefore that this Peace which was deſired might be more confirmed, our General treated them very courteouſly, beſtowing upon them Shirts, Linnen, and other things, to cover their nakedneſs, withal ſignifying unto them, that we were but men
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93865:51"/>
as they were, which notwithſtanding, we could hardy perſuade them of. They in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe beſtowed on our General and others of our men, Feathers, Cawls, and Quivers of their Arrows, made of Fawns Skins, and Skins of Beaſts their women wore; and ſo departed with joy to their Houſes; which are digged round within the earth, having clefts of Wood ſet up and joyned cloſe at the top, like our Spires; they are very warm and without Chimneys; Their Door is like an ordinary ſcuttle in a Ship ſlope-wiſe, their Beds on the Ground with Ruſhes ſtrewed upon it. Their men for moſt part go na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; They are of a tractable and loving Nature; Their only Weapons are Bows and Arrows, with which tho they are skillful they do but little execution, they are ſo ſlight, being more fit for Boys than men; they are prodigiouſly ſtrong and ſwift. Their Women make themſelves looſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a kind of Bulruſhes to cover their lower parts: about their ſhoulders wearing the Skin of a Deer; They are very obedient to their Husbands.</p>
            <p>When they were returned home they emitted lamentable Cryings, which we heard tho about an Engliſh Miles diſtance.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding their ſubmiſſive demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, our General thought it beſt not to truſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93865:52"/>
them too much, and, therefore with expedition we ſet up our Tents and entrenched our ſelves with a Stone-Wall, that ſo if they proved perfidious we might be able to repel them. Two days after a great multitude of them came to us, bringing preſents with them as before, or rather ſacrifices, they deeming us to be Gods.</p>
            <p>When they came to the top of the Hill at the bottom whereof we ſtayed, they ſtood, where one with ſtrange geſtures delivered a tedious Oration, at the end whereof all the reſt bowing their bodies cried <hi>Oh,</hi> (as a ſign of their aſſent;) after which their men came down, leaving their Women and Children, with their Bows on the Hill, with preſents to us, glad that we would receive them of them: in the mean time their Women fell a Crying, Shreeking, and tearing their Fleſh from their Cheeks, with a fury caſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Ground, daſhing themſelves on hard Stones or any thing it was in their way, thoſe that were big with Child not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from this madneſs. Which our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſeeing fell a praying with Hands lifted up to Heaven (ſhewing that God, whom we ſerved, and they ought to worſhip, was above) and ſung Pſalms, and read in the Bible: to all which they were very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and took ſuch delight in our Singing of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93865:52"/>
Pſalms, that every time they came to us they deſired us to ſing.</p>
            <p>Three days after the greateſt part of all that People thereabouts aſſembled, with the King attended with his Guard. Before his coming he ſent 2 Ambaſſadors to ſignifie it to us; in delivery of their meſſage, the one ſpoke low the other the ſame word for word more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly, which done our General underſtood by their ſigns that they deſired a preſent of him to their <hi>Hioh</hi> or King; which he ſent.</p>
            <p>As their King was coming to us, they cried after a ſinging manner; and as they drew near their carriage was more grave. In their Front a man bare the Scepter (a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of black Wood a Yard and a half in Length) before the King, whereon Hanged 2 Crowns with 3 long Chains, and a bag full of the Herb <hi>Tabah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next him that bare this Scepter was the King: on his head was a Cawl of Knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work ſomewhat like a Crown: on his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to his Waſt a Coat of Coney Skins; his Guard had Coats of other Skins, ſome having Cawls with ſuch Feathers, or covered with a Down, which groweth on an Herb like Lettice: This Herb is not permitted to be wore by any but thoſe that are about the King, and the ſeed of it is uſed only in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their Gods. After theſe came the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93865:53"/>
common People, naked, whoſe long hair was tied in a Bunch behind, in which ſtuck Plumes of Feathers, but in the fore part had but one Feather like a Horn. Every one had his Face painted, but of different colours. Their Women and Children came laſt, The Women had Baskets in their Arms, wherein were Bays of <hi>Tabah</hi> and other preſents: Their Baskets were made of Ruſhes, yet in ſuch ſort that moſt part of them would hold Water; they were hanged with pieces of Pearls Shells, and with 2 or 3 links of the Chains, ſignifying they were Veſſels dedicated to the uſe of their Gods.</p>
            <p>Our General aſſembled all his men and ordered them to be in a poſture of defence, that if they attempted any thing againſt us might we prevent it.</p>
            <p>When they came near us they gave us a general Salutation; after which he that bare the Scepter ſpake aloud what another whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered him in the ear for half an hour, which was ended with a general <hi>Amen;</hi> and all the reſt, ſave the Children, came down the Hill ſetting themſelves in their former order.</p>
            <p>Being come near us the Scepter-bearer with a ſtately carriage began a ſong, dancing thereto, as alſo did the King and all the reſt, ſave the Women, who danced but did not ſing. Our General perceiving their ſimple
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93865:53"/>
meaning ordered that they might have free entrance; they entring continued their Song and Dance a pretty while, their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men following with their Baskets, their faces <hi>&amp;c.</hi> torn as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Afterwards they made a ſign to our General to ſit down, and the King with others made ſeveral Speeches, eſiring him by ſigns to take upon him the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and afterwards with one conſent they ſet the Crown upon his Head, with other Ceremonies, honouring him by the name of <hi>Hyoh,</hi> ending the Solemnity with Songs and Dances.</p>
            <p>Theſe things our General accepted of, taking them in the Name and to the Uſe of Her Majeſty. The Ceremonies ended, the common People of them leaving the King with our General, went among our People, and finding ſuch as pleaſed their Fancies (which commonly were the youngeſt of us) they encloſing them round offered ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; Crying with lamentable ſhreeks, weeping, ſcratching, and tearing the fleſh off their Faces.</p>
            <p>After our neceſſary buſineſſes were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, our General with ſome of his Company went up into the Land, to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the Nature and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of their Country. The Inland we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93865:54"/>
found to be of a very fruitful ſoyl, Stored with all things fit for man, particularly fat Deer in great numbers. There were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a ſtrange ſort of Conies, their heads and bodies like other Conies, but ſmaller; their Tails like that of a Rat, and their Feet like the Paws of a Mole. Under their Chins on each ſide they have a Bag into which they gather their meat when their Bellies are full, to feed their young, or ſorve themſelves another time. Their Skins are of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for their Kings Holy-days coat is made of them.</p>
            <p>This Country our General called <hi>Albion,</hi> from the White Banks which lye toward the Sea.</p>
            <p>Before our departure thence, our General cauſed to be ſet up a Plate of Braſs nailed to a Poſt, with her Majeſties name and picture, and Arms on a Sixpence, the day and year of our Arrival, and of their reſigning the Kingdom into Her Majeſties hands, as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of Her Majeſties Right and Title to that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And now the time of our departure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, thoſe People, who had formerly ſo much joy in our Company, were now ſorrowful and dejected beyond all meaſure, all their former joy being metamorphoſed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93865:54"/>
into Mourning at the report of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 23. They took a ſorrowful Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of us, entreating us to remember them in our abſence, and to return to them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ran up to the tops of the Hills to keep ſight of us as long as they could, making Fires on all hands. Near this place lye ſome Iſlands, which we called the Iſlands of St. <hi>James,</hi> where we had a great many Seals and Birds.</p>
            <p>Our General now conſidering, that the cold encreaſed, the Sun being now nearer the South, left off his deſign of finding paſſage through the Northern parts, and therefore with conſent of the reſt bent his Courſe for the <hi>Moluccaes</hi> and ſailed without ſight of Land for 68 days ſpace, and <hi>Sept.</hi> 30. came to ſome Iſlands, lying in 8 deg. North. Lat. As ſoon as we were perceived, a great number of Canows came towards us, bringing with them Coquo's, Fiſh, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Canows, as moſt of the <hi>Moluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes</hi> are made of one Tree hollowed within with great art, very ſmooth; their Prow and Stern were of one faſhion, yielding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, very high, and hanged full of gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering ſhells; on each ſide their Canows
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93865:55"/>
lay out 2 pieces of Timber to keep them from overwhelming.</p>
            <p>The People have the nether part of their ears cut round hanging down on their Cheeks; the Nails on ſome of their Fingers were an Inch long, and their Teeth black as Pitch, the colour whereof they uſe to renew with a certain Powder. The firſt Company of thoſe Canows, began to Traffique with us peaceably, entreating us to go nearer the ſhore, that they might eaſilier prey upon us. But theſe paſſing away, others came that diſcovered their Natures, for when they got any thing in their hands, they would neither give recompence nor reſtore it; and being rejected for their bad dealing, they began to reſent it, throwing ſtones at us which they had brought on purpoſe; whereupon our General cauſed let fly a great Gun; at the noiſe of which they, frightned, leapt out of their Canows into the Water, and diving under the Keel of their Boat ſtayed there till we were gone a good way from them, and then recovered their Canows and made haſt to the ſhore. Notwithſtanding we were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards troubled with others of the ſame gang, and could not be rid of them, till we made them ſmart. And ſo we left this Iſland <hi>Octob.</hi> 23. naming it the <hi>Iſland of Thieves,</hi> and <hi>Octob.</hi> 16. fell with 4 Iſlands in 7 deg.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93865:55"/>
5 min. North. Lat. <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. we anchored at the biggeſt of them called <hi>Mindanao. Oct.</hi> 25. we paſſed by the Iſland <hi>Talao,</hi> and to the Northward of it ſaw 3 Iſlands, <hi>Teda, Selan, Saran:</hi> and <hi>Nov.</hi> 1. we paſt the Iſle <hi>Suaro</hi> in 1 deg. 30 min. and <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. came in ſight of the <hi>Moluccaes.</hi> They are 4 high picked Iſlands very fruithful, yielding abundance of Cloves. Eaſt from them lyes a great Iſland, called <hi>Gillola.</hi> We intended to go to <hi>Tidore,</hi> but coaſting an Iſland of the King of <hi>Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat's</hi> his Deputy came off to us, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated our General to ſtay at <hi>Terenate,</hi> for that his King would be glad of his coming, and would aſſiſt him to his utmoſt Power, whereas if he went to <hi>Tidore,</hi> (inhabited by <hi>Portugals)</hi> he would find them deceitful; and beſides, that then his King would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, as being at enmity with them. Hereupon our General next Morning came to an anchor there, and ſent a Meſſenger to the King, with a Velvet Cloak for a preſent: ſignifying to him, that he deſired to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with neceſſaries, for which he would give him other goods, and likewiſe that it was by perſuaſion of his Viceroy that he came thither. But before this the Viceroy had ſpoke to the King on our behalf, ſhewing how beneficial an Alliance with us would be to him, and how diſcouraging to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93865:56"/>
his Enemies. Whereupon the King imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent the Viceroy with others of his Nobles to our General, to ſhew him that he was ready to do any thing for us that lay in his power, upon our Prince's account; and that he would ſhortly viſit us in our Ship. By that time they came to us, our Meſſengers were at Court, who were honorably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the King, and moſt Graciouſly by him entertained. Whereupon the Prince haſtened his before promiſed viſit; the manner of his coming was thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, he ſent before 3 great Canows wherein were ſome of his Nobles of all ages, attired all in white Lawn, or Cloath of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecute, but with ſome difference, their Canow covered from one End to t'other with fine Mats, bore up by a frame of Reeds.</p>
            <p>The reſt were Souldiers ſtanding orderly on both ſides, without whom were the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, in 3 Galleries on each ſide, lying off the ſide 3 or 4 yards, one built lower than the other; in each of which Galleries was a like number of Banks that the Rowers ſate upon: On the forepart of each Canow ſate 2 men, one holding a Tabret, the other a piece of Braſs, who ſtriking therewith by the ſound directed the Rowers to keep their Strokes; and the Rowers ending their Strokes with a ſong, gave warning to the others to ſtrike
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93865:56"/>
again. They had in each Canow one ſmall Piece; beſides every man had his Sword, Dagger, and Target, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Canows coming near our Ship rowed round us one after another, and the men as they paſſed did us homage, the greateſt Perſons beginning; afterwards putting our Meſſenger aboard, they told us that their King had ſent them before him to conduct our Ship into a better Road.</p>
            <p>Not long after the King came up with 6 grave Fathers and did obeyſance to us in humble manner. He was of a tall ſtature, Corpulent, of a Princely Countenance. His reſpect among his Subjects was very great, none of his Councillors daring ſpeak to him but on their Knees.</p>
            <p>We received him in beſt ſort we could, as with diſcharging of Ordinance, and great ſtore of ſmall ſhot, ſounding of Trumpets, and other Inſtruments of Muſick, wherewith the King was extremely delighted. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, our General gave him ſome preſents. His Brother likewiſe made us a viſit, and was alſo courteouſly entertained by our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. The King when we came to Anchor, departed, promiſing to come aboard next day, and in the mean time to ſend us neceſſaries: Which the ſame night and next morning we had by way of Traffique, as Hens, Rice,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93865:57"/>
Sugar Canes, Liquid Sugar, a fruit they call <hi>Figo</hi> the ſame which the <hi>Portugals</hi> name <hi>Plantanes, Cocoes</hi> and a kind of Meal they call <hi>Sago,</hi> made of the tops of Trees, taſting like ſour Curds, but melting like Sugar. The Inhabitants make a kind of Cake thereof which will keep good ten years: We had alſo ſome Cloves. Our General having all things provided, expected the King at the time appointed; who came not, but ſent his Brother with his Apology, entreating our General to come a ſhore; that his Brother in the mean while ſhould remain aboard as a pledge for his ſafety; but the Company would by no means permit him, eſpecially for that his Brother had dropt ſome Words aboard which gave ſuſpicion of ill intent. Our General therefore in his ſtead ſent ſome of his Gentlemen with the Kings Brother to Court, detaining the Viceroy for a Pledge. They being come near the Caſtle were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by another of the King; Brothers and Perſons of Quality, and conducted honorably to the Caſtle; where being brought into a ſtately Houſe, a great multitude was there, the greateſt Perſons being placed round the Houſe according to their degrees, the reſt remaining without.</p>
            <p>The Houſe was four ſquare, covered with Cloath of diverſe colours, born up on a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93865:57"/>
Frame of Reeds, the ſides being open, and furniſhed with ſeats round; this it ſeems was their Council Houſe. At the ſide of this Houſe next the Caſtle, was ſeated the Chair of State, with a large Canopy over it; the ground alſo for 10 or 12 paces round it was covered with Cloath of Arras. There were ſeated 60 Ancient Noblemen, of the Kings Council; at the nether end of the Houſe, were a great Company of Young men in good attire; without on the right ſide of the Houſe were 4 old men attired in long red Garments, their heads after the Turkiſh Faſhion, who lived as Lidgiers there, to keep continual Traffique with this People, with ſeveral others of foreign Nations.</p>
            <p>The King at laſt coming attended by 8 or 10 Grave Senators had a rich Canopy born over him, guarded with 12 Lances, the points downwards; our men With His Brother met him, and were graciouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained.</p>
            <p>The Kings Attire was very ſumptuous; From his Waſte downwards was all rich Cloath of Gold, his Legs bare, on his Feet Shoes of Cordivant died red; on his Cap were diverſe Rings of plated Gold, an Inch and a half broad; a great Chain of Gold about his Neck; on his left hand a Diamond,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93865:58"/>
an Emerald, a Ruby and Turky; on his Right hand Rings ſet with rich Stones.</p>
            <p>As he ſate in his Chair of State, a Page ſtood by him with a Fan, richly embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Saphires. Our Gentlemen hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered their Meſſage, and received anſwer were ſafely conducted back again.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle was of no ſtrength, there being only 2 Cannons there, and thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, which were left by the <hi>Portugals</hi> by whom the Caſtle was built: Who by their Tyrannies exerciſed both on their King and People, which they did to confirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo incenſed the People that they were forced to leave it with their furniture in it.</p>
            <p>The People are <hi>Moors</hi> very ſuperſtitious in obſervations of New Moons, and Faſtings; For on thoſe days the Viceroy when aboard of us, would neither eat nor drink in the day, though in the Night he ate very largely.</p>
            <p>While we ſtayed here a goodly Gentlemen of a diſcreet behaviour came aboard to view our Ship, and diſcourſe our Captain. He was born in the Province of <hi>Baghia</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> whoſe Predeceſſors had reigned there 200 years. The Cauſe of his coming from home, was, that being accuſed of Treaſon, and tho innocent, yet could not make it appear,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93865:58"/>
and knowing the ſtrictneſs of the Law there, he petitioned the King that he would pleaſe to commit his Trial to Gods providence, and permit him to travel, with condition that if he brought not home ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Intelligence, the King had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard of, he ſhould die; the King gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſute, and he had been now 3 years at <hi>Tidore.</hi> He earneſtly entreated our General to declare unto him ſuch if he could, and likewiſe all occurrences happening in his long and dangerous Voyage; wherein our General ſatisfied him; he likewiſe informing our General of all things worth notice in their Country, withal entreating him to go along with him to <hi>China,</hi> but our General could not be perſuaded thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oct.</hi> 9. We ſet ſail thence, and conſidering our Ship needed reparation we determined to ſeek for a convenient place for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and <hi>Nov.</hi> 14. we arrived at an Iſland South of <hi>Celebes,</hi> in 1 deg. 40 min. South. Lat. which place being uninhabited gave us more encouragement; and ſo we anchored, and in diſpatching our buſineſs ſpent 26 days.</p>
            <p>The whole Iſland is overgrown with Wood; the Trees are large, high and ſtraight, the leaves whereof are like our Broom; among theſe Trees were a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93865:59"/>
of Worms (no bigger than Flies) which by night did caſt great light. There was here alſo a great number of Bats, of the Bigneſs of a Hen, with flie wonderfully ſwift, but their flight is ſhort, and when they light they hang by the Boughs with their Backs downwards. There was here likewiſe a Kind of Cray Fiſh, of ſuch ſize that one would ſatisfie 4 men, being very wholeſom Food. They do not live in the Sea, but dig themſelves caves under the roots of Trees, lodging by Companies; when we came to take them they climbed up Trees to hide themſelves. This Iſland we called <hi>Crab Iſland. Dec.</hi> 12. We put to Sea, and on the 16 had ſight of <hi>Celebes</hi> or <hi>Sillebis;</hi> but having a bad Wind, and being entangled with Iſlands, and other difficulties and dangers, we could not recover the North of <hi>Sillebis,</hi> or continue or courſe further Weſt, but were neceſſitated to ſteer Southwards, finding that courſe very dangerous by reaſon of the many Shoals; and <hi>Jan.</hi> 9. when we thought we were paſt all danger, and had a proſperous Gale of Wind, of a Sudden, when we were ſailing with full Sail, in the beginning of the firſt night Watch, our Ship was laid faſt on a deſperate Shoal; where we expected nothing but preſent death. Notwithſtanding having firſt recommended
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93865:59"/>
our ſelves to God by prayer, we endeavoured to uſe the means, and in the firſt place plying our Pumps, we found the leak nothing encreaſed, which was ſome, tho ſmall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to us. Our next Eſſay was for good ground and anchor-hold to Seaward of us, whereon to hale, by which means, if by any, our General told us there was ſome hope left; but when we ſounded, we found that even a Boats length from the Ship we could not find ground; ſo that our hopes quite vaniſhed, and nothing but preſent death, or at leaſt a lingring death was before us. In thoſe fears and perplexities we ſpent this night; next morning we tryed to ſee if we could now find any Anchor-hold, but this ſucceeded no better than the former. But it pleaſed God miraculouſly to deliver us, ſo that we got clear of it.</p>
            <p>This Shoal is 3024 Leagues in length, &amp; lyes in 1 deg. betwixt 56 and 57. min. South. Lat. This was the greateſt danger we met with in our whole Voyage. Yet we were toſſed with ſeveral ſtorms for 3 weeks after. <hi>Jan.</hi> 12. being not able to bear Sail, we dropt our Anchors upon a Shoal in 3 deg. 30 min. <hi>Jan.</hi> 14. We again anchored at an Iſland in 4 deg. 6 min. South. Lat. After this we had foul Weather, ſo that we were weary of the Coaſt of <hi>Celebes.</hi> The fartheſt Cape of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebes</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:93865:60"/>
is in 5 deg. South Lat. <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. We were forced to run with a ſmall Iſland not far thence, and ſought for a place where we might anchor; when ſuddenly a ſtorm aroſe out of the Southweſt, whereby we were in fear of being caſt away on a Lee ſhore; and had if the merciful Goodneſs of God had not wrought our delivery. Having eſcaped this danger we continued our courſe till 26 day, when, the winds ariſing, we could bear no ſail till <hi>Feb.</hi> 1. At which time we ſaw very high land, and would willingly have got in there, but that the weather was ſo bad. <hi>Feb.</hi> 3. We ſaw a little Iſland, but could not fetch it. <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. We ſaw 5 Iſlands, one to the Eaſt and 4 to the Weſt of us, at the biggeſt of which we anchored, and watred. <hi>Feb.</hi> 8. we departed thence, and deſcried 2 Canows, who having ſeen us before came willingly to us, conducting us to their Town, not far off named <hi>Baratina;</hi> it is in 7 deg. 13 min. South Lat.</p>
            <p>The People are Gentiles, of handſom Body, comely Stature, civil Demeanor, juſt in dealing and courteous to Strangers.

In 8 deg. 4 min. <hi>Feb.</hi> 12. we eſpied a green Land to the Southward, and a little after 2 Iſlands on the ſame ſide, and one more on the North, all which we paſt: <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. we ſaw other big Iſlands; and <hi>Feb.</hi> 15 paſt between 4 or 5 big Iſlands in 9 deg. 40 min. <hi>Feb.</hi> 18. we anchored in a little Iſland, and departed next day. <hi>Feb.</hi> 22. we loſt ſight of ſome Iſlands on our Star-Board ſide. After this we ſteered Weſtward, ſeeing nothing conſiderable, till <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. in the morning we eſpied Land, ſome part thereof very high, in 8 deg. 20. min. and bearing farther North, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. we anchored; we firſt took in Water, and afterwards ſent our Boat aſhore, and traffiqued with the People of the Country, and next day brought our Ship nearer the Town; our General ſent Linnen and Woollen Cloath, and ſome Silks as a Preſent for the King, in requital whereof he returned Rice, Cocoes, Hens, and other Victuals. This Iſland we found to be <hi>Java,</hi> the middle whereof is in 7 deg. 30 min. South Lat.

               <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. Our General with others went aſhore, and complemented the King with his Muſick, ſhewing him likewiſe the manner of our exerciſing Arms; we were cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly received, and diſmiſſed with promiſe of more ſupplies.</p>
            <p>In this Iſland there is one Chief but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Under-Governors, whom they call <hi>Raias,</hi> who live in great love. <hi>Marc.</hi> 14. we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Victuals from 2 of them, and on the 15. three of theſe petty Kings viſited our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who were highly ſatisfied with what they ſaw, and with our entertainment, and on their return related what they ſaw to <hi>Raia Donan</hi> the Chief King, who next day came aboard us, bringing Victuals with him for our relief. Few days paſt but one or more of theſe Kings viſited us, ſo that we were acquainted with moſt of them; and our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral always entertained them to the utmoſt of his Power; eſpecially with our Muſick wherewith they were extremely delighted.

along till <hi>June</hi> 15. and paſt the Cape within ſhot of it. <hi>July</hi> 15. we fell with Land again about <hi>Rio de Seſto.

            <p>We departed the 14. <hi>Sept.</hi> and being on that part of the Coaſt of Spain, called the <hi>Moors,</hi> we eſpied ſome Ships; The General ſent the Vice-Admiral to ſee what they were; they being <hi>Frenchmen</hi> bound homewards with Salt, on ſight thereof deſerted moſt of their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93865:63"/>
Ships, and our General having a fancy for one of them, called the <hi>Drake,</hi> took her along with him, but payed for her at his return: The reſt were diſmiſſed. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards putting off to Sea we met with more <hi>French</hi> Ships, returning with <hi>Newland</hi> Fiſh, whom our General, after ſpeech with them diſmiſſed, without doing them any hurt. The next day we deſcried another Ship of 240 Tun, and Mr. <hi>Carleil</hi> Lieut. Gen. took her; the Admiral coming up, the Maſter and principal Men of her were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined apart, and ſhe was found to belong to <hi>Spain,</hi> tho moſt of the Seamen belonged to St. <hi>John de Luce;</hi> This Ship was laden with <hi>Newland</hi> Fiſh, (we call it <hi>Poor John)</hi> which was diſtributed amongſt our Ships.</p>
            <p>Two days after we put in at the Iſles of <hi>Bayon,</hi> the winds croſſing us, and anchored. But the General ordered all the Pinnaces and Ship-Boats to be manned, and every man to be furniſhed with ſit Arms; which done, the General went into his Galley rowing towards the City of <hi>Bayon</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſurpriſe it; but we were met by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, ſent from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to diſcover us; after our General had ſpoke with him, he ſent Capt. <hi>Sampſon</hi> with him to the Governor, deſiring to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93865:63"/>
of 2 Points: To wit, whether there were Wars between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England?</hi> And, why our Merchants were arreſted. Our General with advice of the Lieut. Gen. purpoſed to get as near the City as they could, that upon Capt. <hi>Sampſons</hi> return, if need were, they might make a ſudden at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt before it were dark.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Sampſon</hi> returned with this anſwer, That the Governor ſaid he knew of no Wars; And as for the ſtay of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that it was the Kings pleaſure, but with no intent to injure them, and that afterwards by the Kings Order they were diſcharged, for confirmation of which he ſent ſuch Merchants as were in Town of our own Nation: Upon which it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, that night to land our Force. The Governor ſent us ſome refreſhment. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight a Storm ariſing, we went aboard, and before we reached our Fleet, ſeveral of our Ships were driven from their Anchor Holds, of which one was driven back to <hi>England,</hi> but all the reſt came up to us again. The Storm laſted three days, which being over our Lieut. Gen. was ſent with his and 3 other Ships to <hi>Vigo,</hi> where he took many Boats, and ſome Carvels, laden with things of ſmall Value, moſtly Houſehold Stuff, and among the reſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93865:64"/>
he found one Boat laden with the principal Church-Stuff of the High-Church of <hi>Vigo,</hi> where alſo was their great Croſs of Silver, of emboſſed Work, double gilt all over. All we had in this place amounted to 30000 Duckets. The next day the whole Fleet went up to a Harbor above <hi>Vigo,</hi> where the Lieut. Gen. ſtayed our coming. In the mean time the Governor of <hi>Galiſia</hi> had raiſed 2000 Foot, and 300 Horſe, and marched from <hi>Bayon</hi> to this place, and ſent to parly with our General, which was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; at their meeting it was agreed, that we ſhould have Water and other Neceſſaries, paying for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Afterwards we departed for the <hi>Canaries;</hi> and fell with <hi>Palma</hi> with purpoſe to have landed there, but by reaſon of the many Guns, that were planted there, which were diſcharged upon us, and other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, we were forced to alter our Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and determined to land in the Iſle of <hi>Ferro;</hi> and when we had landed 1000 Men there, and ſtayed two days, the Inhabitants accompanyed with an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> came to us, declaring their State to be ſo poor, that they were ready to ſtarve; which was not untrue; and therefore that night we put to Sea again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:93865:64"/>
               <hi>Nov.</hi> 13. We fell with Cape <hi>Blancke,</hi> and put into the Bay, where were ſome <hi>French</hi> Men of War, whom we entertained cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and afterward departed to the Iſles of Cape <hi>Verde,</hi> and <hi>Nov.</hi> 16. we ſaw the Iſland of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> and in the Evening anchored the Fleet between <hi>Plaie</hi> or <hi>Prdie</hi> and St. <hi>Jago,</hi> and landed 1000 Men under the leading of the Lieut. General, who kept us marching till we came to a convenient Plain, and when we were all gathered there, he thought it beſt to make no attempt till day; after we had taken a little reſpite, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Army into three Parts. By that time we were well ranged daylight appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and having advanced hard by the Wall, and ſeeing no Enemy to reſiſt, the Lieut. Gen. ordered Capt. <hi>Sampſon</hi> and Capt. <hi>Barton</hi> with 30 ſhot apiece, to enter the Town, which ſtood in the Valley under us, and after them was ſent <hi>St. Georges</hi> Croſs to be placed towards the Sea, to give advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our Fleet; and that day, being <hi>Nov.</hi> 17. all the great Ordnance about the Town, being above 50 Pieces was ſhot off in honour of our Queens Coronation day. In the mean while the Lieut. Gen. ſtayed upon the Hill with moſt of his Forces till the Town was quartered out for lodging the Army, which done every Captain took his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93865:65"/>
own Quarter, and in the evening kept ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Guard to prevent danger. Here we ſtayed 14 days taking ſuch ſpoils as the place afforded, but found no Treaſure.</p>
            <p>The Situation of <hi>St. Jago</hi> is in Form like to a Triangle, having on the Eaſt and Weſt ſides 2 Rocky Mountains, on the top of which were built ſome Fortifications; one the South ſide is the Main Sea, and on the North a Valley between the aforeſaid Mountains, the Valley and Town grow very narrow between the 2 Clifts. In the midſt of the Valley cometh down a Brook of freſh Water, which hard by the Sea maketh a Pond very convenient for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering. The Valley at the Towns End is wholly converted into Gardens, and Orchards, wherein are diverſe ſorts of Herbs, Fruits and Trees, among which are the Cocoes and Plantens; The Cocoes have a hard ſhell and green Husk over it, bigger than a mans 2 Fiſts; of the ſhell drinking Cups are made, within this ſhell is a white Rine reſembling the White of an Egg when it is hard boyled, and within that a Water whitiſh and clear, about a half Pint, which are very cool, and as ſome ſay reſtorative. The Planten groweth in Cods like to Beans, but bigger, and when it is ripe, the meat of it becometh yellow, and is very pleaſant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:93865:65"/>
While we abode here a <hi>Portugal</hi> came hither with a Flag of Truce, to whom Capt. <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Goring</hi> were ſent; as they came to him, he asked of what Nation they were, and being told, he asked if there were Wars between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> they anſwered, our General could beſt ſatisfie him in that, and proffered him ſafe conduct if he would go to him; but he refuſed, pretending he was not ſent by his Governor. Then they told him, that if his Governor would conſult his own or his Countreys good, his beſt courſe were to preſent himſelf to our General, Sir <hi>Fancis Drake,</hi> whereby he might aſſuredly find favour, otherwiſe within 3 days we would march over the Land, and proſecute them with Fire and Sword.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nov.</hi> 24. The Gen. Lieut. Gen. with 600 Men marched to <hi>Sancto Domingo,</hi> a Village 12 Miles within the Land, where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, Biſhop, and better ſort lodged but found it abandoned.</p>
            <p>After we had ſtayed a while, we marched homewards; as we were on our way, we ſaw the Enemy both Horſe and Foot, though not of ſuch Force as to encounter us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nov.</hi> 26. Our General ordered the Army to be embarqued into their Ships, and Capt. <hi>Goring</hi> and Lieut. <hi>Tucker,</hi> with 100 Foot
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93865:66"/>
were ordered to make a ſtand in the Market place, till our Forces were all embarqued, the Vice-Admiral waiting to take them aboard. And alſo our General ordered Capt. <hi>Sampſon</hi> with a Party to ſeek out ſuch Munition as was hidden in the ground at the Town of <hi>Praie,</hi> having been promiſed to be ſhewed it by a Priſoner taken the day before. When they came thither, the Priſoner failed of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and they ſearching all ſuſpected places, found a Piece of Ordnance of Iron, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of Braſs. In the afternoon our General anchored the Fleet before <hi>Praie,</hi> and went aſhore, and cauſed us burn the Town, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards embarqued the ſame night, and put off to Sea Southweſt.</p>
            <p>Before our departure from St. <hi>Jago</hi> the Gen. adminiſtred the Oath of Supremacy to the Souldiers, as alſo an Oath for every man to do his utmoſt for the ſervice of the Action, and to obey the Orders of the Gen. and his Officers.</p>
            <p>All the time of our being here none of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came near us: the cauſe of which, we conjecture, was the freſh remembrance of Injuries they had done ſome of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, by reaſon whereof we left tokens of our diſcontent.</p>
            <p>From hence we put over to the Weſt<hi>-Indies,</hi> and in our way were afflicted with a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93865:66"/>
grievous diſtemper, whereof above 300 died in a few days: This ſickneſs ſeiſed our People, with extream heat and a burning Ague; and thoſe that eſcaped, ſuffered a great diminution in their ſtrength and wits. In 18 days ſpace we had ſight of the Iſland of <hi>Dominica,</hi> which is inhabited by a ſavage People, who go all naked, their Skin is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured with paint of a reddiſh Tawney; perſonable and ſtrong men; they admit little converſe with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> yet they uſed us very kindly, helping us with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; they brought us ſtore of Tobacco, as alſo a kind of Bread, called <hi>Caſſado,</hi> very white and ſavory, made of the Roots of <hi>Caſſania;</hi> for which we gave them Glaſs, coloured Beads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>From hence we went to the Weſtwards of St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> Iſland, where we ſpent ſome days of <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> but could ſee no Inhabitants. Here it was unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, to proceed to <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> And by the way we met a ſmall Frigat, bound thither, which we took, and having exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the Men, one of them informed us, that it was a barren Haven, and the Land well fortified with a Caſtle, ſo that we could not land within 10 Miles of the City; to which place he promiſed to conduct us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:93865:67"/>
Hereupon we went on all this night in our Voyage, and the General put himſelf into the Bark <hi>Francis,</hi> as Admiral, and in the Morning, we came to the aforeſaid place, 10 Miles Weſtward of <hi>Domingo.</hi> When we were landed, our General returned to his Fleet, committing the Charge of us to the Lieut. Gen. We marched at 8 a Clock, and at Noon we approached the Town, where thoſe of the better ſort, about 150 Horſe, began to preſent themſelves, but we ſo played upon them with our ſmall ſhot, that they ſoon retreated, ſo that we had leave to proceed towards the two Gates of the Town, that were next the Sea. They had manned them both, and planted their Ordnance, and alſo ſome Troops of ſmall ſhot in <hi>Ambuſcado</hi> by the way ſide. We di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided our whole Force, being 1200, to attack both the Gates.</p>
            <p>Their Ordnance was no ſooner diſcharged on us, doing but ſmall execution, but our Lieut. Gen. advanced with all ſpeed, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their recharging, and notwithſtanding their <hi>Ambuſcadoes,</hi> we quickly entred the Gates, and forthwith repaired to a ſpacious Square before the great Church; whither alſo came Capt. <hi>Powel</hi> with the other Party. This place we fortified and ſtayed here all day. After Midnight they that were in the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93865:67"/>
Caſtle hearing us at the Gates, forſook it, ſome flying others taken Priſoners.</p>
            <p>Next day we quartered through the Town, and kept this Town a Month. One day as we ſtayed here, the Gen. ſent on Meſſage to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a <hi>Negroe</hi> Boy, with a Flag of White; this Boy meeting unhappily with ſome <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they ſtruck him through the Body with one of the Horſemen ſtaves; the Boy notwithſtanding returned to our General, and after he had declared it to him, died forthwith in his preſence. Whereat our General was ſo incenſed, that he cauſed two Friars, then Priſoners, to be led out to the ſame place and hanged, and alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht a Meſſenger to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that unleſs the Party who had killed the Boy were delivered up, every day 2 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſhould be hanged ſo long as any were left. Whereupon the day following, he was brought to the Towns End to be delivered up, but our General ordered them to diſpatch him: which they did.</p>
            <p>During our abode here many Treaties paſt between them and us for Ranſom of their City, but upon diſagreement, all the morning we fired the outmoſt houſes, which was hard to perform, they being ſtrong ſtone Houſes; and tho for 14 days 20 Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners ſpent the whole forenoon in firing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93865:68"/>
Houſes, yet not one third part of the Town was conſumed, ſo that in end being weary of this, we were content to accept of 25000 Duckets (5 ſ. 6. d. <hi>per</hi> Ducket) as a Ranſom for the reſt of the Town. I cannot omit the relation of a notable inſtance of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable ambition of the <hi>Spaniſh King:</hi> As we entred his Houſe there, over againſt us we ſpied a large Scutcheon, the Kings Arms; in the lower part thereof is deſcribed the Globe of the Earth, and a Horſe ſtanding, his hinder part within the Globe, and his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part without, lifting up as it were to leap, with this Motto: <hi>Non ſufficit Orbis, The World is not enough.</hi> Which ſome of the wiſer <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when they were treating with us, were even aſhamed of.</p>
            <p>Now tho this is naturally a rich Place yet we had no Treaſure here. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Indians</hi> were long ago conſumed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Tyranny, and for lack of People to work, the Golden and Silver Mines are quite given over, inſtead thereof uſing Copper. Their Chief Trade con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of Sugar, Ginger, and Hides of Oxen and Kine, bred here in infinite Numbers and of vaſt bigneſs. Here alſo we had Plenty of ſtrong Wine, ſweet Oyl, Vinegar, Olives, Excellent Wheat Meal packed up in Wine Pipes, Woollen and Linnen Cloath, Silks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:93865:68"/>
all which were brought out of <hi>Spain.</hi> We found but little Plate, becauſe they uſe much <hi>China</hi> Wair.</p>
            <p>Hence we put over to the <hi>Main</hi> Land, and came in ſight of <hi>Cartagena,</hi> ſtanding hard by the Sea. The Harbor Mouth lyes 3 Miles Weſtward from the Town, which we entred about 3 a Clock in the Afternoon. In the Evening we landed near the Harbor Mouth, under the Leading of our Lieut. Gen. and afterwards about Midnight mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forwards eaſily, keeping cloſe by the Sea ſide. But as we came within 2 Miles of the Town, their Horſemen met us, and taking the Alarm, retired upon the firſt Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of our ſhot.</p>
            <p>At this time we heard ſome Pieces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery diſcharged, with ſmall ſhot towards the Harbor, whereby we underſtood, that, according to our Generals order the Night before, the Vice-Admiral, with Captain <hi>Venner,</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> and <hi>Craſs</hi> &amp;c. with Boats and Pinnaces did attacque the little Fort on the Entry of the inner Haven, though to ſmall purpoſe. In which attempt the Vice-Admiral had the Rudder of his Skiff ſhot through.</p>
            <p>The Troops being now in their March half a Mile this ſide the Town, the Ground grew ſtreight having the Main Sea on one
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93865:69"/>
ſide, and the Harbour on the other. This ſtreight was fortifyed with a ſtone Wall, and Ditch. There was only ſo much unwalled, as might ſerve for paſſage, and that was well Barricado'd. This Wall had 6 great Pieces planted on it, which ſhot directly on our Front. On the inner ſide of the Streight, they had brought 2 Gallies to the Shore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they placed 11 Pieces of Ordnance and 400 ſmall ſhot, which Flanked our coming on, and on the Land ſide in the Guard only of this place 300 ſhot and Pikes. They diſcharged many ſhot both great and ſmall, but our Lieut. Gen. approached by the loweſt ground, ſo that moſt of their ſhot was in vain; he alſo forbid us to ſhoot till we were come to the Wall ſide. The firſt place we came to was the Barricado's, where we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged our ſhot juſt on our Enemies Faces, and joyned with them, and made them quickly retire; Our Lieut. Gen. ſlew the Chief Enſign Bearer of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> We followed them into the Town, and won the Mercate place. At every Streets End they had made Barricado's, but we quickly took them with ſmall loſs. They had ſet <hi>Indians</hi> in ſeveral corners with poyſoned Arrows; they had alſo ſtuck ſmall ſticks ſharply poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and poyſoned, in the ground in our way; but we coming cloſe by the ſhore ſhunned moſt of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:93865:69"/>
We ſtayed here 6 Weeks, and the Sickneſs aforeſaid ſtill continued; Few eſcaping, and thoſe that did eſcape, ſcarce ever recovered their ſtrength, or their wits; ſo that when any ſpoke fooliſhly, it was uſual to ſay he had been ſick of a Calenture; The cauſe of it was ſuppoſed to be the Evening Air (they term it <hi>La Serena)</hi> which they ſay produces this diſtemper to any then abroad who is not a Native. By reaſon hereof we gave over our deſign for <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> where all the Treaſure was, and thought of returning home.</p>
            <p>While we were here one day our Watch eſpied 2 ſmall Barks at Sea making towards the Harbor; Whereupon Capt. <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Varney</hi> with others embarqued themſelves in 2 Pinnaces; that they might take them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they knew of our being there; but they having notice of it ran themſelves aſhore, and the men hid themſelves in Buſhes: Our men immediatly boarded them, and were ſuddenly ſhot at by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the Buſhes; whereby Capt. <hi>Varney</hi> died preſently, and Capt. <hi>Moon</hi> died of his Wounds ſome days after; and ſo we returned diſappointed, having had but few men, far inferior to them in Number.</p>
            <p>In this time diverſe Courteſies paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and us, and among
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93865:70"/>
others, the Governor, and Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagena</hi> with others came to viſit our General.</p>
            <p>We began to fire this City as we had done others, but at laſt they ranſomed it for 110000 Duckets. A far greater Ranſom than <hi>Domingo,</hi> becauſe it is a Place of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Traffique (whereas the other is chiefly inhabited by Lawyers and Gentlemen, being the chiefeſt Court of Judicature of the Iſlands about it.) Yet having warning of our coming they had carried away their Treaſure and principal Subſtance. The Ranſom aforeſaid being only mentioned for the Town, on payment thereof we left it, and drew part of our Souldiers into the Abby a quarter of a Mile below the Town, on the Harbor. Whereupon they offered us a Ranſom for the Abby and the Caſtle on the Mouth of the Harbor; and when we asked alike for both; they proffered us 1000 Crowns for the Abby, and to diſpoſe of the Caſtle as we pleaſed; and therefore we delivered them the Abby, and blew up the Caſtle, and ſo departed to our Ships, which in the mean while were making all preparations for their Voyage. This Iſland is very fruitful, bearing many pleaſant Fruits; it is but 2 or 3 Miles about. After 6 Weeks ſtay here we put to Sea, and 2 or 3 days after our Ship we had taken at <hi>St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo,</hi> fell into a great leak, and loſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93865:70"/>
of us; but next Morning our General miſſing her caſt about, and at laſt found her in great diſtreſs: whereupon we returned to <hi>Cartagena,</hi> where ſhe was unladed, and her Goods and Men diſpoſed in other Ships: after which we departed, and arrived at Cape St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and finding no Water there, we put to Sea; but were forced to return; and then our ſcarcity of Water being greater we were more diligent in ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and had it in abundance: In taking in of which our General wrought as hard as the meaneſt of his Company, to his unſpeakable Praiſe. After 3 days we departed, and touched no where, but coaſted along <hi>Florida,</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 28. we ſaw a place, on the Shore built like a Beacon in 30 deg. We manned our Pinnaces, and went aſhore, and marched up the River ſide, to ſee what place the Enemy held, our General marched with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, the Lieut. Gen. led the Vantguard, and when we had gone a Mile, we ſaw a Fort on the other ſide the River, built by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and a little Town without Walls 3 Miles above it. We prepared Ordnance for the Battery, and about Evening our Lieut. Gen. ſhot off a Piece, which ſtroke through their Enſign. In the Night the Lieut. Gen. took a little Rowing Skiff, and 12 men well Armed, as Capt. <hi>Morgan, Sampſon,</hi> and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93865:71"/>
others, to view what Guard the Enemy kept; the Enemy ſeeng him come, took the Alarm, and being fearful, that all our Force was coming, abandoned the Place when they had ſhot off ſome Pieces. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a <hi>Frenchman</hi> (a Priſoner) informed us; Thereupon our Gen. and Lieut. Gen. with ſome Souldiers, put over to the Fort. In our approach ſome that ſtayed behind ſhot off 2 Pieces; yet we entred, finding no man there. We found here 14 great Pieces of Braſs Ordnance, and of Money to the Value of 2000 l. Next day we eſſayed to go to the Town, but could not by reaſon of Rivers and broken ground, and therefore were forced to go up the River in our Pinnaces. When we approached the Land, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged ſome ſhot on us, and preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew. And the Serjeant Major finding one of their Horſes ready, mounted, and followed the Chaſe, and outrunning his Company he was ſhot through the Head, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſtabbed in ſeveral parts of his Body by others, to our great Grief. In this Place, called St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> the King kept 150 Souldiers, and at St. <hi>Helena,</hi> 12 Miles Northward the ſame number, to keep other Nations from inhabiting any part of that Coaſt. Here it was reſolved to aſſault St. <hi>Helena,</hi> and then to ſeek out our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93865:71"/>
in <hi>Virginia,</hi> in their Plantation diſtant thence 6 deg. Northwards. But when we came by St. <hi>Helena,</hi> the Shoals appearing dangerous, and we having no Pilot that would undertake to guide us, durſt not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard in, but coaſted along, and <hi>June 9th.</hi> on ſight of a great Fire, the General ſent his Skiff to the ſhore, where they found ſome <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and brought them aboard, who directed us to their Port. But ſome of our Ships being of great draught, we anchored all two Miles from the ſhore. Our General wrote to Mr. <hi>Ralph Lane</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, ſhewing how ready he was to ſupply their Neceſſities. Next day Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> with others coming to him, our Capt. proffered either to leave a Ship, a Pinnace, and ſome Boats, with ſufficient Maſters and Mariners, with a Months Victuals to ſtay and make further diſcovery of the Country, and ſo much, as would bring them into <hi>England</hi> after ſuch time, if they thought fit; Or if they deſired to return into <hi>England</hi> now, he would give them Paſſage; they accepted the former. Whereupon the Ship being received into Charge by ſome of their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, before they had received their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion a ſtorm aroſe, and continued 3 days, which put all our Fleet in diſorder, beſides the loſs of Anchors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that Ship was
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93865:72"/>
driven quite away, and never ſaw us again till we came to <hi>England,</hi> with ſeveral other loſſes Notwithſtanding our General pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffered them another Ship, tho not ſo good as the other, nor the ſame Proviſion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> requeſted our General, that they might have paſſage for <hi>England;</hi> which being granted, and the reſt ſent for out of the Country, and ſhipped, we depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Coaſt <hi>June</hi> 18. and arrived ſafely at <hi>Plimouth, July</hi> 28. 1586.</p>
            <p>The total Value of what we got in this Voyage was 60000 <hi>l.</hi> whereof the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that travelled in the Voyage were to have 20000 <hi>l.</hi> the Adventurers the other 40000.</p>

               <hi>Sept.</hi> 9. We eſpied 20 <hi>French</hi> Men of War, who chaſed us, but could not fetch us up, and therefore left us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 25. We deſcried 2 Iſlands, <hi>Hamſeroth,</hi> and <hi>Forta-Fontura,</hi> both ſtanding W. and by S. in 28 deg. diſtant one from the other, 4 or 5 Leagues, and from the Grand <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi> 10 Leagues.</p>

Lives, we went but 9 Miles, and could get no farther, being ſtopt by a Fort the Enemy had on the Top of a Rock through which we behoved to march; the Paſſage was ſo narrow that but one man at once could go up, ſo that we were forced to retire with loſs. Several both Commanders and Soldiers were hurt. Returning to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> we ſaw it all on Fire, and thereupon haſted to our Ships.

            <p>The Charge of her Navy ſhe committed to <hi>Charles Howard</hi> of <hi>Effingam</hi> Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>England:</hi> Her Vice-Admiral was the Famous Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> who were ſent to the Weſt of <hi>England.</hi> She appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Seimour,</hi> ſecond Son to the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> to lye upon the Coaſts of <hi>Flanders</hi> with 40 Ships, to prevent the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s joyning his ſtrength with the <hi>Armado.</hi> She ordered the Land-forces to be muſtered, appointing <hi>Duilley</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Lieut. 20000. whereof were diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed along the South Coaſt.

And in caſe they ſhould land, that they

ſhould lay all the Countrey about Waſte, that the Enemy might have no Food but what they brought from their Ships, and that they ſhould continually buſy the Enemy with Alarms, but not hazard a Battle till greater Force were got together.</p>
            <p>Some alſo ſuggeſted that the Papiſts at home were more to be feared than the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> abroad; whereupon ſome of them were impriſoned. Directions alſo were ſent to the Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> how to demean himſelf in this imminent danger.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe Preparations, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to caſt a miſt over her Majeſties Eyes, importuned for a Peace, and at laſt prevailed ſo far, that a Treaty of Peace was entred upon, our Queen notwithſtanding Reſolving to treat with her Sword in her Hand.

            <p>This <hi>Armado,</hi> which had the Popes ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Bleſſing, in token of its holy Warfare,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93865:80"/>

            </p>
            <p>About the ſame time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, in all about 100 Ships, whereof 15 were Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallers and 9 Voluntiers of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Gentlemen, hearing that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ready to ſail, ſet forth of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to meet and fight them by the way, but before they reached the <hi>Syllies,</hi> they were driven back by tempeſt to <hi>Plimouth;</hi> only ſome of their Scouts deſcried ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, that were diſperſed.</p>
            <p>News being brought that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were in diſtreſs, the Lord Admiral <hi>Howard</hi> taking advantage of the firſt fair Wind, lanched forth, <hi>July 8th,</hi> and bore his Sails almoſt within ſight of the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> purpoſing to ſurprize their Ships; but the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93865:80"/>
Wind ſuddenly turning South, and he, wiſely foreſeeing the diſadvantages of his ſtaying there, returned to <hi>Plimouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time it was confidently report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet could not ſet forth that Year: and our Queen was ſo confident thereof, that ſhe ordered 4 of her biggeſt Ships to be brought to <hi>Chatham:</hi> but our Admiral foreſeeing the hazard of it, wiſely retarded it; which was a ſingular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet entred the <hi>Channel, July 11th,</hi> where Anchoring, they ſent to the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to ſignifie their Arrival, and require him in the Kings name to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Charge for that ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 20. At noon they were deſcried by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which was a ſurprizal to them, moſt of their Men being aſhore. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs our undaunted Admiral towed forth ſuch Ships as he could get in readineſs into the Sea. When they were got out, they ſaw the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Ships with lofty Towers, in Front like a half Moon: they ſeemed to make for <hi>Plimouth,</hi> but yet ſteered their courſe by towards <hi>Calice,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to paſs by, that they might chaſe them in the Rear with a fore-right Wind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 21. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him a Pinnace to denounce War by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging her Ordnance; himſelf following
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93865:81"/>
in the <hi>Ark Royal</hi> ſet upon (the Admiral he thought, but) <hi>Alonzo de Leva</hi>'s Ship, where they had a fierce Encounter. Soon after <hi>Drake, Hawkins,</hi> and <hi>Forbuſher</hi> came up, playing with their Ordnance on the hindmoſt Squadron of the Enemies, commanded by <hi>Rechalde,</hi> who did all he could to ſtay his Men from flying, till his own Ship bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with ſhot with difficulty was drawn into the Main Fleet. At which time the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> gathered together his Fleet, and kept on his intended courſe towards <hi>Callice,</hi> and cauſed them to gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up cloſe in form of a half Moon. But our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral having maintained a hot fight for 2 hours, thought it beſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the purſuit, there being not above 30 of their Ships come up yet. In this fight the <hi>Katharine</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship, being ſorely battered, was taken into the midſt of the Fleet to be repaired; And an huge Ship <hi>Biſcaie</hi> of <hi>Don Oquendo</hi>'s, in which was a great part of the Kings Treaſure, was fired by a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Gunner, for being miſuſed by them; but the Fire was quickly quenched. All this while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> declined fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, walling in the reſt with their ſtrongeſt Ships, in which poſture they made a flying March towards <hi>Calice:</hi> and a great Gallion, wherein was <hi>Don Pedro de Valdez, Vaſquez</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:93865:81"/>
               <hi>de Silva, Alenzo de Saias,</hi> and other Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being battered with <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhot, in avoiding it fell foul of another Ship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe loſt her Fore-maſt, and could not keep up with the reſt, and was caſt behind. But night coming on, our Admiral paſt her, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing there was nothing left in her, and fearing to loſe ſight of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he followed the Lanthorn of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which he thought was carried, as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, by Sir <hi>Francis Drake;</hi> but he was purſuing 2 Ships he thought <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> but when he came up to them, he found they were Friends, and ſo diſmiſſed them. Yet by this miſtake of his the greateſt part of the Fleet wanting his light was forced to lye ſtill ſo that he and the reſt could not fetch up our Admiral till next day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July 22th</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> eſpied the aforeſaid Gallion, and ſent forth a Pinnace to command them to yield: <hi>Valdez</hi> anſwered that they were 430, and himſelf was <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and ſtood on his honour: the other replyed if he did not yield forthwith, he ſhould know <hi>Drake</hi> was no <hi>Daſtard; Pedro</hi> hearing that it was Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly yielded himſelf, and coming aboard Sir <hi>Francis</hi> Ship proteſted, they would have died, before they had yielded to any ſave him, whom <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> alwaies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93865:82"/>
and whoſe civility to the Conquered had often been experienced. Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to requite his Complements, placed him at his own Table, and lodged him in his own Cabine; the reſt he ſent to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where they remained Priſoners till their Ranſom was paid. The ſame day <hi>Michael de Oquendo</hi> Vice-Admiral of the Fleet, his Ship was on Fire, the upper part of it being burnt; but the Gunpowder in the hold not taking Fire, the Ship fell into the Hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and was carried in to <hi>Plimouth.</hi> All this day the Admiral ſpent in ſetting his Fleet in order, appointing every Ship his Station, commanding them, on pain of Death not to deſert it, and ſent one to the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to acquaint him with his Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 23. early the <hi>Spaniards</hi> taking the benefit of a Northerly Wind turned about againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being nimbler than they turned Weſtwards, and quickly recovered the Wind of them, and all that day battered thoſe Wooden Caſtles: The fight was variable, whilſt on the one ſide the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bravely reſcued the <hi>London</hi> Ships, and on the other the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> as ſtoutly delivered <hi>Richalde;</hi> moſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſhot flew over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> without hurting them, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> never diſcharged a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93865:82"/>
ſhot on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> but did Execution. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral would not hazard a fight by grappling with them, as ſome had adviſed, knowing they had a ſtrong Army in the Fleet, beſides the ſtrength of their Ships, which could not but at extreme diſadvantage be boarded. This day beſides other remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable loſſes the Enemy ſuſtained, a great <hi>Venetian</hi> Ship with other Smaller were taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gathered themſelves into a round, their greateſt Ships ſtanding outmoſt to guard the battered Ships.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July 24th,</hi> the 4 great Galliaſſes fought with ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, who galled the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with their ſhot: But our Men wanting Powder, the Admiral ſent ſome Ships to fetch ſupply. In the mean while it was ordered by a Council of War that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet ſhould be divided into 4 Squadrons, and the Admiral was Chief, Sir <hi>Fracnis Drake</hi> led the <hi>2d,</hi> Capt. <hi>Hawkins</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Forbuſher</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>July 25th,</hi> at the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> there was a ſharp Encounter. The St. <hi>Ann,</hi> a <hi>Portugal</hi> Gallion was ſet upon by ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, to whoſe reſcue came 3 Galliaſſes, which the Admiral and Lord <hi>Tho. Howard</hi> charged ſo that they could ſcarce ſave her. It was reported, that this day the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:93865:83"/>
Admiral was grievouſly rent with great Ordnance, and had been near taken, had not 2 Ships come up to her; after whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſet upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral, but ſhe made her eſcape. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral ſent again to the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to joyn his Fleet with them, and ſend them ſupply.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 26. the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral to encourage his Captains beſtowed the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, on ſeveral that had behaved themſelves courageouſly; And it was reſolved by all, that they would no more aſſail the Enemy till they came to the Strait of <hi>Calice,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Henry Seimour</hi> with his Ships waited their coming. And ſo far was this <hi>Armado</hi> from terrifying the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts, that, they hired Ships from all parts on their own Charges, and came to our ſupply; of whom were, the Earl of <hi>Oxford, Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Cumberland,</hi> with ſeveral other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 27. the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet ſetting forward, anchored before <hi>Calice,</hi> intending to joyn with the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Forces at <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> followed hard upon them, and caſt Anchor within <hi>Culvering</hi> ſhot of them, conſiſting now of 140 Sail, the Lord <hi>Hen. Seimour,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Winter</hi> having joyned them. From hence once more the D. of <hi>Medina</hi> ſent to the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93865:83"/>
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nobility went aſhore, among whom was the Prince of <hi>Aſcoli</hi> the Kings Baſe Son who returned no more; his Ship was afterwards caſt away on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Coaſt. The Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> being by them perſuaded, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had the better, conceived great hopes of his future Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet his joy was but ſhort, for the next Evening he had news of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> bad ſucceſs. And indeed he could not in that Juncture aſſiſt them; for his Boats leaked, his Proviſions failed, and his Seamen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from him: as alſo he could not get out by reaſon of a conſiderable Fleet of <hi>Dutch</hi> well furniſhed, that lay before <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Newport.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Lord Admiral to take 8 of his worſt Ships, and fill them with Combuſtible matter, and to charge their Guns with Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Stones, Chains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done; and on <hi>Sunday July</hi> 28. at 2 a Clock in the Morning they were let drive amongſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under the Guidance of <hi>Yong</hi> and <hi>Prowſe;</hi> who having fired their Trains and returned, ſuch a ſudden Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclap was given that the Poor <hi>Spaniards</hi> were wonderfully amazed: and to avoid this danger had no other Remedy, but to cut their Cables and drive at Random, where they
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93865:84"/>
had ſeveral Diſaſters, ſome of them fell foul upon another, others ran aground on the Sands, and ſome of them fell into the <hi>Engliſh</hi>'s Hands.</p>
            <p>In this ſurprizal the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the whole Fleet to weigh Anchor to avoid the danger, which done, to return to their Station; and he accordingly gave a ſignal to the reſt to do it by diſcharging his great Guns; but in this Conſternation the Warning was heard but by a few, the reſt being ſcattered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 29. After this diſaſter, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the beſt order they could came over againſt <hi>Graveling,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> deprived them of the conveniency of <hi>Calice Road,</hi> and kept them from ſupply out of <hi>Dunkirk:</hi> And <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Fenner</hi> inceſſantly diſcharged their Guns on them, as alſo the Lord Admiral and others: On the other hand the Duke of <hi>Medina, Leva,</hi> &amp;c. at laſt got clear of the Shallows, yet moſt of their Ships were piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully torn and ſhot through, beſides ſeveral that were ſunk. The Gallion St. <hi>Matthew</hi> coming to reſcue the St. <hi>Philip</hi> was together with the other miſerably torn with ſhot by <hi>Seimour</hi> and <hi>Winter;</hi> and afterwards driven near <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and at laſt taken by the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franciſco de Toledo,</hi> a Colonel over 32 Bands, his Ship proved ſo leaky, that he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93865:84"/>
with ſome others left her; the Ship afterwards was taken by the <hi>Fluſhingers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſappointed of their brave Deſigns, were now content to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Wind turning S. W. they paſſed <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> following them cloſe. And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral diſpatched the Lord <hi>Henry Seimour</hi> to the Coaſt of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to ſtop the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s coming out, and to joyn with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 31. early, the N. W. Wind blew hard, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> laboured to recover the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Strait, but were driven towards <hi>Zealand.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave off the Chaſe, as ſeeing them near Ruin. But the Wind turning S. W. and by W. they got clear of the Shallows, and that Evening called a Council, wherein it was reſolved to return into <hi>Spain</hi> by the Northern Paſſage. And thereupon they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their Courſe Northward, and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> followed them to prevent their landing in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Yet moſt thought they would return again; whereupon our Queen with a Maſculine Courage, viewed her Army at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> and walking through the Ranks with a Truncheon in her Hand, wonderfully encouraged all of them. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> betook themſelves to an abſolute Flight, and bended their Courſe towards <hi>Norway;</hi> and being now freed of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> conſulted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93865:85"/>
what to do: they were tender of the Popes credit, feared the wrath of King <hi>Philip;</hi> that the Glory of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would be laid in the Duſt; The Invincible <hi>Armado</hi> became a Scorn, if they returned ſo into <hi>Spain.</hi> On the other hand they conſidered, that 5000 Souldiers were ſlain; many maimed; 12 of their greateſt Ships ſunk, loſt, or taken; their Cables, Maſts or Sails, cut, rent and broken; their Proviſions failing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which things conſidered, they concluded to go quickly to <hi>Spain.</hi> And knowing that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> would not ſupply them, nor the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> they caſt all their Horſes and Mules over Board, to ſpare their freſh Water. And ſo ſteering their Courſe to ſail about <hi>Cathenes,</hi> and the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they ſteered between the <hi>Orcades</hi> and the Iſles of <hi>Farr</hi> unto 61. deg. North. Lat. from whence the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> with his beſt ſtored Ships, took Weſtwards over the Main towards <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and at laſt arrived in <hi>Spain:</hi> where he was depoſed from all his Authority, diſcharged the Court, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to live private.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Ships being 40, fell nearer with the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where many of them were caſt away, ſuch as eſcaped there, ſome of them were driven into the Channel, where ſome of them were taken by the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93865:85"/>
               <hi>Engliſh,</hi> others by <hi>Rochel</hi> men, and ſome of them arrived at <hi>New-Haven</hi> in <hi>Normandy:</hi> So that of 134 Ships that ſet Sail out of <hi>Lisbon</hi> only 53 returned into <hi>Spain:</hi> of the 4 Galliaſſes of <hi>Naples</hi> but one: of the 4 Gallions of <hi>Portugal</hi> but one: of the 91 Gallions and great Hulks from diverſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces but 33. In ſhort, they loſt in this Voyage 81 Veſſels, 13500 Souldiers, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners taken above 2000: In <hi>England</hi> were taken, <hi>Don Pedro de Valdez, Don Vaſquez de Silva,</hi> and <hi>Don Alonzo de Saies,</hi> and others; In <hi>Ireland Don Alonzo de Luzon,</hi> and <hi>Roderigo de Leſſe,</hi> and others; In <hi>Zeland</hi> was <hi>Don Diego Piementelli:</hi> Yea, there was not a Noble Family in <hi>Spain,</hi> but in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition loſt a Son, Brother, or Kinſman.</p>
            <p>In the aftermentioned Wracks above 700 Souldiers and Sailers were caſt aſhore on <hi>Scotland,</hi> who on Interceſſion of the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> were after a Years time ſent over into <hi>Flanders:</hi> But more unmercifully were thoſe Dealt with who were driven into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> ſome of them being put to death by their old Friends, the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> others by the Command of the Lord Deputy, who feared leſt they might joyn with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Peace of the Nation. The Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being terrified therewith committed themſelves to Sea in their ſhattered Veſſels,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93865:86"/>
and were many of them ſwallowed up by the Waves.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> lying one Night in her Army at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burley</hi> came thither, and delivered to the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> the Examination of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who was taken and brought into <hi>England</hi> by Sir <hi>Francis Drake;</hi> which Examination (ſaith Dr. <hi>Sharp)</hi> was thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Pedro</hi> being asked by ſome Lords of Council, what was the Intent of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? anſwered, What, but to ſubdue your Nation, and root it out? What (ſaid the Lords) meant you then to do with the Catholicks? We meant (ſaid he) to have ſent them (good Men) directly to Heaven, as you that are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks to Hell. But (ſaid the Lords) what meant you to do with your Whips of Cords and Wire, you have ſuch ſtore of in your Ships? What, (ſaid he) we meant to whip you Hereticks to death that have aſſiſted my Maſters Rebels, and done ſuch diſhonour to our Catholick King and People. But what would you have done (ſaid they) with their Young Children? They (ſaid he) that were above 7 Years, ſhould have gone the ſame Way their Fathers went, and the reſt ſhould have lived. Only, we would have branded them in the Foreheads with the Letter <hi>L.</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:93865:86"/>
for <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and reſerved them for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bondage.</p>
            <p>This I take God to Witneſs, (ſaith my Author) I received of theſe great Lords as on Examination before the Council, and by their Commandment publiſhed it to the Army.</p>
            <p>The next day (ſaith he) the Queen rode through her Army, attended by <hi>Leiceſter, Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Norris,</hi> and diverſe other great Lords, where ſhe made an excellent Oration to her Army, and commanded a Publick Faſt to be kept.</p>
            <p>After this great Deliverance Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> (who ever held ingratitude Baſe, Eſpecially towards her Almighty Protector) as ſhe began with Prayer, ſo ſhe ended with Praiſe and Thanksgiving, commanding Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Thanksgiving to be Celebrated in the Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> on <hi>Sunday Sept.</hi> 18. at which time 11. of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Enſigns were hung upon the lower Battlement of that Church.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her ſelf on <hi>Sunday Sept.</hi> 24. came to St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and humbling her ſelf on her Knees, with audible voice ſhe praiſed God for that Wonderful Deliverance wrought to Her and her People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:93865:87"/>
At <hi>Southwark</hi> Fair alſo the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flags were hung upon <hi>London</hi> Bridge. But the ſolemn Day appointed for Thankſgiving through the Nation was <hi>Nov.</hi> 19. being <hi>Tueſday,</hi> which accordingly was obſerved with great Joy and Praiſing of God.</p>
            <p>This Admirable Deliverance was congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated by moſt other Nations, eſpecially Reformed, and ſeveral Learned Men cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the ſame in Verſe, among which I only mention two: The firſt is that <hi>Poem</hi> made by Reverend Dr. <hi>Beza,</hi> which is this:</p>
