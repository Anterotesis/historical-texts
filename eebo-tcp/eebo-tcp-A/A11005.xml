         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſelect Pſalmes; Yee, right honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="tcp:10992:3"/>
and dearely beloved in Chriſt, came
firſt into my minde. The chiefe thing that
mooved me thus to doe, was the diſcharge
of my promiſe, wherein I was bound vnto
you, ever ſince the booke came home (which
was in Sommer laſt) At which time, I
happening to reade vnto you a little of the
Expoſition vppon the 42. Pſalme: Ye deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me very earneſtly to tranſlate the whole
booke; which thing I granted-to, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to performe. Behold therefore, my
promiſe is now in the mercy and aſsiſtance
of God fulfilled to you. And next, I being
ever deſirous to teſtifie my duetifull and
thankfull minde vnto you (as one to whome
I was, and is much beholden to in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes)
I thought that there could be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

worke, vvhich conteineth great ſtore
of moſt comfortable doctrines, as I truſte ye
ſhall confeſſe, when ye haue well peruſed
the ſame, ſo that the onely reading thereof,
may iuſtly commend it many waies, even to
ſuch as are of great learning, godlineſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:10992:3"/>
and vertue. For if we reſpect the Author,
it is God himſelfe, who vſed <hi>DAVID</hi> and
others, the penners of the ſaid Pſalmes, to
be his inſtruments, that his owne in the
day of their owne particular trouble and
affliction ſhould not lack ſtore of Spirituall
and heavenly comfort. And ſo it is the
word of Conſolation, the lampe of light, to
leade the heauie harted, and caſten-downe
Chriſtian, by reaſon of the troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
by the burthen of ſinne, through
the darke night and thick clowde of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to the throne of Gods mercy and
grace. More-over, there are verie fewe
heades of our Chriſtian faith and religion,
(as Faith, Repentance, Iuſtification, Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
the Reſurrection of his fleſh, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, the nature, cauſes, and effects of
Sinne Originall and Actuall, comfort
for the heavie and ſorrowfull ſoule, and
ſundrie ſuch other poyntes) But they are
moſt pithily, ſolidelie, and with great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie
of the Spirite ſet downe here. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if wee haue an eie to the partie, by
<pb facs="tcp:10992:4"/>
whoſe miniſterie and labours, this Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was written: He was a man, as I may
be hold to teſtifie (being converſant with
him, both in <hi>Sanct-Andrewes,</hi> and in
this ciitie, neere hand this twentie yeares
by gane) to whom the Church of GOD
within this countrey, is as much beholden,
as to any one inſtrument that ever GOD
thruſt out into his harueſt, in this Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being a man indewed with
excellent and manifolde giftes of GOD;
moſt diligent, earneſt, and painefull in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
of the ſame; for bringing vp of the

in the Lord, beating downe of the
adverſaries, winning of people vnto God,
edifying of the flocke of Chriſt, and ſhewing
good example to other in his vpright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
And wee haue all iuſte cauſe
to feare, that the taking away of ſuch a
worthie light, is a fore-runner of Gods

oppreſſed by the grieuouſneſſe of

the multitude of enemies. For hee
cannot ſufficiently wonder at ſuch a

exerciſe his owne, and thoſe that are

times to be ſweete vnto the Electe.
Therefore, God ſuffers them againe
to taſte how bitter the fruit of ſinne
is: Yet notwithſtanding in the mean
time, hee ſo mitigateth this ſenſe of
the fruit of ſinne, that he ſuffereth
them not to feele at one time, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the whole ſharpnes thereof:
And he changeth ſo that part of that
ſenſe and bitternes, which he giveth
to them to be taſted, that out of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes,
he maketh ſweetnes to come;
out of that which is, by the owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the fruit and puniſhment of ſin,
he maketh a way as it were, of amend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment

man may appeare backward, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the heauens: Notwithſtanding God
bringeth it to paſſe, which brought
light out of darknes. Then mark next
in this complaint, and in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of DAVID, that every one of the
godly vſes in their afflictiones to
turne them ſelues at length vnto
God. And that is a plaine proofe, if
there were no more onely, that this
puniſhment which is otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
vpon ſinne, changeth the own
nature: For at no time, the turning
vnto GOD followeth the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in ſo far as it is the puniſhment
of ſin, whatſoever the Papiſts prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of temporall puniſhments and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions

what maner now at laſt doth DAVID
convert himſelfe vnto God? For the
godly man afflicted many waies v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to turne himſelfe vnto God; for
either by confeſſion of his ſinnes, or
by ſeeking deliverance from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10992:8"/>
affliction, or finally, by complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

DAVID in this Pſalme turneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

we reade not that DAVID thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth

knocketh not, let be, to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or refuſer of the grace offered:
For God will haue our faith exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
after that faſhion: albeit other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
he giveth vs not, yea, the leaſte
thing that can bee, becauſe of our
prayers, as for any deſerving cauſe.
<hi>He aunſwered]</hi> To vvit, out of his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10992:18"/>
heavenly ſanctuarie, yea, and out of
the earthly alſo, vnto which his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
preſence was then tyed. This is
ſubjoyned, that all may know that
they ſeeke no ſooner any thing from
God, according to his will, but hee
wil ſurely therwith anſwere them in
ſome meaſure: and ſo they may bee
incouraged from the verie ſucceſſe
of the prayer, to conceiue prayers
thereafter. Alſo, wee ſhall ſee that it
cannot be otherwiſe, but God ſhall
preſently anſwere to our petition, if
we conſider from whence the ſame
is: now it commeth from Gods own
ſpirit it ſelfe; and ſo it is not poſſible
but God will heare his owne Spirit.
Wherefore PAVLE. Rom. 8. 27. 28.
after he had ſaid that <hi>the Spirit maketh
requeſt for vs, with ſighes that cannot be
expreſſed,</hi> preſently he ſubjoynes, <hi>that
God knoweth the meaning of his owne
Spirit:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, God muſt
of neceſſitie heare the interceſſion
of his owne Spirite, and anſwere to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10992:19"/>
the deſire thereof. From whence I
pray you is that, that with ſighes that
cannot be vttered, of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaketh, we feele therewith, that
invtterable ioy, and ſo wee come
from God as if we were ſatisfied: yea
euen then, when that ſelf ſame thing
is not as yet gotten, which hes bene
ſought of him: Surely, none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
but from thence that God hes
aunſwered our petition. For ſo God
vſeth, ſtirring vp in our harts, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnſpeakable joy, to aunſwere vs
when we call. And this ſenſe is more
then all thoſe earthly thinges, more
then this preſent life, yea &amp; al things
belonging thereto: Wherefore hee
hath purchaſed more at Gods hands,
who hath felt this joy, then he who
hath gotten this preſent life from
God, and all things neceſſarie to the
ſame. But now we haue in the end of
the next verſe, what God anſwered
to DAVID, when he ſayeth. <hi>Iehova ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteineth
me]</hi> Therefore God aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10992:19"/>
not ſo much by word as by deed,
then when he vpheld David: Which
thing he ſpake before in more words.
<hi>[Thou art my buckler about mee, my
glorie, and he that lifteth vp mine head,]</hi>
He comprehendeth the ſame thing
in one worde hereafter.<note place="margin">The effect of Gods mercy.</note> 
                        <hi>[He ſuſteined
me]</hi> ſaith he, whereby hee meaneth
that ſenſe of Gods protection, in the
midſt of perſecution. <hi>I layd me downe]</hi>
Now hee commendeth the effecte
which followed ſo gentle an anſwer
of God, of the which he ſpake imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie
before. And it is indeede, ane
certaine ſecuritie of the mind, which
he leaveth to be perceiued be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
Now there are in it, that he laie
downe, that he ſleeped, and that hee
awakened out of ſleepe. For as when
the minde of any man is troubled
through any preſent daunger, either
he goeth not to bed, or if he goe to
bed, he ſleepeth not quietly, neither
yet wakeneth he ſoftly, if peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he ſleepe: So when the minde is
quiet, then indeed a man goeth to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10992:20"/>
bed, he ſleepeth ſecurely, hee awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
ſoftly: Wherefore ſome deepe
ſecuritie of minde, is manifeſted by
thoſe effectes, yea, and that a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
reſt. The thing therefore that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a minde ſecure in troubles, you
ſee it to be Gods preſence, and a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his helpe. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
hath theſe wordes. Rom. 8. 31.
<hi>If God be on our ſide, who ſhall be againſt
vs?</hi> For he felt that quietnes of mind
through Gods preſence, which made
him thereafter, to provoke whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enemies of his ſalvation. Alſo
that is worthie of conſideration, in
what meaning the Apoſtle in that
place vnderſtandes God to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with him. After that he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
rehearſed all Gods benefites, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
begunne at the firſt to the laſt in
theſe wordes. Rom. 8. 29. 30. <hi>Thoſe
which he knew before he alſo predeſtinate,
whom he predeſtinate, them alſa he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
whome hee called, thoſe hee iuſtifyed,
whom he iuſtified, thoſe he gloryfied:</hi> then
he ſubjoyned, verſ. 13. <hi>What ſhall we
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10992:20"/>
ſay to thoſe things?</hi> To the which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation,
he anſwereth, <hi>If God be
on our ſide, who ſhall be againſt vs?</hi> In
which words, ſurely he hath brought
in one ſumme, all the benefits before
ſpoken of; all which eaſilie may bee
brought to this:<note place="margin">How God is with vs.</note> That God is with vs.
Therefore Gods preſence is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his powerfulnes in calling,
juſtifying, and glorifying of vs: So
that if any man would know whether
God be preſent with him or not, hee
muſt ſee, whether if he be called, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
if he be juſtified, and by theſe, as
by the meanes, he muſt aſcend to the
Predeſtination, and fore-knowledge
of God, which were from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
Then leaſt any ſhould doubt of
theſe benefites, by which he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the Lord himſelfe to be preſent
with vs, he bringeth vs to that gift of
his ſon Chriſt, of al gifts the chiefeſt,
and by an argument taken from the
thing that is more, to that which is
les, he concludeth thus, <hi>He who ſpared</hi>

                        <hi>not his onely ſonne, but gaue him for vs to
death, how ſhall he not with him giue vs
all things alſo?</hi> Therefore, you ſee that
the Apoſtle reaſoneth, from Chriſt
given, to all the reſte of the giftes: to
the ende wee ſhould learne from
thence, howe oft ſoeuer wee would
know, whither God be preſent with
vs by his benefites, ſo oft wee muſte
haue our recourſe vnto Chriſt, &amp; we
muſt ſee, whither if wee be partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
of Chriſt of his death, of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
without the which, ſurely
wee haue no preſence of God with
vs, no effectual power of God in vs.
But to the end wee may returne hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from whence wee began: That
is moſt certaine indeed,<note place="margin">The effect of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God.</note> that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, and that indeede by
the ſelfe alone, maketh a man ſecure:
which thing is ſo true, as if thou take
away his preſence, man hath nothing
in him but feare and horror, ſpecially
when any grieuous affliction ſeazeth
vpon him: Or if there be any ſorte of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10992:24"/>
quietneſſe of minde, that is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinge, but a fleſhlie ſecuritie,
which is a token of the ſuddaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to come. PAVLL ſayeth. 1.
Theſſ. 5. 3. <hi>When they ſhall ſay peace and
ſafetie: then ſhall come vppon them ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
deſtruction, as the trauel vpon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with childe, and they ſhall not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape.</hi>
Therefore, to the ende there
may be a deepe ſleepe, and a ſofte
wakening out of ſleepe, that is, that
there be a true ſecuritie of minde, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man muſt take heede, that hee
feele God preſent with him, preſent
I ſay, when he goeth to bed, when he
awaketh in the night: for our ſleepe
ſhould bee no ſooner interrupted in
the night, but we ſhould haue our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
vnto God: Albeit men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
are chiefely diſtracted in the
night, with the cares of this worlde,
yea, with lighter and vayner try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles.
More-over, nothing hath more
ſtrength, either to ſettle the minde in
the night time, or to call it backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10992:25"/>
to ſleepe, and to refreſh the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
with reſt, then that ſweete medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
vpon God. Finally, when the
time of awaking commeth in the
morning, everie man muſt take head
that he finde God preſent with him,
when he goeth foorth of the houſe,
when hee commeth in againe, while
he eateth, while he drinketh, while he
is doing any thing, continually that
preſence of God is to be ſought. Alſo
wee haue God preſent at all times, if
with our voyce we cry vnto Iehova,
as DAVID did, or if alſo, when
there is not place for the voyce, wee
call vpon him with our hearte, which
thing yerely may be done, without
hindring the moſt ſerious buſineſſe
we haue ado, to leaue alſo that vnſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, that this way ſpecially, all the
honeſt adoes of this life, may be hand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
with a certain inutterable delight.
Now the grounde of this preſence is
Chriſt, without whoſe croce and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
ſet before our eies, no entrie
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10992:25"/>
is patent vnto God.<note place="margin">An other effect of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</note> 
                        <hi>I will feare none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill]</hi>
In this verſe, he enlargeth that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie
which he felt through Gods
preſence, while hee ſayeth, that hee
hath no cauſe to feare hereafter, no,
not indeed ten thouſands of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
The amplifying therefore is
partly from the time to come, partly,
from the multitude of the enemies:

people would pitch their tents about
me, notwithſtanding I will not bee
ſhaken with fear. Of the which thing
you learne, that this is the force of
the quietneſſe of the minde in God,
that there is nothing which it is not
able to over-come. From thence
<hi>Paule,</hi> after he had numbred out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things, which are contrarie to vs
in this life, ſuch as were anguiſhes,
oppreſſion, and the reſt; finally, hee
ſubjoyned. Rom. 8. 36. 37. <hi>Yea, in all
thoſe things we are more then conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10992:26"/>
through him who hath loved vs:</hi>
Behold, you may ſee the grounde of
this ſecuritie and victorie: To wit,
the loue of God in Chriſt. For when
there is that ſenſe of the loue of God
in Chriſt, and conſequently, any taiſt
of that life to come (for this laſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
alway of that former) then in
deede the childe of God is ſo caryed
aboue al thoſe thinges inferiour, that
from on high he deſpiſeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth
them.<note place="margin">The cauſe brought out of the Apoſtle.</note> Nowe the Apoſtle in
the ſame place, bringeth in the cauſe
why we are more then conquerours
through the loue of God. <hi>For I am
perſwaded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that neither death
nor life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is able to ſeparate vs from the
loue of God.</hi> For if thoſe things, which
are reckoned out in that Chapter,
might ſeparate vs from the loue of
GOD, then certainely, wee ſhoulde
eaſilie fall vnder the burden through
them. But ſeeing they are not able
to bring that to paſſe that GOD
in Chriſt ſhould not loue vs, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10992:26"/>
wee alſo feele that loue in Chriſte,
and out of that loue, life: ſurely it
will never come to paſſe, that thoſe
things fall vtterlie oppreſſe vs: But
on the other, it falleth out directlie
to the contrarie, that wee over come
them all, DAVID therefore, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to him agayne, was ſo cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away through the ſenſe of Gods
preſence and loue, in the middeſt
of perſecution; that hee ſecurelie
deſpiſed all the contrarie power, as
one, who had perſwaded himſelfe
of that, that it was not able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
him from that loue of God in
Chriſte, the ſenſe whereof indeede
he had at that time. For it is not to
bee thought that this voyce of DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID,
and his glorying, aroſe chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of that ſecuritie, which hee had
then perhaps of the certainty of the
keeping of this life preſente: But
much more of that ſecuritie, which
he had of the certainty of that life to
come, yea &amp; that through the feeling
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10992:27"/>
of the loue which is in Chriſt Ieſus:
For that is the differance betuixt the
godly and others which ſtretch not
their hope farther nor this life: Thoſe
are never at eaſe, neither yet can they
glorie, except they be firſt ſure of this

aske in this place, ſeeing now before

He gloryed, I ſay, againſt all his

how commeth it to paſſe, that nowe
he is ſo carefull of this life, and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
ſo earneſtly at God, that hee

danger? I anſwer, that this great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the godlie, and the contempt
of this preſent life, fighteth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelues. And the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones
of this ſorte, whereby they

<hi>Salvation it ſelfe]</hi> Thereafter he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for the people, yea, for that parte
of the people which followed after
<hi>Abſchalom,</hi> and was ſeduced of him.
One would marvell, that DAVID in
ſuch a great daunger of his life, is ſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10992:29"/>
mindfull in his prayer of the people,
&amp; ſalvation of others: For this would
appeare to bee of a man that is ſet a
part from all perill and daunger, not
onely to reſpect himſelfe, or his own
life, but alſo others, and the ſalvation
of others. But it is to be knowne, that
this is the diſpoſition of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of that vniverſall body of Chriſt,
that it is not onely touched with a
ſenſe of the owne miſerie, but alſo it
is commoved with a compaſſion of
the reſte of the members of the ſame
body: And looke how much the
more it is touched with a ſenſe of the
owne miſerie, ſo much the more it
ſuffereth with the reſt, whom it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be miſerable. For he who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet felt any miſerie, ſurely that
man is vnmeet to pitie others, whom
he ſeeth to be oppreſſed with miſery.
Alſo, the reaſon of this petition is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the nature of God him ſelf.

him his owne nature, eſpecially, that

are not indeede ſo many ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones

God lay them on vpon his owne, to

the afflictiones of the godlie, are ſo
many temporall puniſhments inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
becauſe of their ſinnes, which of
neceſſitie they muſt ſuffer, either in
this world, or in the other, That is,
in Purgatorie. For they ſaye, that
Chriſthes onely taken away by his
death that everlaſting puniſhment.
By which lie, who is he not that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
how much is derogated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10992:33"/>
only one &amp; perfit ſacrifice of Chriſt.
Therefore I affirme, that theſe are
not ſatisfactiones for ſinnes, or the
puniſhments of ſinnes, but fatherlie
chaſtiſements, by which God of his
mercie exerciſeth his owne in this
life, that they be not vtterly caſten vp
in a deepe ſleepe of fleſhlie ſecuritie,
&amp; ſo periſh with the reſt of the world.
Which thing, albeit it be true, yet
notwithſtanding, afflictiones manie
times darkeneth ſo in our ſight, that
mercy and loue of God in Chriſt,
that the very Godly are afrayde alſo
when they are chaſtiſed, leaſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

of God bee poured out vpon them.
Now this feare aryſeth not ſo much
of the renevved part of the minde, as
it doth of the fleſh and vnregenerate
part of the ſoule: <hi>For loue caſteth out
feare.</hi> 1. Ioh. 4. 18. Therefore it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
of the fleſh, that DAVID fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

a ſure evidence, that he, even at
that time had apprehended ſome

haue ſome ſight (howſoever at ſome

this once, of this griefe of DAVID,
this is firſt manifeſt, that it was not ſo
much contracted, by reaſon of the
bodely ſicknes, with which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
hee was moſt heavily op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
as it was indeede, by reaſon
of the feeling of the wrath of God, &amp;
thoſe terrours of hel, the which grief
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10992:45"/>
indeed is the greateſt that can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined,
&amp; none is to be compared

one, who now before had oft taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
how gracious the Lorde was, as
PETER <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

at this ſame verie time, was not
altogether voyde of all feeling of his
mercy. And therefore it came to
paſſe, that he tooke this wrath of the
angrie GOD, in ſo evill a parte.
For it is ſure, that howe much the
more greater the experience of the
mercie of God be, ſo much the more
doth any man take in evill parte, the
wrath of God, and he is the more in
that reſpect troubled through the
offence of ſo mercifull a Father.

no man of greater courage of mind
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10992:45"/>
then <hi>David,</hi> notwithſtanding at this

as it were in teares, for that invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

what other thing els would this bee,
then to harden our heart againſt the

we haue not experience of this grief
in our ſelues, which <hi>David,</hi> as he hath
vttered in this Pſalme, ſayeth was in

and after ſhame ſorrow, and
of that chiefely conſiſteth ſhame and
dolour, in that they ſee the godly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
their expectation, lifted vp and
delivered: For this will be the chiefe
part of the confuſion and ſorrowe of
the reprobat, in that day of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Lord, that theſe, whom
they ſome-time ſought to deſtroy v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

deſtroyed out of the worlde, ſo that
there-after, there ſhould bee no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance

ſhall finde them in a momente, and
ſuddenly glorified, beſide their hope
and expectation, they themſelues, &amp;
the whole worlde looking on. One
objection reſteth to be lowſed: what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is not this the part of fooliſh and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10992:53"/>
men, ſo to glorie againſt their
enemies? I anſwere; The godly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and the wicked do glorie, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a diverſe manner. The wicked
glory, truſting to their own ſtrength,
to their counſelles, to their riches;
finallie, to the arme of men: But the
godly reioyce, leaning onely to the
preſence and grace of GOD. And
this is none other thing then to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
God, which, what other thing is
it, then to vtter out that inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in God, yea, and that in the
face of the enemies &amp; mockers them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues,
who moſte earneſtly travell to

from that loue in Chriſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they

all that feeling of his grace, Of which
PAVLE ſpeaketh, Rom. 8. 38. Who
ſhal ſeparate vs from the loue of God
in Chriſt? It is true indeede, that the
vngodly alſo vſes to vaunte of the
favour &amp; grace of God. So the Papiſts
this day vaunt of Chriſt, when in the

turneth him to his owne ſoule, and

of the Pſalme, The bleſſing. Having

DAVID burſteth foorth into a
bleſſing, that exceeding great joy, to
wit, which proceeded from God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding
to God againe, the author
thereof: For the prayſe and bleſſing
of Gods name, preſently followeth
that felt joy, proceeding from God:
and of what meaſure the joy is, in the
ſame meaſure is the bleſſing. If there
be no joy, there is no bleſſing, if there

it be more or leſſe, to wit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the meaſure and quantitie of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10992:63"/>
the joye. But in the heavens, where

we ſhal ſay, <hi>Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God almightie. Who counſelleth]</hi>
Here followe the argumentes of the
bleſſing, from the benefites of God
toward him. For after that once the
rejoycing of the heart, hath lowſed
the tongue to prayſe God, then there
ſhall lacke no matter of prayſe. The
benefites of God are of two ſortes,
partly, they belong to this preſente
life, as the counſell of God, in ſeeking
the weill of his owne, and a certaine
vnmoueable ſtedfaſtnes, in this verſe,
and in the verſe following: partely,
they belong to the life to come, as
the reſurrection, as everlaſling life,
from the ninthverſe to the end of the
Pſalme. Then this is the firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of bleſſing, in that he hath God
to be his counſellor. <hi>Who councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi>
me (ſaith he) that is, which thing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10992:64"/>
hee hath not once ſpoken in the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.
Pſalme nor elſewhere. <hi>Who teacheth
me his waies.]</hi> Now hee taught DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID
his waies, whileſt he enlightned
his minde to this purpoſe; that hee
might ſee thoſe things, which were
acceptable and pleaſant vnto God.
Hee taught him alſo his waies, when
he directed his hearte to follow out
thoſe things, which were acceptable
to God. For ſuch is the blindneſſe of
our mind, as concerning good things
and that are pleaſant in Gods ſight;
alſo, ſuch is the frowardneſſe of our
heart, that vnleſſe the Lord put to his
owne hand to enlighten, reforme, &amp;
make vs new over againe, we cannot
ſo much truely as thinke one good
thing. Wherefore, whoſoever wil do
any thing aright, and with commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
of neceſſitie hee muſt haue
God to be his counſellour: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Kings ar warned to do this chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the example of King DAVID
who vſed not to come out into the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10992:64"/>
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, with the nobilitie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
except hee had firſt conſulted
with his GOD. <hi>In the nights]</hi> Hee
ſheweth the time inſpeciall, when
God gaue him his counſell: as if hee
ſhould ſay, Not onely in the day, but
alſo in the night hee gaue me his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe:
That is, there is no time in which
he doth not cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel me. Of the which,
it appeareth that <hi>David,</hi> being a man
otherwiſe diſtracted in the nights,
with diverſe cares &amp; tentations (as he
was indeed that man who was a type
of Chriſt; &amp; his afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; tentations
wer figurs in ſpecial of the afflictions
&amp; tentations of Chriſt that were to
come) it appeareth, I ſay, that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo diſtracted, was accuſtomed in
the night by prayer, to haue his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
vnto God, and to vſe him as it
were in his hard affayres, to bee his
counſeller, whereby alſo it came to
paſſe, that as he teſtifyeth of himſelfe
in an other place, when being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
altogether in anxietie and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10992:65"/>
trouble oft, he went to bedde in the
evening tyde, yet in the morning he
aroſe out of bed joyfull, &amp; as it were
altogether ſprinkled over with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Nowe this was not done for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other cauſe, then that he had God
to bee his counſellour, even in the
night. It is a grieuous &amp; heavy thing
indeed, if any man be deprived in the
night, of this bodielie eaſe, &amp; bodely
ſenſes, which are wearied nowe the
whol day long, by hearing much, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much, &amp; handling much, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
that is farre more grievous, if any bee
not onely deprived of that reſt of the
bodie, but alſo in the meane time be
diſtracted with diverſe cares and
thoughtes of the minde. This is for
the moſt parte the cauſe of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheries
in the night, that ſo fewe in
their troubles, haue their refuge vnto
God, and laye them not downe as it
were in his boſome; but they had far
rather without God, fight &amp; wraſtle
with their faſheries and cares, where
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10992:65"/>
by it commeth to paſſe, that they are
more and more diſturbed with the

whereby God gaue him counſell: &amp;
it is by the holy ſpirite, which hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth

Finally, he attributeth a ſecure habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
vnto his fleſhe, that is, to his

rayſe the wicked, yea, againſt their

ſhall walke therein: By theſe wordes
therefore he vnderſtandeth, that the

that he ſal be rayſed out of the graue.
Now in the words following, he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth

Even ſo, ſayeth DAVID, Iehova
quencheth my thirſt, and refreſheth

DAVID hath commended the care of
God, as of a ſheephearde toward his
bodie. Learne therefore what the
care of GOD is towarde our body:
None there is of all the godly whom
he ſatisfieth not with meate &amp; drink:

what delight can the body take of

when the ſoule is in ſome exceeding

GOD taketh thought of his ſoule,
and that it is quieted of him. Everie

of God, and feeleth that quietneſſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:10992:77"/>
and peace of the minde, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth

directlie contrarie, it is to bee recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

conſcience perſwaded of the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſinnes. For looke how ſoone
God doth juſtifie vs, our ſoules then
begin to be at reſt, and to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

open to danger, let him haue a rod in
readineſſe, whereby he may cal back,
and a ſheepe-crooke, whereby hee
may draw it backe againe. So DAVID
confeſſeth, that hee was called and
drawen backe, with the rod &amp; ſheep-crook
of Gods holy Spirit, by his God
as by a faithfull Paſtor, after the ſame
maner, doth God take heed to every
way whatſoever, of every godly man
that loveth him, not only by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
providence, whereby all men
without difference, liue by him, are
and mooue: But much more, by that
particular providence of his, wherby
he ruleth them by his holy Spirite,
whereby, as by a hand they are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in all their waies, and if it fall out
ſo, that they goeaſtray from the way,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10992:79"/>
they are brought again into the way
by that ſelfe ſame Spirite. You ſee
how much DAVID commendeth the
provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God: the ſame
thing doe all the godly, while they
feele they do nothing without God,
and while they feele alſo after what
manner they attaine vnto the Butt,
that they themſelues ar taken hold
on by God, and that they are led on
vnto that ſelfe ſame Butt: while they
feele alſo GOD to be preſent with
them in all their waies moſte dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
whatſoever, whereby they muſt
of neceſſitie paſſe vnto the heauens.
For there is no ſolide ioy in doing of
any thing, vnleſſe wee feele the holy
Spirite of God to be the directer and
the moover. Moreover, it is to bee
marked in this place, that no daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
no afflictiones, no, not death it
ſelfe can ſeparate vs from God.<note place="margin">The ſure confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly.</note> For
he ſaieth: <hi>Although I walk through the
valley of the deadly ſhaddow, I would not
feare, becauſe thou art with me]</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10992:79"/>
it is thought, that God is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from that man, who is brought
to ſome extreame danger, who hath
his abiding in the middeſt of death.
For they perceiue not howe thoſe
thinges can ſtande with the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God: even as though God
were not able to hold vs vp, vnleſſe
he vpheld this body and this preſent
life. Alſo, this is the moſt ſure ſigne
of Gods preſence in perils, that the
godly are voyde of all feare, and that
they are of a bold &amp; couragious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
For, for this he ſayeth. <hi>I would not
feare, becauſe thou art with mee]</hi> Thou
ſeeſt then, to ſpeake it in one ſumme,
how particular the care of GOD is
toward his owne: For ſeeing in man,
three things are to be conſidered; the
bodie, the ſoule, the actiones; God
leaveth none of thoſe deſtitute of his
preſence; to the bodie he furniſheth
nuriſhment and governement, hee
maketh the ſoule to be at reſt, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
the actions of the body: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:10992:80"/>
yet onely hath he this particular
care of his owne: But (which thing I
haue ever reckoned amongſte the
chiefeſt of Gods benefites) he perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
cauſeth them to feele ſome
ſenſe of his providence and care to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
them, ſo that they are able to
declare particularlie the ſortes of
Gods providence, and to attribute
fullie to God, the whole glory of the
ſame. <hi>Thou furniſheſt]</hi> Hee openeth
vp in proper wordes, the former alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie,
borrowed from the cuſtome
of a good ſheepheard, and hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
that whole care of God
toward him, in thoſe three parts, as it
were. The firſt is: <hi>That he furniſheth a
table before him]</hi> The ſecond, <hi>That
he annoynteth his head with oyle.</hi> The
third,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</note> 
                     <hi>That he maketh his cup very full]</hi>
The firſt and the third parte,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 17.</note> belong
to the neceſſary nuriſhment:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13. 12.</note> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
to the decorement; for the aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cientes
for the moſt parte, were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
with oyles and oyntments
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:10992:80"/>
for braverie and ſeemelineſſe cauſe,
and not for any neceſſity. Wherefore
thoſe who were in the mourning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
abſteyned from annoyntings.
That which he ſayeth in the firſt part
is to be marked. <hi>Thou furniſheſt a table
before mee, over againſt mine enemies]</hi>
Wherby he ſignifieth, that in deſpite
of his enemies, he was fed &amp; nuriſhed
of God, by the which great honour
redounded vnto him, and the greater
was the confuſion of his enemies,
while in the meane time that they
are looking on, he is ſo honoured of
GOD. Then wee are to note in the
third part, that which he ſayeth, <hi>That
God maketh his cup to abound]</hi> For hee
vnderſtandeth the aboundance and
increaſe of thinges neceſſarie to this
life, as of drink. Conſidder therefore
of the care of God toward his owne,
and howe liberallie he dealeth with
them: he beſtoweth vpon them, not
only thoſe things which belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
neceſſitie, but thoſe things which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10992:81"/>
are for decorement: againe, he furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
not the thinges niggardlye,
which belong vnto neceſſitie, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly
and liberally. And all
thoſe thinges ſurely he doth for their
cauſe, their enemies in the meane
time, looking on, and ſore againſte
their willes, whereby the greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
may redound vnto them, and that
the confuſion of their enemies may
be the greater, while they ſee thoſe
to be honoured of God, whom they
earneſtly deſired to be deſtroyed. So
God honoureth euery waye thoſe,
who honour him. <hi>Surely goodneſſe and
mercy]</hi> An expoſition of the ſeconde
part of the propoſition, that is, of the
ſecuritie for the time to come: For
he gloryeth of the ſecuritie, and hee
promiſeth vnto himſelfe, both all
good things in this life, and alſo the
everlaſting kingdome in the life to
come. Concerning this ſecuritie, we
haue obſerved ſome thing vpon the
firſt verſe before; now this one thing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:10992:81"/>
I adde to this only, And I ſeeke the
cauſe from whence it commeth to
paſſe, that anye man gloryeth ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely,
of the feeling of the preſente
favour of God, &amp; promiſeth ſo ſurely
to himſelfe, that he ſhall never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of that favor in time to come?
The cauſe is, not any thing in vs, nor
that loue whereby we loue God: for
there is nothing in vs that can make
vs to be at reſt, ſuch is our inconſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy
by very naturall diſpoſition: but the
cauſe is that free favour of God, who
loveth him, whom he hath begun to
loue forever, in that his welbeloved
ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. PAVLE gloryeth
ſecurely, not indeede of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of
that loue, whereby he himſelf loved
God, but of the <hi>Feeling</hi> of that loue,
whereby God in Chriſt had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

                     <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate vs</hi> (ſayeth

the loue of God toward vs, from the
which, by no kinde of force, wee are

therefore of al ſecuritie, be vnto God
in Chriſt for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

every man is bounde, after that firſte
he hath felt his own miſerie, then his
free deliverance in Chriſt, according
to his calling, to deliver over vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as it were, the doctrine of the
miſerie and bleſſedneſſe of man. DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VLD

riches of this worlde, not in honor &amp;
glorie, not in pleaſures, not in the
workes and merites of men: but in
the grace of God alone, &amp; in the free
remiſſion of ſinnes. Alſo, thoſe whom
he taketh in hand to teach, are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
men, miſerable, I ſay &amp; it were
no more but by reaſon of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and of death, yea, or rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of that fleſhly ſecurity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
many are caſten vp ſo in a deepe
ſleepe, that neither are they touched
with a ſenſe of ſinne, nor of miſerie:
which eſtate, ſurely is of all eſtates
far moſt perilous. Then thoſe ar they
whom he teacheth this true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
&amp; to whom, by viue voyce he
poynteth out, as it were, with the
finger, that onely cauſe, which pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifieth
and bleſſeth the conſciences
of miſerable men, to wit, the free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſinne in Chriſt. Moreover
there are three ſorts of ſpeeches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
remiſſion of ſinnes, in the
two firſt verſes, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                        <hi>Bleſſed is he which is eaſed]</hi> (ſayth he:)
DAVID feeling himſelfe as it were

the cauſe wherefore wee feele not

commeth to paſſe, that either ſin is

the deadly ſopour, were ſhaken off

that they are heavier, then he is able

whereby hee expreſſeth vnto vs the
remiſſion of ſinnes. Hee felt out of all
queſtion, firſt a judgement ſeate, ſet
vp, as it were, in his owne ſoule, and
an accuſing conſcience, that his ſin
was imputed vnto him, by God the
judge. Then this whole judgement
being remooved out of his ſoule by
Chriſt, that his ſinne was not layde
to his charge. Of this it commeth to
paſſe, that being refreſhed; he cryed
out, &amp; commendeth him to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bleſſed, to whom God imputeth
not ſinne. But if we, after the ſame
maner, rayſing vp a judgement ſeate
in our hearts, would firſt ſee &amp; feele
our conſcience accuſing vs, God ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in judgement, and ſin to be laide
to our charge by GOD the judge,
ſurely, wee would call that man bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with DAVID, to whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth
not ſin. But ſuch is our greate
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10992:87"/>
ſluggiſhneſſe, that albeit, we be other
wile ſinners, notwithſtanding, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be very hardly, ar we touched
with any ſenſe of ſin, yea, even then
when the wrath of GOD exerciſeth
vs, wee are not drawen on to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
of our ſinne, but verie
hardly. Out of this laſte forme of
ſpeech, whereby DAVID publiſhed
the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, we learne
alſo from DAVIDS example himſelf,
we learne I ſay, firſt, what is the eſtate
of the ſoule of a ſinner, which is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
deepely with a conſcience of
his owne ſinne, and thereby is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto grace. He feeleth, that there
is a judgment ſeat ſet vp in his ſoule,
and that God himſelfe the judge, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
therein: Then the conſcience of
ſinne accuſeth, and God the judge
layeth ſinne to the charge, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vppon the filthineſſe thereof, as
with a terrible eie, From thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
a deepe ſenſe of ſinne, and a
burden that is not able to be borne,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10992:87"/>
of ſinne, I ſay, which appeared a little
before, to be of no weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Of this alſo aryſes horrours &amp;
terrours of hell, which if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
any longer, they would driue
a man vnto deſperation. Wee haue
againe alſo in the example of DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID,
the conſtitution of the ſoule of
the ſinner, after that ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given:
Hee feeleth within himſelfe,
that all that judgement ceaſeth, that
his conſcience as a witneſſe accuſeth
him no more of ſinne, and that ſin is
not layde vnto his charge by God
the judge: he feeleth alſo, that what-ſo-ever
remanent of ſinne, is in the
corrupte nature, that it is whollie
covered ſo, with the righteouſneſſe
&amp; perfite obedience of Ieſus Chriſt,
that the angrie face of GOD, is no
more directed againſt the ſame: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
he feeleth now, that his ſin is not
imputed vnto him, and ſo, as I ſaid, it
being covered, he feeleth it to bee a
burden vnto him no more. And in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10992:88"/>
deede, when any is disburdened of
the burden of ſinne, ſinne appeareth
vnto him to bee a light thing, not by
reaſon of that fleſhlie ſecuritie, but
for the mercy of God in Chriſt his
ſake it is made light &amp; of little weight

                        </gap>credible
peace and quietneſſe of conſcience,
which is none other thing then that
bleſſednes, which DAVID commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
For when he had once intirely
felt it in his ſoule, he reteineth it not
within his owne minde: But hee is
compelled to common thereof with
others, that, if it be poſſible, other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
men alſo (ſuch as we are all by
nature) may be touched with ſome
ſenſe and ſweetneſſe thereof, in ſome
meaſure, that ſo they may become
bleſſed. More-ouer, wee haue alſo to
learne out of DAVIDS words, that
which PAVLE alſo gathered out of
the recommendation of this bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of DAVID,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 6.</note> to wit, that that man
is bleſſed, to whom the Lord impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10992:88"/>
righteouſneſſe without workes,
that is, that a man is made righteous,
not by any inherent righteouſneſſe,
which proceedeth from his workes,
but by righteouſnes imputed onely.
For if juſtification and bleſſednes, be
by forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, of neceſſity
it muſt follow, that juſtification is by
righteouſneſſe, not ſurely inherent,
but imputed. For forgiueneſſe is alſo
of ſinne inherent: Nowe ſinne being
inherence, that righteouſneſſe is not
inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but imputed. This neceſſary
conſecution of imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
from the forgiuenes of ſinnes,
cauſed PAVLE to interpret that place
that DAVID ſpak expreſſely of the
remiſſion of ſinnes, even as if he had
ſpoken of imputed righteouſnes. But
this matter, ſhall become more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by ſome example, taken from
judgement ſeats, and from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cuſtomes among men. For the
matter is none otherwiſe to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of, in this head of juſtification,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10992:89"/>
then if any King of free grace would
forgiue the ſinne to any guylty man.
As for example, to a man-ſlayer, even
now condemned for his ſinne: Now
this man, his ſinne being forgiven, is
ſaid to be juſtified. But by what righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
I praye you? not by that
which is inherent: For in him ſelfe in
very deede, hee is a man-ſlayer. By
what righteouſneſſe then? ſurely by
none other, then by that, which was
freelie imputed by the King, to wit,
by that whereby hee thinketh him
righteous, who is not righteous in
himſelfe. The ſame in all reſpectes, is
the manner of our juſtification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the judgement ſeate of God the
judge. Wee are not indeede juſte
through our owne works, but vnjuſt,
Neither yet doth God pronounce
vs to be righteous for our works. But
the juſtification of GOD, that is, the
publiſhing of the juſt, is that wherby
he vttereth that man is vnjuſt, to bee
juſt, of his only mercy in Chriſt. Now

the two former differ from
this third, that ſeeing in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
the cauſe of the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
is in him that is juſtified, in
this third ſorte, the cauſe of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of juſtifying is without him that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10992:90"/>
is juſtified, to make it clearer, in that
firſt maner of juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the cauſe of
juſtifying is in the works of the man
juſtified. So ADAM had bin juſtifyed,
if he had ſtoode in the obedience of
God, ſo Chriſt was juſtified for our
cauſe, by his own righteous works,
&amp; by the perfite loue vpon all ſides
of GOD, and of his Neighbour.
In the ſeconde ſorte of juſtification
which is by puniſhment, the payne
it ſelfe, which is ſuffered by the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
man, is the ſubject and the
cauſe, why he is juſtified of GOD.
So Chriſt alone is juſtifyed for our
cauſe, and hee is made for vs the
curſe of the law; alſo, he hes fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
the law by his death. Laſte, in
the thirde manner of juſtification,
the cauſe is, that ſelfe ſame ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is in Chriſte him ſelfe,
with-out vs, as in ane ſubject, but
after ſome ſorte made aires, to wit,
by faith. So then by this third man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
al the faithful are juſtified, by the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10992:91"/>
cauſe of juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
which is with out vs. DAVID
therfore, that we may returne to him
again, ſpeaketh not of the firſt juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
nor of the ſecond, but of the
third; &amp; he attributeth the juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; bleſſednes of man, not to the works
of man himſelf, nor to the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
taken according to the threatning of
the law vpon man himſelfe, but only
to the free remiſſion of ſins. Which
ſorte of juſtification, is accompliſhed
after this order. Firſt, the ſinfull man
being called of God, beleeveth in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, to whoſe ſacrifice, the
wrath of God purſuing him, hee is
compelled after ſome ſort, one or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to flie, as vnto a certaine Girth.
Then taking holde vppon that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
the wrath of God is now pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The wrath being aſſwaged, there
is place for grace and mercy, and
therefore of grace, he forgiveth him
his ſinne, and therewith imputeth to
the ſinner, that righteouſneſſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:10992:91"/>
of Chriſt, which by faith
before he had apprehended. And ſo
in theſe two things, is ſituat that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the cauſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
wee ſee to be Chriſts ſatisfaction,
with-out man himſelf, except in this
reſpect you ſay it to be in man, in ſo
far as it is apprehended by faith. And
this faſhion of juſtification, is no leſſe
effectual, yea, it is much more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and full, then if God had juſtified
vs for any cauſe, which can be in vs.
For the peace and quietnes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is no leſſe, neither yet is that

Moreover, they are the <hi>fore knowledge
of Gods Predeſtination vnto life, calling,
iuſtifying, gloryfiing.</hi> Then there is no
cauſe why any ſhould gather out of
this place, that a man is alſo juſtified
through holineſſe of life, and good
works, becauſe the prophet ſaith, <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is he in whoſe hart ther is no guyle:</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that by the word of bleſſednes is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10992:93"/>
meant juſtification; but the common
effect of all the reſte of the bleſſings,
of which hesbene even now ſpoken,
and among the which, ſanctification
is reckoned out as one. Then we may
define the bleſſed man, from his
owne cauſes going before, that it is
he, who is called, juſtified and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
of the fore-knowledge and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination
of GOD. Out of thoſe
thinges you perceiue, that ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſynceritie and cleaneſſe of the
heart, are required to bleſſedneſſe,
which in this life, is no other thing,
but a begunne glorifying, and that
bleſſedneſſe is the common effect of
all. Neither yet alſo ſhall it appeare, if
the ſentence of the Apoſtle be taken
good head to in that place, and if his
words be conſiddered, that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
&amp; the juſt man, or juſtified man,
as they thinke commonly, is taken
for one thing. For, bleſſed, alſo with
the Apoſtle is none other thing, then
the bleſſed eſtate of the juſtified ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:10992:93"/>
and the effect of juſtification, or of
imputed righteouſneſſe with-out
workes. From whence alſo it is, that
our Prophete in an other place, in
plaine words, publiſheth a man to be
bleſſed, through the works of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
For I would not expound
the worde bleſſed in that place,<note place="margin">Pſalme. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified:
as if the Prophete, of the
conſequent effectes, deſcribed the
juſtified man: But I would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by the name of, bleſſed, a man
conſtitute in that eſtate of life, which
is the eſtect of juſtification, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and finally, of all ſpirituall
bleſſings in Chriſt. See thoſe things
which we haue obſerved vppon that
place concerning bleſſednes. <hi>When I
held my peace]</hi> Hitherto was ſet down
the propoſition of the bleſſedneſſe
of man: Here followeth the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
thereof, from his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
Alſo, that experience is
two fold: The firſt is of the miſerie, at
what time, to wit, he held his tongue
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10992:94"/>
and confeſſed not his ſinne. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is, of deliverance and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of ſin, that is, to wit, at that time
when he confeſſed his ſin. Then hee
ſayeth firſt: <hi>When I held my tongue, my
bones waxed old]</hi> That is, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
my ſinne within mee, when I
diſſembled the ſame, and confeſſed
not, <hi>My bones waxed olde]</hi> That is,
mine whole bodie was conſumed, &amp;
there was nothing ſo firme in me, no
not indeede ſo much as my bones,
which was not worne away with the
hand of God. Marke the Prophetes
words: for he ſpeaketh not ſo, becaus
<hi>I haue ſinned, my bones conſumed awaye.</hi>
But he ſayeth thus; <hi>When I helde my
peace]</hi> Or when I confeſſed not my
ſin,<note place="margin">Why the godly are afflicted of God.</note> 
                        <hi>My bones wore away]</hi> Of the which
we learne, that the godly are not for
that cauſe afflicted of God, that they
are puniſhed becauſe of their ſinnes,
which are all forgiven, in that alone
ſatisfaction of Chriſte, but to the
ende they may be rayſed vppe out
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10992:94"/>
of that ſluggiſhneſſe, and extreame
deadlie ſecuritie, and may be broght
to repentance. I obſerue this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the enemies, who defende
that afflictions, yea, even of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
are ſo manie temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and ſatisfactiones for ſinne,
when there is but one ſatisfaction of
Chriſt, yea, and that all ſufficiente,
and puniſhmente, which he ſuffered
for all our ſinnes, ſo that, whoſoever
would conjoyne any other ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whatſoever, with this ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt, of force he muſt take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ſome thing, from that moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſatisfying. Much rather therefore
we muſt hold and learne out of this
experience of DAVID, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
afflictiones of the godly, are not
ay by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſinnes, to wit, that
any puniſhment ſhould bee taken of
them, albeit otherwiſe, the originall
and efficient cauſe of them be ſinne,
<hi>For the wages of ſinne is death</hi> (the ſame
judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is to be taken of al temporal
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:10992:95"/>
afflictiones whatſoever.) But GOD
who out of light, bringeth foorth
darkneſſe, hee ſo changeth theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictiones,
which are of the owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the fruites and effectes of ſinne,
that nowe they become certaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
of the godly for their weill.
Then, as I haue ſaid, afflictions come
not for ſinne, as the ende that it may
be puniſhed, but that repentance,
mortification, and converſion may
be wrought. Secondly, marke in this
place, how deepe the deadly ſopour,
yea, of the godly is at ſome time, that
thoſe, who now and then, ſleep ſo in
ſinne, that they cannot be wakened,
vnleſſe it bee with moſt grieuous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictiones,
&amp; as DAVID ſpeaketh, yea,
except their bones be conſumed, &amp;
that alſo (which is a wounderfull
thinge) falleth out, after that they
haue now oft had experience of the
mercy of GOD in Chriſt, &amp; are tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with that ſenſe of the paſſing
ſweete loue of GOD, which ſurely
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10992:95"/>
ought to haue eaſilie, without anie
trouble, alured their mind vnto God.
For he who once hath felt how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
the Lord is, he muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
continually ſeeke the preſence of
God. Notwithſtanding, they are ſo
obdured whiles, and caſt vp into a
deepe ſleepe, that they would never
turne themſelues vnto God, vnleſſe
it were, they were drawen with the
violence of afflictiones. This ſecurity
is wounderful, this ſleepe is marvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
which now and then even cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth-on
vpon the godly, and ſhaketh
off ſo from them, the taiſt of that loue
of God in Chriſt for a time, in which
otherwaies it became them to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
continually to ſeeke God, that
except they were judged of GOD
they ſhuld periſh miſerably with the
reſt of the world. Moreover, we haue
here to mark out of the word, <hi>Of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
ſilence]</hi> whereby indeede ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
obſcurely is meant ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of ſinne, and that oppreſſed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10992:96"/>
with ſilence, and vnrighteouſly with
holden, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. For
there is no man ſo voyde of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which is not ſome time, as it
were, rounded with into the eare, &amp;
admoniſhed of his ſinne. And from
thence it proceedeth, that men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
warned by their conſcience, of
ſinne (whereof, in the meane time
they delight very greatly, and they
indevour to nouriſh the ſame in their
boſome as it were) they travel by all
meanes, to diſſemble and cover their
ſinne, ſo that if it were poſſible,
it ſhould not be marked with Gods
eies, to that end eſpecially, that they
might enjoy ſin, without the brode
of conſcience, and diſquietting of
the minde, which thing indeed, they
cannot attayne vnto, if they knowe
that their ſinne is before the ſight
and eies of God. Of which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to paſſe, that ſome pretend one
excuſe, ſome another; yea, ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
religion, and externall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10992:96"/>
for their ſins. But al thoſe things
are done in vayne: For it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that ſinnes can be covered (as it
was ſaid before) vnleſſe they be hid
with the onely obedience of Chriſt.
<hi>In my roaring]</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I in
the meane time, not acknowledging
my ſinne, was touched indeed with a
preſent ſenſe of my afflictions, all the
daye, I roared like a Lyon, I vttered
very beaſtly noyſes. Of the which we
learne, yea, that the very Hecte and
godly, at what time being delivered
over into their owne hande, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne
to waxe beaſtlie, and to ſleepe
in ſinne, while by afflictions, they be
awakened out of that ſleep, they vſe
to vtter voyces, as of beaſtes, rather
then of men; yea, many times they
murmure and fret againſt God. For
if you will conſidder common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there is no difference betuixte
the Elect and the Reprobat, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and the vngodly. Which ſurely, if
there bee any, it is from God alone,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10992:97"/>
who only puts the difference betuixt
vs, who at laſt allureth the godly vnto
himſelfe, by ſome ſenſe of his loue,
yea, and by his holy Spirite, boweth
their harts: But he leaveth the vngod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
for ever; &amp; being left, it is ſo far a
way, that they are ſoftned by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and calamities, that contrariwiſe
they are judged and become worſe
and worſe. <hi>For day and]</hi> Hitherto
hath the moſt grievous affliction bin
ſet downe; here followeth the cauſe
thereof, as if he ſhould ſaye, no man
hath cauſe to wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, that my bones
are worne awaye, and that I in the
meane time, haue roared like a Lion;
For the hand of God, day and night
oppreſſed me. <hi>Thy hand was heavy v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>day &amp; night]</hi> That is,
continually &amp; without intermiſſion,
and from thence it commeth to pas,
that, <hi>My moſt excellent iuyce, was turned
into the ſommers droughts]</hi> That is, that
juyce, whereby the body was freſh,
did dry-vp, yea, and the whole body
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10992:97"/>
was dryed vp, &amp; became withered.
For it is the amplifying of ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
an oppreſſion, from the owne
effect, becauſe the hand of God op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
him, it wrong out all the ſap
of the bodie. Marke here the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
cauſe of DAVIDS afflictions, not
onely did the afflictiones ſo much
mooue him, as God afflicting, whom
in the meane while, he felt to be his
judge. <hi>Thine hand</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
vpon me]</hi> Wherefore chiefely he
reſpecteth the perſon of the afflicter:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or the afflictions themſelues mooue
men not ſomuch, as the conſcience
of God the judge. For if there bee
ſome feeling of the loue of God, in
the middeſt of afflictiones, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
now to be lighter, becauſe then
we feele, that thoſe afflictions are not
inflicted by God, as a juſt judge now,
but as by a moſt gratious father. But
if in afflictions, there be no feeling of
the mercy of GOD, otherwiſe, the
moſt light now appear to be the moſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10992:98"/>
grievous vnto vs, not ſo much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the afflictions themſelues, as
in reſpecte of the conſcience of the
Iudge. <hi>For it is a terrible thing to fall in
to the hands of the living God:</hi> And of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l enemies the terribleſt, is the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
God chiefely. Many there are, I
confeſſe, who being manie waies mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
afflicted, notwithſtanding, in
the meane time, are either nothing,
or at leaſt very little commoved: For
no other cauſe then that they ſee not
that their afflictions are of God; and
from thence it is, that no regarde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had of GOD, they turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vnto the ſeconde cauſes, and
they powre out their wrath vppon
them, thinking with themſelues, that
then at length they ſhall be bleſſed, if
they can be rigorous againſt them.
But if they vnderſtoode, that GOD
were the author of all thoſe thinges
which ſhall vppon them, and in the
mean time, wil not be touched with a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
ſenſe of his loue &amp; mercy in chriſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10992:98"/>
ſurely they would bee more viuilie
touched with thoſe calamities, and
they would meditat with themſelues
one time or other, concerning the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging
of the wrath and juſtice of
God, and they would not be altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

when the ſinner remayneth obſtinat

Alſo, afflictions and calamities make

godlie, this they by experience feele
in themſelues, that while their faith
in Chriſt languiſheth, and they ſome
times turne themſelues awaie from

in experience, ſome ſignes of the
wrathfull God. And if they alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever
in their back-ſliding, they feele
that God continueth in his anger, to
the ende, to wit, that it may appear
to be moſt manifeſt vnto them, that
there is nothing without Chriſt but
wrath. And if there were no other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
of this matter extante, then
thoſe horrours, which otherwaies
the faithful feele in themſelues, while
they either neglecte Chriſte or his

ynough in their ſoule; ſurely, by that
and it were no more, it is ſufficiently
declared, that men are not in ſafetie
without Chriſt: that there is no true

ſheweth how earneſtlie he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
his ſinne, or ſurelie manifeſteth
that in the adviſement taking, there
was ſome wraſtling or combat with

of ſin, when the guiltineſſe
I ſaie, and whole paine, and not ſome

For Chriſts ſatisfaction for ſin is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
from the which verelie, ſo much
is taken awaie,<note place="margin">1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> as wee giue vnto our
ſatisfactiones: But concerning this
matter, looke before. Obſerue here
firſt, that DAVID confeſſeth not firſte
his ſin, before the ſame be forgiven,
neither tooke he ſooner a purpoſe to
confeſſe his ſinne, but the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of ſinne, was as ſoone taken awaie,
which certainelie is ane evidente to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that ſin is not ſo much the cauſe
of the guyltines and puniſhment, as
hardneſſe, and (as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth)
the heart that cannot repente. I
grant indeed, that ſin procureth the
wrath of God, but obſtinacie in ſin
continueth and hoordeth vppe that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:10992:101"/>
wrath. For if any man would confes
his ſinne, he ſhould haue GOD no
more angrie againſt him. But by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his hardnes, he confeſſeth not
ſinne, therefore the wrath remaineth
and not only it remayneth, but it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth.
Therefore PAVLE ſpeaketh,
<hi>But thou ô man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>after thine hardnes and
hearte that cannot repente, heapeſt vnto
thy ſelfe, wrath againſt the day of wrath,
and of the declaration of the iuſte iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God.</hi> For what ſhall we thinke
to be the cauſe, why that anger that
is to come in that daye, ſhall be ſo
grievous? The cauſe of ſo greate a
wrath, ſurely ſhall not bee ſo much
ſinne it ſelfe, as an obdured heart in
ſinne, and the contempt of grace. For
that which is ſaide by the Apoſtle, is
not to be thought light, <hi>to neglect ſuch
a great ſalvation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 3.</note> is vtterlie to refuſe
the Son of God, <hi>in whom whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
not,</hi> as is ſpoken in IOHN 3. 18.
<hi>Is already condemned, becauſe he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not in the only begotten ſon of God.</hi>

Marke next,<note place="margin">2. leſſon</note> that bold liberty, which
the ſinner, being nowe turned vnto
God, vſeth in this confeſſion of DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID.
<hi>I will confeſſe my ſinne vnto thee]</hi>
(ſaieth DAVID) And this liberty,
manifeſteth the feeling of Gods loue
toward him, and the confidence of
grace and of remiſſion of ſinnes in
Chriſt: For it is not poſſible, that a
ſinner turne him ſelfe vnto GOD,
confeſſe his ſin, and earneſtly craue
for the forgiuenes of his ſinne, vnles
there be already firſt after ſome ſort,
ſome ſenſe of grace and pardon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed.
The conſcience threw out a
confeſſion out of IVDAS, but he durſt
not be ſo bolde as to confeſſe his ſin
before GOD, neither yet to deale
with God after this manner that DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID
doeth in this place. <hi>I will make
my ſinne knowen</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>vnto thee]</hi>
But going aſide, &amp; turning his back

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10992:102"/>
the confeſſion of ſinne before
God, &amp; the craving of pardon, that is,
this libertie wherby any man dareth
be bolde to appeare before him, and
to preſent himſelfe before his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeate ſufficiently doth manifeſt
ſome feeling of grace, and that ſelfe

ſeeke, being purchaſed already in

which was of Gods mercie
immediatly preceeding, from the

<hi>Shal he pray vnto thee]</hi> That is, he ſhall
confeſſe his ſinnes, or he ſhall craue
pardon. <hi>He to whom thou art fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble]</hi>
That is, not by putting any kinde
of difference, but hee onely whome
God loveth. Of this loue and favour,
there muſt of neceſſity be ſome ſenſe,

not indeede, for that ende that hee
thought, that it was not poſſible that
this life preſente, might be taken out
of the world by thoſe things (for hee
himſelfe thereafter felt the contrary
in experience) but for this cauſe, that

this man, that is, to praye, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
finallie he bee, with a promiſe
of that thing which he ſhall craue, &amp;
ſo encourageth him to pray. For by

wil pray with confidence, of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
he muſt haue while he is praying,
continvally before his eies, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes

what confidence, what zeale I praye
you can there be in praying? ſeeing

that without Gods own word, there
cannot be faith, and in vayne ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of this want, and ſo is provoked, and
it were no more, very neceſſity it ſelf
compelling him to conceiue praiers.
But if there be no promiſe of God
before the eyes, no worde of GOD
concerning that thing which they
ſeek with what face; or of what mind
dare they be ſo bolde to come vnto
God? I marke this the more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
for that cauſe, that all may knowe
how neceſſary it were to ſearch
and learne out of the word of GOD

In which verely, whoſoever at

haue their owne ground, &amp; alſo their

Wherefore, whoſoever beholdeth

Hitherto by the waye, the promiſe

in this place. Firſt, DAVID had ſaide
before, that that man whom God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
would pray vnto God by his
exemple, eſpecially, to that end, that
hee might attaine to the like mercie.
But now; not being content of that,
that of their owne accorde, others
ſhould pray vnto God, by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he turneth himſelf about to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:10992:108"/>
one of the faithful, &amp; teacheth him
by his owne voyce. Although the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Gods mercy towarde thee
be excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſelf,<note place="margin">The duty of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere godly man.</note> yea, that others
without thee, bee their teacher, are
able to ſee and follow the ſame, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
thou ſhalt not be ſayd
to haue done thy parte, except thou
turning thy ſelfe vnto thy brethren,
thou thy ſelf declare openly the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God toward thee, &amp; fulfill the
parte of a teacher among them. For
who is able with more dexteritie, &amp;
with greater profite, to preach of the
grace and mercy of God, then hee
who hath found it in experience him
ſelfe? For he who hath not any time
taſted how gracious the Lord is, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
be a ſufficient Preacher of his mercy.
Wherefore it is neceſſarie, that he, in
whom hath bin kythed the example
of mercy, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat his experience
with others. For no man getteth the
grace of God onelie to himſelfe, but
vnto others, that others may become
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:10992:109"/>
ter by that grace. So Chriſt ſaith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
PETER, <hi>When thou art converted,
ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

nature of faith, that it ſtretcheth out
the hand to ill men, for this end, that
if it be poſſible, al may be ſaved. <hi>Paule</hi>
when hee pleaded his cauſe before
King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> after that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed
the ſtorie of his life, having
forgotten himſelf, vn-mindful of his
bands, and turning vnto King <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi>
hee was altogether occupyed in
this, that hee might bring the man
vnto the faith: <hi>Beleeueſt thou not the
Prophets</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>King</hi> Agrippa?
<hi>I know</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>that thou beleeueſt.</hi>
Then <hi>Agrippa</hi> anſwered, <hi>almoſt thou
perſwadeſt mee to become a Chriſtian.</hi>
PAVLE replyeth again, <hi>I would to God,
that not onely thou, but alſo all that heare
mee to daye, were both almoſt, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſuch as I am, except thoſe bandes.</hi>
What then? Thought alſo PAVLE
himſelf to be bleſſed, far beyond that
King? Surely thoſe who hath once
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:10992:109"/>
taſted the ſweetneſſe of the grace of
God which is in Ieſus Chriſt, thoſe
alſo eſteeme the Kings of this world,
whom they ſee to be out of chriſt, to
be vnhappy, in reſpect of themſelues
although they themſelues appeare to
be moſt miſerable, not only to kings,
but alſo to the whole worlde. When
therefore PAVLE deſired <hi>Agrippa</hi> to
be like vnto himſelfe; who, ſeeing he
was without Chriſt, out of all doubt
he thought ſo great a King, in regard
of himſelfe, to be vnhappie and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
which thinge, whiles hee
thought vpon, pittying him, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out his hande as it were, would
haue led the man vnto Chriſt, he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
that, I ſaye, pittying him. For the
faithfull and godlie alone, who them
ſelues haue felte in experience, the
mercie of God, are vnfainedly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull.
For <hi>Agrippa</hi> pyttied not ſo
PAVLE, whom notwithſtanding hee
judged at that time to be miſerable,
whom he ſaw bound and layd open
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10992:110"/>
to all the injuries of his enemies.
Therefore to ſpeake at once, that is
ſeene to bee true, yea, and it were no
more, but this one example, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of the godlye, ſeeketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much, as the ſalvation and
converſion of miſerable men. For
what? Thou which ſtandeth in grace
thinkeſt thou not but that it may be,
that ſome of thy grace may be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
if thou communicate not the
ſame liberally with others? Feele
wee not that in experience, that this
communicating ſerveth chiefely for
this, to increaſe faith &amp; grace? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it came to paſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

For hee ſpeaketh by experience; for
hee himſelfe had ſometime by-paſte
waxed brutiſh; And therefore hee
ſpeaketh vnto ſuch, in theſe wordes,
as hee was in time paſt himſelfe, as if
he ſhould ſaye. O miſerable men, be

&amp; he confirmeth the faithfull by

then before the minds of the ſenſeles
men, the eſtate both of the faithful &amp;
of the vnfaithfull: yea, &amp; with ſuch a
weight of words, that if it be poſſible
he may once ſhake off from them that
ſenſleſnes. Marke here firſt, DAVID
himſelf being delivered from this be

preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly beholdeth thoſe which ſleep
ſoundly as it were in ſin, having loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

miſerable, yea, hee thinketh no more
of them nor of horſes &amp; mules. The
godlie fra once they haue awakened
out of ſinne, and their eyes are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
then looking vppon them,
whome you may ſee everie-where
to be caſt vp in a deep ſleep, yea, that
they are not able to bee awakened
by anie afflictions out of that deepe
ſleepe of ſecuritie, they eſteeme no
more of them, then of vn-dantoned

And ſurely in very deed
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10992:114"/>
except they repent, they are in worſe
caſe, then the beaſts themſelues, who
ſoever finallie they be. Men that are

It may be indeed, that they may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

But, except in time they be awakened

not choſen indeed many wiſe men,
not many mightie, not many noble;

grace, for that ende eſpeciallie, that
fleſh ſhould not glorie in the ſelf, but
ſhould acknowledge what ſo ever

that he took purpoſe to driue

in the fourth verſe. <hi>I ſpak with my)</hi>
That is, I murmured againſt God. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the three cauſes of going aſtray go
before. The firſt is in this place, as if
he ſhould ſay, When there was none
end of afflictiones, my ſorrowe as a
wound waxed greene: The ſecond is
in the beginning of the next verſe. <hi>My
minde growing hoate within mee]</hi> The
third is the ſeconde parte of the verſe
following, as if he ſhould ſaye, With
often meditation and thought, mine
affection was kindled vppe, and was
as it were, altogether ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
in flamed. DAVID manyfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
this extreame greate perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:10992:119"/>
of minde, When TZIBA ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching,
hee accuſed his maiſter
MAPHIBOSHETH, as one aſpyring
to the kingdome falſelie. 2. Samuel.
16. 1. Marke, of all theſe thinges,
Firſt, DAVID tooke purpoſe to bee
patiente, and hee begouth to put in
practiſe his purpoſed adviſe, but hee
wente backe from execution. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
of the grace, that wee take
purpoſe to doe the thinge that is
good: It commeth from the grace
of GOD, that wee beginne to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
out, the good thinge that wee
haue decreed: But ſcarſe haue wee
begunne, but if wee be left of GOD
(ſuch is the weakneſſe of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
we preſentlie fall awaie. Where
fore wee haue neede of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
grace of GOD all our lifelong
and in all the actiones of our life, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
it is not poſſible that wee
can perſever to the ende. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that is to bee marked, that DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID
entred not in raſhlie into thie
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:10992:120"/>
this way of ſilence and patience, but
he did this adviſedly, that is, having
firſt taken counſel there anent. Who
ſoever therefore will patiently driue
over this life, and liue wel every way,
he ought to obliſh himſelfe as it were
to doe this thing, by a ſure determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of his mind, and haueing had
deliberation thereof before. For this
thing ſerveth eſpecially againſt thoſe
ſuddaine motions of the minde: For
you may ſee, many caried violently
hither and thither in an inſtant with
their owne affectiones. The cauſe is,
that they never yet decreed with
themſelues, to driue over their life
patiently: From whence it came to
paſſe, that if they bee mooved, yea,
with the leaſt trifling thing, preſently
their tongue is lowſed to reproches,
and their hande is enarmed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſum haynous wicked fact. Men
commonlie thinke that it is not the
parte of a couragious mind, to ſuffer
wrong, neither yet thinke they, that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:10992:120"/>
they are men of Spirite, vnleſſe they
be tranſformed into beaſts. Surely I
judge, that none of thoſe men were
ſtronger in Spirit then DAVID, or
greater in heart, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
decreed with his owne mind to
ſuffer all kinde of injuries. This is the
verie beaſtlie fearcenes of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
men, &amp; not any courage of mind.
Thirdly, it is to be obſerved, that DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDs
affection at laſt boyled-vp, and
that he himſelfe ſpake at length: For
ſuch is the force of our affectiones,
that violently they draw the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
hither and thither. Of which it is
that you yet perceiue, ſome remane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of ſinne ſtill to remaine in every one
of the beſt men: and that this perfect
regeneration of the Papiſtes, is but a
dreame. Surely I beleeue, that theſe
men never yet ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly went down
into themſelues, and haue never ſeen
that vyle corruption, that lyeth far
ben in the heart. <hi>I know</hi> (ſayeth the
Apoſtle) being now regenerate, <hi>that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:10992:121"/>
in me,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <hi>that is in my fleſh, no good dwelleth</hi>
He indeed felt that bitterneſſe of ſin
cleauing faſt to the ribbes, and that
law, which he calleth, <hi>The law of the
members, rebelling againſt the law of the
Spirite:</hi> which indeed thoſe men haue
never yet felte nor would not feele.
Fourthly, it is to bee noted, that DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID
gaue not place incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto
his affection: for you ſee here that he
burſted foorth into theſe voyces, by
certaine degrees. For afflictions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vppon vs dailie, firſt of all, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
like a wounde waxeth greene,
then the hart groweth hoate: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the fyre kindleth vp, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
the tongue is lowſed. Learne
therefore, that the affectiones of the
renewed man burſt not foorth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome wraſtling, whereby indeed
the regenerat man differeth from the
vnrenewed, which eaſilie, yea with
any light motion, is brought on to
commit any thing, and from hence
proceedeth alſo another difference
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:10992:121"/>
betuixt the renewed man, &amp; the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate.
The regenerate man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
ſuffereth greatly, &amp; for a long
time, wronges and afflictiones: IOB
took in patience the los of his goods,
he ſuffereth alſo patiently, the tinſell
of his children, but when it came to
boyles in his owne bodie, hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not thoſe with ſo patient a mind.
Notwithſtanding, that mans woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
patience, is recommended to
the whole poſteritie, But he which is
not renewed, ſuffereth nothing with
a willing minde, if he be not able to
revenge wronges when hee woulde,
notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he reteineth with in
himſelfe an intention of vengeance.
Fiftly, it is to be marked, DAVID kind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
vp firſt, then he ſpake:<note place="margin">Iame. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hart, ther is no flamme in the tongue:
<hi>That thing which defyleth the man</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

thoſe blaſphemies, reproches, and

mens tongues, but if wee were able
once to ſee thoſe fowle and filthie
hearts of men, which God alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth,
howe greatly I praye you,
would we altogether abhorre them?
For there is nothing more deteſtable
to the godlie man, then is the ſoule

ſame vanity to be of mens careful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours,
which is of the men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
as if hee ſhould ſaye: They la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
runne &amp; ſweat in vaine, which
thing he himſelfe had before founde
in experience, who after he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
with ſo great travell, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and ſo great riches, he ſaw <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchalom</hi>

that <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
ſome thing againſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and therefore hee was vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
whether he ſhould haue his ſon
to be his ſucceſſor, or any other who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
Mark firſt: DAVID, his tongue
being now lowſed, he inveighed not
preſently againſt <hi>Abſchalom,</hi> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> nor againſt any
man whoſoever: But turning vnto
God, he murmureth againſt him. For
we are al of that diſpoſition, and that
is the nature of our affectiones, that
aſſoone as they are lowſed, then they
begin firſt to be caried head long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God: which thing, theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies,

many blaſphemies of miſerable men;
ſo many paſſionat out cryings &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
not ſo much againſt man
as thoſe gods, whom they fayned to
themſelues. There ſurely it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vive repreſentation of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature of all men; in the meane
time, they ſuffer all ſortes of extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:
For wee all by nature, impute
the afflictions which befall vs, &amp; our
miſeries to God, &amp; not to our ſelues,
or to our ſinnes. Notwithſtanding,
this murmuring of DAVID, neither
that impatience of IOB, is altogether
deſperate, ſuch as vſeth to be of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
men, and whom God leaveth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
by his Spirite. Marke next,
The argument of the petition, from
the ſhortnes of the life, he gathereth
that we muſt die. It is profitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
continually to thinke of the
ſhortneſſe of this life, and not to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
our heart againſte afflictiones,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:10992:125"/>
whereby we are exerciſed in this life,
according to the will of God. So IA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COB

                        <hi>That his daies were ſhort and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:</hi>
But we muſt not alway gather of
this, that wee muſt die, neither yet
through impatience, is death to bee
thirſted after: which thing DAVID did
at ſome times, through the weaknes
of the fleſh. But PAVLE ſheweth a far
diverſe vſe of oppreſſion. <hi>Affliction
bringeth not out impatience,</hi>

Thou ſeeſt therefore, that impatience

the ſenſe of afflictiones, but patience
and hope. Of the which againe, you
gather, after what maner the corrupt
nature of man, abuſeth good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

Alſo, there is ſome meaſure of

in that eſtate which DAVID then was
in, had gone further on, &amp; not onely
would hee haue earneſtlie deſired

had put hand in himſelfe: yet God
leaveth not his own altogether. Third<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie

as if he ſhould ſaye: Therefore leaue
off from afflicting mee longer and
more grieuouſlie, that I may refreſhe
my ſelfe before I die, not being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
againe vnto this life. So doth
IOB diſpute, 10. 21. &amp;c. and as a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſuppliant is turned to God. <hi>When
I goe not away]</hi> Theſe words declare
the ſhortneſſe of this preſent life, as
if he ſhould ſay, ſo long as the ſhorte
light continueth, or, ſo long as I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
this ſhorte light. And this is the
ſelfe-ſame argument in effect with
that, which was in the ende of the
verſe preceding. Out of thoſe things
which we haue ſpoken, marke firſt in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:10992:129"/>
DAVID a certain memorable change
and prayers, greatly diſagreeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelues. Before indeed he
had prayed with a troubled minde,
but nowe hee prayeth with a more
quiet and ſetled hart. For ſometimes
the fleſhe hath more the rule in the
prayers of the faithful, then the Spirit
oft-times. And ſome times again, the
rule of the Spirit, is more then of the
fleſh. Thou haſt alſo in this change,
an inſtruction of the finall victory of
the holy Spirite. For although in this
preſent life, the victorie appeareth to
be oft vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fleſhes ſide; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
by that ſame thinge, that after the
motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fleſh, the holy Spirit rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
vp in vs that operation, which
ſuppeth vp, as it were the motion of
the Spirite; we are put in minde that
once the victorie, ſhal be perfect and
full vpon the Spirites ſides. More o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conſidder, how diverſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, how
contrary to the ſelfe, the effect of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
is in DAVID. For ſeeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:10992:129"/>
when affliction draue him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to mourning, now the feeling
of the ſame, provoketh him to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
of ſin, and to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation
of the puniſhment therof.
For what is all our nature, if at anie
time wee be oppreſſed with adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
then wee are wearied of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
life, and wee crie for death. But
wee are admoniſhed rather, to ſeeke
the forgiuenes of ſinnes, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with GOD, through Ieſus
Chriſt, then death, ſeeing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
the affliction is not to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with death; but it ſhal be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
manie waies, if through Ieſus
Chriſt there bee not reconciliation.
Finally obſerue, how diverſelie hee
doth conclude from the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
taken from the ſhortneſſe of
this life. For before, becauſe the life
is ſhorte, hee earneſtlie ſought for
death. Now, becauſe the life is ſhort,
he prayeth that the plague may bee
remooved. He vſeth the argument of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:10992:130"/>
the Spirite aright, which the fleſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth;
and he draweth out holy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiones
and concluſiones out of the
ſame principles, out of the which, the
fleſh draweth out venime. The rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
men foeleth in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues this
contrarie maner of reaſoning &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
out of the ſame principles.
Yea, and they are happie in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
that thereafter they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
out of good principles, evill
thinges; out of the ſame againe they
haue gathered good things, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to witte, overcomming the fleſh:
when the vngodly and vnrenewed,
continuallie, if at any time it happen
them to ſee good grounds, draw out
of them falſe and vngodly concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
For it is ſaide, <hi>That the vngodlie
knowing God, notwithſtanding they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
him not as GOD, but they became

deſire of the viſible preſence of
God, which at that time was in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.
The other, an exceeding great
ſorrow of hearte, conjoyned with an
earneſt deſire. The deſire is firſt ſet
downe by waye of compariſon, the
ſimilitude being made with an hart
braying. <hi>The heart</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>brayeth
no more for the channels of waters, then I
bray vnto thee, ô God)</hi> The heart is then
ſaid to fly at al times vnto the waters,<note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the heart.</note>
when painefully he draweth breath,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:10992:131"/>
which is chiefely, when the harveſt
quarter beginneth, at what time, in
reſpect of the burning heate, hee is
moſt impatient of thirſt: So are wee
all by nature thirſtie and drîe, and
when there is a feeling of that thirſte
and drough, then with no leſſe deſire
are we caried forwarde vnto Chriſt,
in whom only wee haue our refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then the heart brayeth, that is,
crying out, he runneth vnto the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
wherby he quencheth his thirſt,
Then is ſet down a ſimple propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of that deſire: <hi>My ſoule is thirſty
for God]</hi> (ſayeth he) By nature al men
as wee haue ſaide, are drie and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
burnt vp, to witte, with that fyre
of ſinne, and of the wrath of GOD.
But fewe feele their drough, where
by it commeth to paſſe, yea, that few
are mooved with the thirſt of grace,
for no man is throughly touched
with the thirſte of the grace of God,
except God firſt by his Spirite hath
provoked him, eſpeciallie by the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:10992:132"/>
preaching of the law. But now, when
once it is provoked, except newgrace
follow on, whereby the thirſty are
continually led forward, to that pure
fountaine of the water of life, Ieſus
Chriſt, preſently they wil ſeek vnto
themſelues fowle puddles; and for
cleane and living water, they will
drink in filthie &amp; ſtinking waters: for
the only merite of Ieſus Chriſt and
his bloud, they wil drinke vp the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of men: &amp; ſuch poyſons, which
the Papiſtes this day, offer to miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men. Wherefore Chriſt in IOHN,
at what time he remained vppon the
earth with the Iewes, with a loude
voyce and crie, he called al that were
thirſtie vnto himſelf. And this whole
Preaching of the Goſpell this day, it
belongeth to no other end, then that,
as with the finger, that only fountain
of life Ieſus Chriſt, be pointed clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
out. Nowe after that men are
brought vnto Chriſt, they drink, yea,
they drink for evermore, they drink
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:10992:132"/>
in that grace which is in him, &amp; they
all receiue of his fulneſſe: for that
fountaine of life, is never drawen
drye, neither yet doth ever the blood
of Chriſt drie vp: But not without
ſome difference, drinke wee in this
life, and in the life to come: For in
this life (that I ſpake ſo) we taiſt but a
little, but in the other life, wee ſhall
drinke that water of life abundantly.
Wee ſhal drinke then for evermore,
and we ſhall drinke without loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe,
and preaſe of vomiting:
For like as that water, can never at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time be drawen drie, ſuch is the
plentie and abundance thereof; ſo it
is of that dulceneſſe and ſweetneſſe,
that it allureth and provoketh the
drinkers to drink continually. There
is no pleaſure in this life, which by
continuall vſe thereof, breedeth not
a loathſomeneſſe of the ſelfe. Wee
loath at ſometimes, I grant, thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
of godlines; as the preaching
and hearing of the worde, prayers, &amp;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:10992:133"/>
ſuch other of like ſort. But this is not
to bee imputed to this water, but to
our corruption: For there lurketh as
yet in everie one of our hearts, ſome
gall of bitternes, whereby our mind
is ſo infected, and the taſte in the
mouth is ſo corrupt, that thoſe things
which are by nature moſt ſweete, at
ſometime they ſeeme to bee bitter:
Which thing is manifeſt, yea, out of
that, that in that other life, when wee
ſhall haue layde downe, this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of nature, there ſhall bee no loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all. Beſide this difference,
whereof wee haue ſpoken, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
wherby we drink in this life,
and ſhal drink in that other to come.
In that other life we ſhall drinke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlie,
that is, no midde inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
comming betweene, either of the
preached word, or of the ſacraments
adminiſtred, we ſhal ſee God even as
he is. But in this life, ſurely wee haue
need of meanes, as it were of ſpowts,
whereby may bee convoyed out of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:10992:133"/>
Chriſt vnto vs, that water of grace.
And this is it which the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:<note place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of this it commeth to paſſe, that as

there is a deſire of the meanes

there is a deſire of this outwarde mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie:
And this was that longing of
DAVID, which he openeth vp in this
Pſalme: But thou wilt ſpeare; Had
not DAVID God preſent with him,
in whatſoever place it happened him
to be, without that externall miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
had he him not with him, I ſaye?
I anſwere, that he had in every place
God, in ſome meaſure preſente: but
he felt not ſo abounding an fruition
of his preſence, when he was farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the Temple of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hee was woont to feele in the viſible
Church of God, and in that Temple
which at that time had eſpeciallie a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:10992:134"/>
promiſe of Gods preſence: The ſelfe
ſame thing alſo, all the Godlie feele
in themſelues, that they feele not ſo
plentifull an enjoying of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the word Preached, or by the
Sacraments adminiſtred, which they
are accuſtomed to feele otherwiſe

GOD in vaine. <hi>For the ſtrong God]</hi>
Theſe are the groundes and cauſes
of ſuch a great deſire. DAVID had felt

through the ſame Chriſt, everlaſting
life. From this aroſe, that deſire of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying

in ſome ſure manner, viſible in his

Here DAVIDS ſoule declareth his

the ſelfe ſpeaking, by taking on the
perſon of one that ſpeaketh, and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vnto God, for while wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
and lamente, not onely the
mouth of the bodie is to be brought
out, but the ſoule is to bee brought

there be not in it a ſolide joye. But if

was indeede ſufficient matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
in that, that he was deſtitute
of that viſible preſenſe of God in his
Church, but for this cauſe ſorrowe
was heaped vpon ſorrow, in reſpect,
it was objected by his enemies, by
way of mockage, that he himſelf was
left of GOD. This is no new thinge
with the perſecutors of the Church,
throwen downe and humbled, yea,
this waie to vp-brayde any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

In which it is ſaide of the Church:
<hi>When we ſate weeping at the rivers of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.</hi>
But what did the Babylonians
then in that mourning: <hi>They required</hi>

ſuch as wee had ſunge in Ieruſalem.
This ſame thinge alſo ſhall wee feele
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:10992:136"/>
in experience, if ever it come to paſſe,
through the righteous judgement of
God, that wee be ſpoyled of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God in his Goſpel; the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of which evill, now appeareth
to be ſome-what light: But after that
it commeth to paſſe, through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
judgement of God, then in very
deede, wee ſhall finde in experience,
how grievous it is: I ſpeake of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
who ſometime delighteth in

theſe things]</hi> Again he ſetteth
downe his griefe, and hee conjoyneth
therewith a new argument of ſorrow.
<hi>I powre out my ſoule vpon my ſelfe]</hi> As if
he ſhould ſaye, Not onelie I powre
out teares, but I powre out the verie
ſoule, which with diſpleaſure melteth
within me. The inward louſing of the
ſoule, and of the affection thereof, is
the cauſe that the bodie and the eies,
are reſolved into teares: And manie
times, yea, our eies are not indeed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
of power to furniſh teares to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:10992:137"/>
our heavineſſe, after that till all the
teares are powred out, and the bodie
as it were dryed vp. Then the paſſion
of ſorrow vſeth to be vehement, when
it is left to the owne libertie. He adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the cauſe of ſo great a ſorrow.
<hi>Remembring theſe things]</hi> (ſayeth he) to

(ſayeth hee) <hi>to paſſe by in the multitude]</hi>
As the remembrance of the former
miſerie, after a deliverance, is conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with gladneſſe (for that man never
rejoyced ſolidely at any time, which
was not firſt before diſpleaſed in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt)
ſo the remembrance of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſte
felicitie, after that anye hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie

ſeeing it is cuſtomable in any other
thing what ſoever, it hath chiefelie
place in matters Spiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For to him it ſeemeth to be intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,

if any externall affliction for

Then next to God, the fountaine of al

were again, his ſoule out of the helles:
For it was very greatly caſt downe, as
the words themſelues ſhew. For this is
the cuſtom of the godlie, that after for

as it were: Receiue not comforte, but
drinke in ſorrow as water (for in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

hope in God, altogether after the ſame
faſhion, whereby mothers, after they
haue ſharpely rebuked their children
comfort them. It is to be marked, that
<hi>David</hi> lifteth vp his ſoule vnto hope:

in affliction proceedeth both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
from God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 23.</note> together with the
trouble he ſendeth comfort, with the
tentation, hee ſendeth deliverie out
of tentation. Neuertheleſſe, there is
ſome difference in the order, for firſt in
deede he afflicteth ere he comforteth:
Firſt is the ſenſe of trouble, then the
feeling of comfort, to what purpoſe is
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:10992:143"/>
that? To witt, becauſe we are ſo dull of
nature, and ſenſeleſſe in this life, that
we cannot eſteem of the grace of God
in Chriſt, howe great it is, neither yet
can we judge how ſweete it is, vnleſſe
wee feele firſt, how miſerable wee our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues
are by nature, and ſigh vnder the
burden of ſinne. Now in miſerie the
feeling of grace &amp; of that preſence of
God in Chriſt is ſweete. But after this
life the joy of the Godly ſhal be ſolide
wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting altogether al feling of ſorrow;
to wit, when all teares ſhall be wiped
away from our eies: for then wee ſhall
bee able to comprehend that pure and
ſincere ioy, which we cannot compas
in this life. <hi>[I will continue in my prayer]</hi>
This is the effect of the thinges precee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding:
For in reſpect that God wil ſend
away his louing kindeneſſe in the day,
and his ſong in the night vnto DAVID:
Therefore he wil continue in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to GOD. For there is no man that
is able to conceiue prayers, vnles God
furniſh the matter of them, and indue
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:10992:144"/>
vs with a feeling of his mercie. Lord
(ſayeth he) in the 51. Pſalme 17. verſe
<hi>[Thou ſhalt open my lippes, and my mouth
ſhall ſhew foorth thy praiſe]</hi> Hee calleth
God the <hi>Fountaine of his life]</hi> by which
name, he ſheweth manifeſtlie, that hee
hath apprehended that power of God
which is in Chriſt, which ſerueth vnto
life. But let vs conſider the forme of
the prayer it ſelfe. <hi>I ſay vnto the ſtrong, of
my rocke]</hi> that is of my refuge, &amp;c. This
praier of DAVID is a lamentation, and
a certaine complainte. Obſerue then
what ſort of ſongs God vſeth to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
in afflictiones, to wit, a complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kinde and ſorrowfull. And ſurelie
of neceſſitie it muſt bee thus. For to
what purpoſe ſerue ioyfull ſonges in
miſeries? looke Pſalme. 137. In which
the Church of God abhorreth thoſe
ioyful ſonges, ſuch as ſhee ſong ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
in Ieruſalem, being now in her
baniſhment. Notwithſtanding the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
and lamentation is alwaye tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with a certaine ſweetneſſe, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:10992:144"/>
ioy in God, and the lowder the ſighes
are, the deeper vſeth the reioycing to
be. But let vs conſider the words. <hi>Why
forgetteſt thou me?]</hi> (ſayeth he) Firſt he
complaineth that God forgetteth him:
Then he complaineth of his miſerie
This latter indeede is the effect of the
former. For when God forgetteth vs,
then at that time we are miſerable, we
walke as in mourning apparell, and we
quarrell with God. Alſo in the meane
time that DAVID complaineth that
the Lord had forgotten him, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him, <hi>The ſtrong GOD of his rocke]</hi>
Whereby is ſignified, that yet he clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vnto God verie grippingly. The
faithfull ſo in loue imbrace their God,
that although hee ſeeme ſome-time to
be forgetful of them, nevertheles they
leaue not off to ſtick vnto him: <hi>Howbeit</hi>
(ſayeth IOB) <hi>thou wouldeſt ſlay me, ſhould
I not hope in thee?</hi> Which thing ſurely
is an evident, that God in very deede
forgetteth them not, although for a
time he appeare ſo vnto them. For if
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:10992:145"/>
God once forget vs, and ſhould leaue
vs altogether,<note place="margin">Example in Iob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chap. 13. 15.</note> ſurely wee alſo ſhould
forſake him. For if hee firſt tooke not
hold vpon vs, verely, we were not able
with our hand, as it were, to take holde
of him. Notwithſtanding, it appeareth
ſo vnto vs, while wee are afflicted, that
we are left of him, and that hee taketh
no further thought of vs. <hi>Wherefore goe
I in mourning]</hi> Hee complayneth of
his miſerie, which he ſignifieth by the
adjunct clothing of his bodie: <hi>Becauſe
of the oppreſsion]</hi> He ſheweth the cauſe
of his miſerie, and of that dooleful ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
of clothing: To witte, the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the enemie. <hi>They invade my
bones]</hi> In theſe wordes, hee expreſſeth
more particularly this oppreſſion. <hi>They
aſſayle my bones]</hi> Then opening vp that
figuratiue ſpeech: <hi>Mine enemies repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
mee]</hi> (ſayeth hee:) The reaſon
wherefore then next hee rendreth,
from their contumelious and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
wordes, <hi>While they ſay</hi> (ſayth he)
vnto me daylie, <hi>Where is thy God?]</hi> This
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:10992:145"/>
indeed was a blaſphemie againſt God,
which was a contumelie &amp; a reproch
againſt <hi>Dauid.</hi> For blaſphemie againſt
God, is the reproch of the neighbour,
&amp; they are no otherwaies commoved
therewith, then if they were ſtricken
through with a ſworde: for ſuch is
the mutuall conjunction of God, and
of his owne; ſuch is the compaſſion, &amp;
mutual feeling, that if they ſee God to

his name to be blaſphemed, the godly
are no otherwaies commooved, then

heed; from the weightines of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:10992:147"/>
he is to ſpeake of wiſedome of all
ſortes, and manifold prudence: This
in the 5. verſe, thereafter in one word,
he calleth it a <hi>Parable,</hi> becauſe, to wit,
he ſetteth it down in his own example.
He calleth it alſo a <hi>harde matter,</hi> that is,
a notable figuratiue ſentence: For the
Hebrewes call the allegorie, that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cleare or obſcure, a darke matter.
Againe, to the ende hee may the more
mooue them to attendance, hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that he wil beearneſtly occupyed
in entreating of this matter. <hi>My mouth,</hi>
(ſayeth hee) <hi>ſhall ſpeake, and my minde
ſhall meditate, my eare ſhall inclyne the ſelf,
and my harpe ſhall be played vpon.]</hi> See
here, firſt, he requireth attendance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the parte of other men, in the
meane time, hee declareth that he dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie
and earneſtly entreates of the
matter. Firſt, then obſerue when there
is any graue matter propounded to be
handled, both he that heareth, and hee
that ſpeaketh, ſhould be very earneſtly
occupyed therein. Note againe, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10992:147"/>
of the Pſalme is of wiſedome,
as wee haue in the Preface it ſelfe.
Now that is that Wiſedome, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of confidence, as it followeth
there-after. Then beeing about to
ſpeake of confidence, hee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that all men take diligent heede,
and giue attendance to the ſame. The
doctrine of Confidence; when-ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is propounded, it ſhould not
bee layde out to the deafe, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requireth
the taking heede of all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ignoble, rich, &amp; poor: Of the great
men (I ſay) and rich, leaſt they ſhould
put their confidence in their nobilitie
and riches: and of the ignoble and
poore, leaſt being deſtitute of thoſe
things, they caſte away their courage,
yea, or commend them over-much in
others. For ſuch is the inclination of
our nature. The poore commonlie
place happineſſe in riches, Ignoble &amp;
baſe men, in honours, whereof they
themſelues are deſtiture. Thirdly, hee
profeſſeth, that he will be all waies oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:10992:148"/>
in handling of this matter. For
what is it chiefely, that ſtirreth vp at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
in men, that are of contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions?
Even the ſerious diligence of
the teacher. And when is the hearer
chiefely edified? Even then, to witte,
when hee diligentlye marketh thee
ſpeaker, And profiteth alſo by him,
that hee ſpeaketh nothing but that
wherevpon he hath meditated before,
and inclyneth his eare as it were to his
own voyce: For although, he pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
not other things with his mouth,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which he hath before thoght
vpon in his minde: Notwithſtanding,
the ſelfe ſame thinges being firſt vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the mouth, &amp; then vnderſtoode
by the eare, and finally, returning vnto
the minde from whome they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
they confirme the faith &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the ſpeaker himſelfe. And thus
much haue we ſpoken, concerning the
Preface.</p>

is, in the 6. v. The ſum of the
propoſition is, confidence in GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all evils, aſwell of this life, as of
that, that is to come: He propoundeth
not this ſimplie, but having wraſtled
as it were a little, with the infirmitie of
his fleſh, he vttereth it out with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation:
<hi>Why ſhuld I feare</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>in the times of evil, that the iniquitie, &amp;c]</hi>
That is, that through the infirmitie of
this my life, in which I walke as it were
with my feet, I be circumveened with
calamities, and ſo I be in an evill caſe.
This ſpeech appeareth to be of a man,
reaſoning with another, and rebuking,
and ſo it commeth to paſſe indeed in
the very matter it ſelf. For <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
theſe thinges out, not without a

the weakneſſe of the fleſh: For wee get
not libertie, through the fleſh, without

in God. And our confidence in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:10992:149"/>
God is perpetually hindred by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities

                        <hi>OF thoſe men]</hi> Here followeth the
argument of confidence, from the
riſing againe of the fleſh, and life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.
<hi>For,</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>he will redeeme
my ſoule foom the graue]</hi> Hee thinketh it
not ſufficient to lay this argument na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
downe, but hee premitteth the
amplifying thereof, from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which, to wit, falleth out to them,
who place their confidence in riches,
and honoures. For there is none of
them who is able to redeeme his ſoule
from death. This amplification and
declaration, to the ende wee may the
more clearely vnderſtande it, ſhall bee
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10992:150"/>
deduced into thoſe partes. Firſt, in the
ſeaventh verſe, and thereafter vnto the
eleventh verſe, he ſheweth, that he that
putteth his confidence in riches, is not
able to deliuer a ſoule from death.
Then next he ſheweth, that he which
putteth his truſt in honour, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
a ſoule from death, from the
11. verſe, to the 14. verſ. Thirdly, while
he conſidereth theſe things earneſtly,
hee aggregeth the fooliſhnes of thoſe
men, as alſo he rebuketh the fooliſhnes
of the poſteritie, in the 14. and 15. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
I returne to the firſt parte. <hi>Of theſe</hi>
(ſayth he) <hi>who truſt in their wealth. &amp;c.]</hi>
None there is, who is able to deliver
with all his riches, not ſo much indeed
as his brothers life, let bee his owne
life: (for a man will redeeme his owne
life with a greater price, then his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
<hi>So that he may liue for euer, and not
find in experience corruption]</hi> And in the
ninth verſe, the reaſon is inſerte: <hi>For</hi>
(ſayeth hee) <hi>the redemption of their life
is deare]</hi> Yea, certainly the price of life
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:10992:150"/>
can at no time bee payed by them to
GOD. And this is the thing which
he ſubjoyneth, <hi>Yea, it ceaſeth for ever]</hi>
The ſumme of all tendeth to this: as if
he ſhould ſay, he who placeth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in riches, hee cannot indeede
by his wealth ſo much as redeeme
the life of his brother, let bee his owne
life. Mark: <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh not after this
maner: He who putteth his truſt in his
welth, knoweth not what the inconſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy
of the world is, how long he is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
that wealth; but giuing that he had
ſufficient portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of riches in this whol
life, notwithſtanding he affirmeth that
hee is not able beyonde that moment
appoynted for death to protract this
life, or to giue immortalitie to anye
mortall man. DAVID then for this
cauſe eſtemeth verie litle of riches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they cannot make a man immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
he regardeth immorality ſo much.
It cannot be ſaid, how farre the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the men of this worlde differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from this ſentence of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Theſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:10992:151"/>
men knowe indeed, that neither rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
nor honoures are able to giue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie:
Notwithſtanding, taking
no thought of immortalitie, they place
their whole truſt in thoſe things. And
ſome are ſo prophane, that they are not
aſhamed to ſay, If they be in a good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
in this life, they little regarde that
life to come. But others, if they dare
not be ſo bold to caſt out ſo prophane
a ſpeach, neuertheleſſe they ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
ſhew in their life &amp; manners, that they
thinke the ſame thinge in their hearts.
Man in the firſt creation was made for
immortality,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 5.</note> yea, &amp; there is in him by
nature it ſelfe ſome feeling and deſire
of immortalitie. Then I reckon this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
the extreeme greateſte curſes,
that any man ſhall become ſo brutiſh,
that all his life long he ſhall thinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of immortalitie. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
you ſhall ſee euerie where many
ſuch, not ſo much men, as wild beaſtes,
hauing nothing of mans nature in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
except the outward ſhew, yea, who are
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10992:151"/>
worſe then the verie wild beaſtes. For
the wilde beaſtes reteine their owne
nature, but thoſe degende from their
owne naturall. But, what will you ſay,
ar riches ſo great enemies and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to that life to come? Are not rather
all thoſe temporal goods, as many ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
pennies of that life and felicitie to
come? I anſwer. I ſay that riches ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
abroad, rather then gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by hook &amp; crooke are more pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable
to eternal life. For where a mans
treaſure is gathered together, there is
his heart. But the riches ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade,
are that true The ſaurie which
ſhall be profitable to eternall life. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
thou that a treaſure (would any
man ſay) which is ſcattered abroade?
Yea,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 10. 19.</note> ſurely, the Apoſtle calleth diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
riches, a treaſure: <hi>For if</hi> (ſayeth he)
<hi>we be ready to giue, wee ſhall lay vp for our
ſelues a good foundation for the time to
come, that we may take hold of eternall life.</hi>
You ſee, therefore that we lay vp that,
which notwithſtanding wee giue out
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:10992:152"/>
and gather that, which nevertheles we
diſperſe. <hi>Although he ſee]</hi> The ſecond
part of the amplification, whereby hee
ſheweth him, who putteth his truſt in
honour, is notable with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to redeeme his owne life. Then
he teacheth, what they get of that to
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues; they ar notable to redeeme
their ſoules although (ſayeth he) they
ſee the wiſemen of this world, none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
to periſh, then the vn-wiſe,
fooliſh and brutiſh: And that they
leaue all their riches and magnificence
to others, yea, perhaps to men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
and ſtrangers: Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
their minde is to ſeeke glorie to
themſelues, yea, and that of woorkes
builded vp here, and there gloriouſly.
<hi>Which it pleaſeth them to call after their
owne names]</hi> Then hee ſubioyneth in
the thirteenth verſe, which befalleth
thoſe ambitious men: <hi>The man who is
in honour, he ſhal receiue no further profite
of his honours, then the rich-men of their
riches]</hi> Yea ſurely, all the honours ſhal
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:10992:152"/>
not bee able to giue him the delaye of
one night: hee becommeth at laſt, like
vnto beaſtes that periſh. For even as in
his life, hee was like vnto theſe verie
beaſts, to wit, vnderſtanding nothing,
as it is ſet downe in the laſt verſe, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in his death hee ſhall bee like vnto
them.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. 18. 19.</note> For it is good reaſon, that hee
which liveth like a beaſt, ſhall alſo die
lik a beaſt. Mark here he ſaith, firſt that
he who putteth his confidence in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that is, the ambitious man ſeeth
and vnderſtandeth: Then next he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that nevertheles, his minde is to
ſeeke glorie. It profiteth nothing atall,
to ſee the thing that is good, and to be
followed, and the thing that is evill, &amp;
to be eſchewed; vnleſſe God therwith
open the heart to this ende, that the
thing which we ſee and vnderſtande,
we feele it intirely in our heart. You
will ſee every where wicked, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
covetuous, yea, and cruell men,
when they haue a thouſand ſuch moſt
dolefull experiences before their eies,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:10992:153"/>
notwithſtanding, they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
with any of thoſe thinges, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet chaunge they their mind and
purpoſe into better. And what is the
cauſe? Thoſe menne ſee well-ynough
with their minde, and do vnderſtande,
but they feele nothing in their heart.
Therefore, God is earneſtly to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto, that as there wants not exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as well good as evill of all ſorts; ſo
he would graunt vnto vs, that we may
feele intirely in our heart, &amp; that there
may bee with the knowledge of the
minde a conſcience, and a feeling of
the heart. <hi>Seeing this is]</hi> The third part
of the amplification, in the which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
while he conſidereth more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
this iſſue (for none of them,
neither the rich man, nor the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man, is able to redeeme his ſoule)
Hee aggregeth the fooliſh aſſurance
and confidence of thoſe men; yea, and
not onely of thoſe, but of the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
<hi>Seeing</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>this is their way]</hi>
And ſeeing none of them is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:10992:153"/>
his own ſoule, neither this man
by his honour, nor that man by his
wealth: notwithſtanding they waxe
ſo beaſtly, that they put their aſſurance
in thoſe things: &amp; not only do thoſe go
mad, but their poſteritie alſo approues
them as wiſe men, &amp; haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
&amp; follow their example. Thou
ſeeſt therefore the wicked, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they hurt other men while they are
aliue, but alſo they are an offence vnto
them when they are departed this life.
Theſe vayne-glorious and ambitious
men, craue this thing moſt earneſtlie,
that the deeds atchieved by them, be
liade vp in remembrance. But conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with mee, how much they profite
by this thing: what other thing I pray
you do they, then increaſe their owne
righteous condemnation? how many
mo in that reſpect, follow their wicked
example, ſo much the more grieuous
ſurely ſhal be their judgement. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt endeavour ſo to liue, that
not onely wee be not an offence to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:10992:154"/>
while wee are aliue, but alſo that
we leaue not to our poſterity after our
death, an example of an evill led-life.
This is ſpecially to bee done of them,
which are in any account or place, and
whoſe deedes done, are layde vp in
memorie to the poſteritie. <hi>Like ſheepe]</hi>
The concluſion of the amplification,
whereby hee ſheweth the miſerie of
thoſe men: That are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
their ſoule, either by wealth or
by honour: But even like ſheepe, fra
once they bee layde downe into the
graue, death ſhall eate them vppe.
And how long? To witte, while the
righteous rule over them, that is, in
Chriſt Ieſus, of whoſe kingdome the
righteous ſhall be participant. At what
time ſhall they rule? in that <hi>morning</hi>
(ſayeth he) in which, to wit, the godly
ſhall ryſe againe, as it were out of the
night, and darknes of the graue, when
the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, that is,
Chriſt Ieſus ſhall aryſe in that his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:10992:154"/>

Bot we in this place, take this word ſo,
as we judge it beſte to agree, with the
purpoſe &amp; ordour of the judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of
God; and the oppoſition following, to

the laſt of all is moſt grieuous. For firſt

them: being laid in the graue, death
eateth them down vnto the latter day;
and vnto that <hi>morning,</hi> as hee calleth it,
in which the elect and righteous ſhall
rule ouer them. Which dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhal be vnto them as it were a heauie
yoke, and ſome part of that everlaſting
puniſhment. Not-with-ſtanding the
moſt heauie puniſhment wherby they
ſhall be tormented evermore, aſwel in
bodie as in ſoule, is reſting yet. Then
let them conſider &amp; beware, (who put
their confidence more in the riches, &amp;
honours of this world, more then in
the Lord) what ende abideth that ſort
of men. And thus haue wee ſpoken
of the amplification. Now followeth
the ſixteenth verſe. The argument of
his confidence which hee ſet downe
in the ſixt verſe. Which is indeede
ſubioyned vnto the preceeding am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:10992:155"/>
by a diſſimilitude: As if he

Every ſin whatſoever is the offending

<hi>Waſh me much]</hi> Thirdly, hee repeateth
the ſame thing, as if hee ſhould ſaye,
Ceaſe not to <hi>waſh,</hi> before thou haue

it is an alluſion, to the clenſings of the

He felt, to wit, that ſinne had ſette the
rootes thereof deepely in him, and
that more toughlie it had cleaved to

him; and therefore he craveth of God
that he would multiplie the waſhings,
which, vnleſſe it be done, he thinketh
that it cannot come to paſſe, that hee
can be clenſed from the filthineſſe of

this: <hi>David</hi> vttereth the exceeding
greate dolour of his heart, in theſe his
petitions; and the cauſe of the dolours
may be ſufficiently knowen out of the
petitions themſelues. Alſo, the ſin is,
whereby hee himſelfe had grieuonſly
offended his God: For he ſayeth, <hi>Blot
out my defections &amp;c.]</hi> From whence is
manifeſtly ſene, the difference betuixt
the ſorrow of the godly; &amp; of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
Theſe laſt indeed, are ſorrowfull,
not ſo much for the ſinne,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> as for the puniſhment

<hi>Mine iniquitie, is more</hi> (ſayeth
he) <hi>then that I am able to beare.</hi> So alſo
<hi>Iudas,</hi> the betraier of Chriſt ſorrowed.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:10992:163"/>
But the godly, although indeede they
abhor the paine; notwithſtanding, for
this cauſe they are chiefly diſpleaſed,
that they haue offended their gratious
God: &amp; they deteſt ſinne, not ſo much
becauſe of the puniſhment, as for the
evil it ſelf, which is in ſin: and ſuch was
<hi>Davids</hi> ſorrow at this time. <hi>For I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my defections]</hi> Hitherto hee
hath ſought one thing thriſe, now hee
adjoyneth the cauſe of the petition fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a ſimple &amp; plaine confeſſion of ſin, as if
he ſhould ſay, O God, I confeſſe that I
haue made defectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from thee al thoſe
waies, which thou haſt manifeſted to
me by <hi>Nathan</hi> thy Prophet: I confeſſe,
(I ſay) before thy Prophet: Finally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy whole Church, not only that
which is preſent, but which ſhall bee
in times comming, to the ende of the
Worlde: That is, by writing of this
Pſalme, and declared to the whole
poſteritie and ages to come. Vppon
this followeth the Petition. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
bee mercifull vnto mee, O GOD]</hi>
                        <pb n="296" facs="tcp:10992:164"/>
Of this appeareth, that ther is no place
for grace and mercy, except a ſimple
and plaine confeſſion goe before, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the earneſt repentance
of the mind. Which is the ſame thing
which <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth, Pſal. 32. 3. and
thereafter, that which hee alſo learned
by his owne experience: <hi>When I helde
my tongue</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>and confeſſed not
my ſinne, my bones conſumed, &amp;c.</hi> And
then he addeth,<note place="margin">Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>I will make my ſin knowen

This indeede is the confeſſion: But
what followeth vpon it: <hi>Thou haſt taken
away</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>the puniſhment of my
ſinne,</hi> that is, ſin, and the puniſhment.
The ſumme of thoſe thinges tende to
this, where there is not a confeſſion,
there no grace is, where confeſſion is,
there is grace. <hi>And my ſinne]</hi> This is
the efficient cauſe of the repentance &amp;
confeſſion, an evill conſcience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the conſcience of ſinne, as if hee
ſhould ſaye; The conſcience of my ſin
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:10992:164"/>
vrgeth me day and night, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
layeth murther, adultery, &amp; other
hainous ſinnes, conjoyned with theſe,
before mine eies. Wee are prepared
therefore, to faith and repentance, by a
conſcience accuſing vs, and ſtriking a
terrour into our hearts. From thence it
is that wee haue our recourſe vnto the
grace of Chriſt, and embraceth the
ſame by faith; from faith againe, and
the feling of grace, the dolour aryſeth,
which is according to God, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God is offended, of that dolour,
againe proceedeth that chaunge of
the minde, which wee call the turning
of the mind, or repentance. For as the
Apoſtle witneſſeth:<note place="margin">2. Co. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi>The ſorrow which is
after God, cauſeth repentance vnto ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.]</hi>
Finally, from repentance &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the mind, a ryſeth the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the mouth. This thing is clearelie
ſeene of the preparation to grace,
that no man attayneth to that grace,
which is in chriſt Ieſus, by ſluggiſhnes
and ſleeping. But by horrours of the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:10992:165"/>
conſcience, they paſſe to that heavenly
joy. For although life in Chriſt be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given vnto vs, notwithſtanding, we
muſt ſuffer ſome notable alteration, &amp;
wee muſt be caſt downe, yer we be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vp, befor life be gotten. Moreover,
we learne that thing of this example of
<hi>David,</hi> how graciouſly they are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
who haue a conſcience ſomewhat
more watchfull: for firſt they are brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that they commit not many hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
ſins, which otherwaies they wold
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit: Then the ſelf ſame conſcience
if there be any evil thing done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
they are admoniſhed thereof; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
they ar thruſt forward to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
But contrariwiſe, their eſtate is
moſt miſerable, whoſe conſciencely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in a dead ſleepe: For of neceſſitie,
they muſt ruſh forwarde, nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
them into all kinde of ſinne. And
then, after any grieuous ſin is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted
of neceſſitie they muſt ſecurely ſleep
therein, nothing calling them back to
repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: wherfore the eſtate of that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:10992:165"/>
man is happie, which is touched with
a conſcience of his deeds, &amp; although
it ſeeme very oft vnpleaſant vnto vs,
that the conſcience either holdeth vs

from them, ſaying: <hi>Verely, verely,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:10992:166"/>
I ſay vnto you, in ſo far as ye haue not done
it to one of thoſe little ones, ye haue not done
it to me. David.</hi> (I ſay) goeth not about
this way to excuſe the matter, by leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his ſinne, as if it were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt God: For hee cannot
more expreſſely ſpeake, that that ſinne
was committed againſt God himſelf:
<hi>Againſt thee, againſt thee]</hi> (ſayeth hee)
<hi>I haue ſinned:</hi> Then hee aggregeth his
ſinne, when he ſayeth, <hi>That he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt God alone]</hi> If wee will ſpeake
properly, whatſoever ſorte of ſinne,
which is committed againſt God, and
reſpecteth him, either immediatly, as
when men ſinne againſt the firſt Table
of the lawe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> or immediatly, as when
they ſinne againſt the ſeconde Table.
For ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the lawe
of GOD, and the perſon offended is
God properly. For except Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
interveened not firſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forbidding or commanding any
thing, ſurely there ſhuld be no offence
againſt any creature, except God had
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:10992:166"/>
ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt not commit adulttrie,</hi> there
ſhould be none offence, neither of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIAH,
neither of any other in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Adulterie, Except God had ſaide,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not ſlay:</hi> There ſhould bee no
offenſe in ſlaying, neither againſt VRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AH,
nor againſt any other: Wherefore,
if wee will ſpeake properly, all ſinne is
committed againſt God alone. Of this,
two things do follow, the priviledge of
forgiving of ſinne, or remiſſion of ſin,
perteineth to GOD alone, for God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
if wee will ſpeake properlie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth
our ſins. The other, the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of ſin, belongeth to God alone.
<hi>Vengeance is mine</hi> (ſayth the Lord) <hi>and I
will repay:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.</note> Wherfore, when any wrong
is done to any man, the injury is not ſo
much to be thoght to be done againſt
man, as it is done againſt GOD, and to
him it ſhould be left freelie. God, if we
will ſpeak properlie, is the perſon hurt,
and offended, for ſo much as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
is broken, which verely,
if it were not broken, the creature
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:10992:167"/>
ſhould haue no cauſe to complaine of
the injurie: wherefore vengeance firſt
is to be committed vnto GOD, then
next, to that perſon to whom he hath
committed his place vppon the earth.
Notwithſtanding, men ſo handle their
own cauſe, ſo they revenge the wrongs
done vnto them, as if ſin were commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
againſt them ſelues alone, and that
the wrong, nothing perteined vnto
God. Of which, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times, that while they wil revenge
the wrong done againſt themſelues,
God revengeth himſelf vpon them, &amp;

to ſpeak ſo: and this much concerning
ſin, in ſo far as it belongeth to this place
For <hi>David</hi> leſſeneth not ſo his ſin, as if
in a part only it touched God, but hee
aggregeth the ſame, as if it were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
againſt God alone, as if he ſhould
ſay, I haue nothing to do (to ſpeak tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
with <hi>Vriah,</hi> or with any mortall
man, But with thee, O God, I haue to
doe, although all without difficultie,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:10992:167"/>
ſhould forgiue mee the offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Notwithſtanding,
by that thing I could not be ſatisfied,
my God; Becauſe, againſt thee, againſt
thee alone haue I ſinned, and except
thou, according to thy goodneſſe, for
giue me my ſinne, I accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nothing, of
al the remiſſion, of all the men in the
world, or the pardon of ſinne purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of all men. VVe are warned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by <hi>Davids</hi> example, that while
our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience accuſeth vs, it accuſeth
vs not indeede ſo much of any man
that is offended, as of that infinite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
of God, which is offended. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
conſcience accuſeth him, not ſo
much of any fact committed againſte
<hi>Vriah,</hi> as againſt God himſelfe, &amp; from
hence aryſeth, that earneſt feeling of
ſinne. From hence alſo ariſe thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of hell, while men ſee that they
haue to doe, not ſo much with men,
as with GOD himſelfe. For of all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
God is the moſt terrible enemie,
from whoſe wrath, there is but this
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:10992:168"/>
onely refuge to vs, that wee flie vnto
himſelfe, and with him be reconciled
in Chriſt: VVherefore we will get this
commoditie, out of the example of
<hi>David,</hi> that after we haue now ſinned,
wee ſhould not flie elſe where, but to
God himſelfe. For <hi>Dauids</hi> mind is not
at reſt, before that firſt hee enter in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
againe with his God. <hi>And the
thinge that is thought]</hi> As if hee ſhould
ſay,<note place="margin">A cleare confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinne.</note> I thought that I had done it ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
whatſoever thing I did, when, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
the whole matter was
done as it were before thine eies, and
as it were, thou looking on, whether it
be Adultery or man-ſlaughter, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
and vnlawfull mariage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
with the adultereſſe, either fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie,
there bee a perſeverance in all
thoſe ſinnes. <hi>David</hi> therefore nowe at
laſt ſayeth, that hee hath done al thoſe
evils in Gods owne eies, and openlie.
Men indeede thinke, that whatſoever
evill thing they doe, they do it vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of GOD, but in the owne time
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:10992:168"/>
they ſhall ſee, that God hath bene as it
were, an eie-witnes of all thoſe things.
It were beſt indeed, that they ſaw this
in time, while there is ſome place for
grace, leaſt if it bee done laiter out of
time, there bee no place left for grace.
<hi>I acknowledge that thou maiſt bee iuſtified]</hi>
He ſubjoyneth the principall ende of
the confeſſion, the glory of God: As
if he ſhould ſay, I confes this, O God,
not ſo much for mine owne cauſe, to
the end that thou ſhouldeſt haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
vppon mee, as for thy glories ſake.
<hi>That thou maiſt be iuſtified in thy ſpeeches]</hi>
That is, That thou mayſt be ſeene to be
faithfull.<note place="margin">Rmo. 3. 4.</note> For <hi>Paule</hi> attributeth to the
trueth of God, and (to ſpeake ſo) his
faithfulneſſe, this juſtifying. Therfore
bee (ſayeth he) to the end thou maieſt
ſemee to be faithfull, in this thy threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
denunced by the Prophet <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
&amp; that thou mayeſt be ſeene to be
pure, that is, righteous when thou
judgeſt, that is, when thou putteſt thy
judgement in execution, which nowe
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:10992:169"/>
before thou had threatned. Thou ſeeſt
then, by <hi>Davids</hi> example, that confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſinnes, eſpecially ſerveth for the
glory of God. For ſinne committed,
doth no more redound to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, then the ſincere and free
confeſſion of ſinne, redoundeth to his
glorie. And contrariwiſe, they who
cannot repent, with their hardneſſe &amp;
obſtinacie of minde, they diſhonour
God more, yea, then having commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the moſt grievous ſinne, they had
diſhonoured him before. For to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the heart againſt grace &amp; calling,
againſt the threatnings of God, what
other thing, I pray you is it, then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
GOD of a lie, in the meane time,
that he is calling vs vnto himſelfe, and
denuncing his judgements againſt vs?
ſurely ther can be no ſin grievoſer nor
this, which I would to God this world
would at laſte acknowledge, which
cannot repent, in reſpecte of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
thereof. <hi>Behold, I was formed in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie]</hi>
Hitherto hath bene the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:10992:169"/>
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion; now followeth
the amplification thereof, or, which is
the ſame thing, the aggravating of the
ſin: and he aggravateth the ſin by three
arguments: The firſt is, from Orginall
ſinne: The ſecond, from the nature of
God: The third, from his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
wherewith GOD had indued
him. Firſt then he ſayeth. <hi>Behold I was
formed in iniquitie]</hi> thi is the firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from that original corruption, in
which he was conceived and nuriſhed
in his mothers bellie, while he became
a perfite and rype birth, as if he ſhould
ſay: What neede I to tarrie long in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating
vnto thee this actual ſin,
as they cal it: Behold the fountain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
before thee, moſt corrupt and
filthy, the whol nature, how much ſoe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver
it be, is made vp of ſin, for the poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
out as it were with the finger vnto
GOD, the corruption of his nature,
which was in him, even from the
verie birth. <hi>I was formed in iniquitie]</hi>
that is, I was conceived in original ſin
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:10992:170"/>
in which, after that I was conceived, in
the belly of my mother, I am alone in
the ſame, ever vnto ſuch time, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a perfite birth. Hee damneth not
indeede, the naturall action of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and nuriſhing of the birth in the
wombe, as a thing vnlawful, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the law of God, ſeeing the
action it ſelfe of the owne nature is not
ſinfull. But he ſignifieth, that hee had
contracted originall ſinne, ſo long
as thoſe natural actions, and lawfull in
themſelues were accompliſhed, and
that now even from the bellie, he was
defiled with that common infection
of nature, not indeed through natures
default, ſuch as it was then firſt created
of God, but through the ſinne of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which degenered into corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Originall ſinne, that I may touch it
in few wordes; it is partly ſeene in the
guiltineſſe of that firſt ſinne, partly, in
the fault or corruption of nature. It is
ſeene indeed in the guiltineſſe, becauſe
we are guiltie of that firſt ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:10992:170"/>
For in <hi>Adam,</hi> we haue al ſinned, becaus
we were all then in his loynes: and the
ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is not ſo much to
bee accounted his, as of vs all. Alſo,
in the corruption, original ſin is ſeene,
for our whole nature, and all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of our ſoule, are corrupted and
made wicked, by that defection of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
the minde is blinded, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
perverted, the will and the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
altogether deformed. Now in
this place, we vnderſtand that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of natur, from whence ariſe thoſe
actual ſinnes, as they are called. In this
place, <hi>David,</hi> while with himſelfe hee
weigheth his owne actual ſinne; from
thence he is led forward, to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the fountaine it ſelfe, of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſinne, as they call it. For all our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
defections, they ſhould put vs
in mind, of this corrupted and defiled
nature of ours, that that being once
looked vpon, and the filthineſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
conſiddered, we may very diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
travel, that that may be purged, and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:10992:171"/>
renewed, according to the image of
God. For we ought not to be contente
with externall actions, although they
bee very excellent in outwarde ſhew,
vnleſſe in the meane time wee are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, we feele our mind continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
reformed within, and that from
our inwarde obedience, al our actions
proceed. Then <hi>David,</hi> from thence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
an occaſion to aggravate his ſinne
before God. But thoſe <hi>Libertines</hi> by this
thing, yea, they excuſe themſelues, &amp;
diminiſh their ſin, becauſe they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in originall ſin, &amp; are nuriſhed
in their mothers belly: we haue ſinned
(ſay they) but we are fleſh, what could
we do? It is mans nature to fall. In the
meane time, they meditate nothing of
repentance. But by <hi>Davids</hi> example,
we learne, that in this reſpect every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ſin whatſoever, is the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
&amp; filthie, that it proceedeth from
ſo filthy and bitter a roote. Hitherto
hath bene the argument from original
ſinne: Here followeth next, from the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:10992:171"/>
holy, pure, and ſincere nature of God
himſelfe. For he ſheweth the ſame be
the owne effect. For God delighteth
in inward truth and ſincerity, becauſe
he himſelfe is true and ſincere. <hi>Behold
thou delighteſt in truth in the reines]</hi> As
if he ſhould ſay, My GOD, thou art
holy and pure, and thou delighteſt in
holineſſe and pureneſſe of the reines,
that is, in the inward cleanneſſe. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
I haue defyled my ſelfe, &amp;
I am become vncleane: As it was done
in bringing in of the former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
ſo is it done in this likewiſe. For
this partickle <hi>[Behold]</hi> craveth atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and poynteth out with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as it were, vnto God, that his moſt
cleane &amp; ſincere nature, to the end that
God looking vpon, &amp; conſidering his
own nature, ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to <hi>Dauids</hi> ſin, it
may appear moſt grieuous &amp; filthy: for
he wil not haue any one part of his ſin
to be hid before God, thinking this to
be the only way to take away ſin, if the
whol ſin, how much ſo ever it be, be ſet
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:10992:172"/>
down together, and at one time in the
ſight of God. For ſo he is aſſured, that
it ſhall come to paſſe, that God, by that
merite and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,
ſhall cover his ſinne. For we our ſelues
ought not to cover our ſinne, But wee
ſhould in a ſincere confeſſion, ſet it
downe before the eies of GOD, that
GOD thereafter may cover the ſame.
For that at length ſinne is truely cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
when it is hid over by Chriſt from
Gods ſight. Moreover obſerue, that he
aggravateth his ſinne from Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
That the knowledge of GOD,
leadeth vs to the knowledge of our

that infinite majeſtie, infinite power,
and infinite wiſedome of God, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Finally, it teacheth vs the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his moſt holy will, how far we
go aſtray from the right waye. VVhen
we looke vppon our ſelues onely, wee
appeare to be ſomewhat to our ſelues.
But when wee lift vp our eies to that

curiouſly to inquire of that vnreveiled

to be brought as an excuſe to our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

even from the beginning he
hath reached forth, as it were, his grace
in Ieſus Chriſt, to bee ſeene with the
eies, &amp; to be handled with the handes.
<hi>Waſh me]</hi> Againe, hee craveth remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſinnes, <hi>waſh mee</hi> (ſayeth hee) to
witte, with that ſelfe-ſame blood. <hi>That
I may waxe whiter then the ſnow]</hi> But hee
ſpeaketh this out by waye of compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
yea, and that indeede making the
compariſon, with the thing which in
the owne nature is moſt white. Alſo,
the compariſon is made from thinges
that are leſſe, to the end hee might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that there is nothing in nature ſo
white, pure and cleane, as is man, to
whome ſinnes are once forgiven, and
who is once waſhen by that blood of
Chriſt. Conſider here firſt, <hi>Dauid,</hi>
while hee craveth forgiueneſſe of ſins,
and peace of conſcience, hee ſeeketh
it vnder the ſymbolls and figures of
theſe waſhings of the lawe, whereby
ſometimes was ſhaddowed-out that
waſhing through the blood of Chriſt.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:10992:175"/>
We ſee therefore that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſoght the
forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes, in the onely
bloud of Ieſus Chriſt. There hes never
ben, nor never ſhalbe in time to come,
remiſſion of ſinnes, and conſequently
quietnes of the conſcience, except by
the bloud alone of Ieſus Chriſt, which
is certain, that the ancient Church &amp;
fathers, haue apprehended in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
and ſhaddowes. It may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that the Papiſtes, ſo long as they
feele not the weightines of their ſin, &amp;
of the wrath of God for ſinne (for the
conſcience of thoſe men, ſo far indeed
as my judgement can reach, is caſt vp
in a deep ſleep by that doctrine, which
daylie is taught among them) I ſaye
indeed, it may be, that for a time, being
thus afflicted, they vaunt in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
indulgences, Purgatory, and I
cannot tell what ſatisfactiones: By
all which, it is certaine, ſomewhat is
pulled awaie from the grace of Chriſt.
But if it come to paſſe, that they bee
oppreſſed in earneſte, with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:10992:175"/>
of ſinne, and with the ſenſe of
the wrath of GOD, they ſhall feele
ſurely, and publickly profeſſe, that all
thoſe things are vaine, and none other
things but dreames and triſles, which
now they ſo much commend: for then
they ſhal feele in experience, that there
is no remiſſion of ſinnes, or peace of
conſcience, without that bloud and
alone ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt. Which
would to God, at length thoſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men ſawe and learned, that both
Gods wrath is pacified, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of miſerable men quieted, by
that blood alone, which in themſelues
are not diſquieted &amp; troubled by any
other thinge, then by that ſenſe of the
wrath of God. O bleſſed is that peace &amp;
quietneſſe, which is by that bloud of
Chriſt only! Mark again in this place,
he promiſeth <hi>cleannes</hi> &amp; <hi>whitenes, whiter
then the very ſnow.</hi> If hee but once get
that, to be waſhen with the bloude of
chriſt. And indeed he doth this thing,
not to the end that he thinketh it ſhall
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:10992:176"/>
not come to paſſe, that ſinnes once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forgiven, in time to come, there
ſhall be no remnant left of ſinne and
vncleanneſſe in his nature. But to that
end, becauſe hee thinketh and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himſelfe, that all the guiltineſſe of
ſinne ſhal be taken away by the blood
of Chriſt, and by his perfite ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
once imputed, and that he ſhall be
in that eſtate, as if he had never ſinned
in his life. For wee haue a two-folde
purging and waſhing in Chriſte, the
one which is by blood, the other,
which is by the Spirite of Chriſt. That
waſhing which is by the blood of
Chriſt is moſt perfite and quieteth our
conſciences. But this waſhing which
is by the Spirite, it is begunne onely in
this life, and quieteth not the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
properly and of the owne ſelfe.
To ſpeake it in a worde, the forgiuenes
of ſinnes, which is by Chriſts blood,
is perfite and abſolute in all the partes
thereof. But the regeneration, which
is by the Spirite of Ieſus Chriſt, is but
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:10992:176"/>
begun onely in this life. <hi>Make mee to
heare]</hi> He doth yet continue in the ſelf
ſame petition: The meaning is, as if he
ſhould ſay, witneſſe vnto me through
thy holye Spirite inwardelie, that my
ſinnes are forgiuen me. And ſo it ſhall
come to paſſe, that thou ſhalt furniſh
vnto me ane exceeding great matter of
joy and gladneſſe. This is it, which in
other wordes hee ſpeaketh elſ-where.

<hi>Dauid</hi> in this place requireth that

the remiſſion of ſinnes, is an action in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely

worketh in our heartes, a wounder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

yea, without Chriſt, there is but a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

thereafter an evill conſcience. For if
after the ſenſe of ſinne there is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
made open to grace, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
there is a feeling of Gods anger,
there aryſeth in the mind intollerable
horrours. For of all enemies, the wrath

if the angry God ſhall at ſometime en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

they ſhall feele, how terrible a thing it
is to fall into the handes of the living
God. Therefore I ſay, that intollerable
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:10992:179"/>
horrours follow of the earneſt feeling
of ſinne not forgiuen, and that feare,
with which, as <hi>Moyſes</hi> threatneth, <hi>the

Theſe men are afrayde of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

to be ſure in no place. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe,
there followeth ane certaine
exceeding great joye of ſinne forgiven
and of a good conſcience, and a peace
which overco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth all vnderſtanding.
For ſin being once forgiven, wee feele
that there is a waye made open to vs
vnto the grace of God; neither yet can
it be ſaide, with how great a joye the
minde boyleth. And this is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing

This indeed were to be borne with,
that men do onely ſeeke the joyes and

to abide the ſight of the angry God
if we walked naked before Gods eies,
that is, not cled with Chriſt and his
righteouſneſſe. But as concerning the
wrath of God, in few words, this much
ſpeake we of it. The wrath of God, by
reaſon of his inviolable holines, and
alſo becauſe of the greatneſſe of ſinne,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:10992:180"/>
is ſo horrible, that in no caſe it can bee
borne of the creature. For ſeeing ſinne
is a certain violating as it were, of that
moſt holy majeſtie, is it any wounder
that the wrath which is a mainteiner
and revenger of ſuch a majeſtie nowe
violated, is ſo horrible? From whence

that man, wer not able
to ſuſteine that wrath. For like as if
God with his owne hande, would vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
any, and comfort him inwardly
by his Spirite, this man would not bee
oppreſſed with any kinde of violence;
<hi>We are afflicted on every ſide</hi> (ſayth <hi>Paul)

to beare it any longer, and he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that it might bee remooved from
him in theſe wordes, <hi>Hide away, thine

therefore, by the example of DAVID,
that even thoſe whome GOD deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
loveth, becauſe of their ſinnes at
ſome time, are not without ſome
grievous ſenſe of the wrath of God,
which indeede is done for this cauſe,
that they themſelues may come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

And maie knowe firſte, howe good
hee is who will not haue his owne

Then nexte, becauſe hee is holye and
juſt, in reſpect he beginneth his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at his owne houſe, yea, and will
not winke indeed at the ſinnes of his
owne. For that I may affirme boldlie,
that the godlie for the moſt parte are
chaſtiſed of GOD in this life: And
that GOD is exceeding long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
towarde the vngodlie. But the
Godlie on the otherſide, are touched
with a ſenſe of Gods loue in this life.
From thence ariſe that interchaunge

it is not poſſible for them to ſtand, yea,
but for one momente, vnles they bee

that the elect after they haue found in
experience, howe infirme and fragill
they are by nature without the Spirite

for a time, they more carefully, and
with more feruent deſires earneſtlie
craue his preſence and helpe. This is

the ſecond thing which hee offereth

neither is his minde enlightened by

the more he leaneth thereto, the more
is he blinded and hardned. For to ſuch

when he afflicteth his owne, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

the whole comfort of this world, and
would haue nothing eſteemed, that
his kingdome &amp; royall dignitie, if that
old and wonted ioye had not bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
vnto him, which aroſe from the
preſence of God, by his owne holie
Spirite. But if wee would not provoke
to wrath God preſent with vs, neither
yet would grieue his holy Spirit, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:10992:187"/>
wee ſhould haue that joy of the
Spirite, more ſolide and conſtant. For
from whence commeth that interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, becauſe we make defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from God. <hi>Dauid</hi> had God preſent
with him, hee had the Spirite the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter:
But after he had forſaken God,
by committing adultery and murther
together, he ſpoyled himſelfe, both of
that preſence of God, and likewiſe of
that ſolide comforte of his preſence.
Men commonly with all the ſtrength
they haue, provoke that holy Majeſty
of God to anger: But it commeth to
paſſe, I cannot tell howe, that in the
meane time, they appeare to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to liue at reſte, and with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
pleaſure, and delight themſelues
with a vaine dreame. For as the Lorde
ſaith, there is no peace for the wicked,
I ſpeak of the true peace, for I would
not call this ſtupidity a peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it commeth to paſſe, that neither
they feele their own ſinne, nor yet the
wrath of GOD, which thing they in
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:10992:188"/>
wofull experience ſhal learn ſome day
when ſuddainly being awakned out of
this dead drowſie ſleepe, they ſhall be
forced to beholde that angry face, &amp;
terrible countenance. <hi>And vphold me]</hi>
The ſelf-ſame, is the meaning of theſe
words, &amp; of the words preceeding: for
ſo at laſt wee feele God preſent, his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
gladnes, ariſing thereof, if we be
vp-holden by his Spirite. <hi>David</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
of the affections of his mind, leaſt
he be over-whelmed with them, as by
a certaine deluge. He craveth therfore,
that GOD would ſuſteine him by his
Spirit. For as, if a great boſſe be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the water, preſently the water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in into it, it is drowned: but if,
firſt it be blowen vp with wind, the aire
being incloſed, before it be caſt into
the water, it ſwimmeth in the ſuperfice
of the water: So our mind, if it remaine
voyde of the Spirit of God, it is drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
incontinent in the middeſt of the
waues of our affections: But if it bee
repleniſhed with the Spirite of God,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:10992:188"/>
it is not poſſible that it can bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed

                        </gap>, or of liberty. To the ende
we may vnderſtande the reaſon of the
word. it is to bee learned out of the 8.
chap. to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that there is a two
fold ſpirit, or rather, that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
effect, of that one &amp; ſelfe ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of GOD. The Apoſtle calleth the
former, <hi>the Spirite of bondage to feare,</hi>
that is, which at the preaching of the
law, toucheth vs with a ſenſe of our ſin
&amp; miſery: for vnles the Spirite of God
were effectuall in our hearts, with the
preaching of the law, ſurely by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the law alone, wee ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be touched with an earneſt ſenſe of
ſin, &amp; of our own miſery: this ſpirit ther
fore maketh vs to know our ſin &amp; miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and holdeth vs vnder feare of the
wrath of God, death, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation:
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:10992:189"/>
and therefore, it redacteth vs as it
were vtterly to a ſervile eſtate. For this
was of old proper vnto ſervantes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to feare puniſhment and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
at their maiſters hands. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
calleth that other ſpirit, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of adoption: It is he, who while the
Goſpel is preached, maketh vs to know
our deliverance from ſinne and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For we ſhould never be ſo touched
with the preaching of the Goſpel, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
in the meane time, the Spirite of
God were powerfull in vs, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vs to know our deliverance from
ſinne and miſery, and that we feele in
our heart, that fatherlie affection of
God toward vs, and conſequently lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
a teſtimonie within vs, that wee
are the ſonnes of God. And if wee be
ſonnes, that we are alſo delivered from
ſinne, wrath and damnaton. From
thence it is called, the Spirite of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or libertie, becauſe it witneſſeth
that in Chriſt wee are delivered from
ſinne and death. There is alſo another
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:10992:189"/>
cauſe, why it is called ſo, to witte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
renewing our minde according
to the image of GOD, it maketh vs in
the meane time freelie to ſerue God,
and that we walke in the liberty of the
Spirit. For by nature, there is no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,

is libertie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 17.</note> (ſayeth PAVLE.) And this is
that bleſſed Chriſtian libertie, wherby
we are ſo delivered, that we may ſerue
God, and not that wee ſhould liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our owne will, ſuch as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
as theſe Libertines &amp; Fpicures

But we muſt yet a little more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

abounded, grace ſuperabounded. The
waies of God by nature ar vnknowen
to man, and ſpecially that way of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
mercy in his owne Chriſt, of the
which natur, indeed was not able ever
at any time to ſuſpect. But after, beſide
nature, and againſt nature, it was revei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
notwithſtanding, the conſcience
trembling, through the feeling of ſin,
and of the wrath of God, ſo that a mid
cloud as it were, is caſt in betuixt the
ſight thereof, and the grace of God,
that it cannot but ſee very hardly. For
then ſuch an huge heape of ſinne ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
that it taketh away by force, the

blind at the light of that grace of God,
ſo that wee finde in experience, howe
hard a thing it is, eſpecially to a man
who is touched with an earneſt fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his ſinne, to haue before his
eies, that mercy of God in Chriſt: For
I ſpeake of him who is touched with a
ſenſe of his ſinne. For others, who
while they ſinne, yea, and ſinne grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
indeede, notwithſtanding, they
feele not that their ſinne, in ſpeech,
ſurely they promiſe to themſelues the
mercy of God in Chriſt, nevertheles,
in very deed they feele it not. For it is
eaſie to any ſecure man, and that ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
in his ſinne, in a dreame to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
all things to himſelfe. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
willing the weill of ſinners, in

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:10992:192"/>
moſte grievous ſinnes are pardoned,
ſuch as was this example of Gods
mercy in DAVID, the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in this reſpect, the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
that his ſinnes were, as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,

were the heavier, in that ſelfe-ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
that hee was a King, PAVLE the

had mercie vppon mee, that hee might

This way of bringing men vnto grace,
which is by experience, &amp; by his own
exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, God wil haue without al dout,
every one whoſoever haue felt at any

that taſt of grace, which they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues

                        <pb n="387" facs="tcp:10992:192"/>
promiſeth to do in this place. <hi>I wil teach
back-ſliders</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>thy waies]</hi> In this
place thou ſhalt marke, that the godly,
when God as it were, taking holde of
their hande, lift vp themſelues, they
ſtretch out their other hand, as it were
to lift vp others, whereby they alſo may
be participant of the ſame grace. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Chriſt calleth vpon them, they alſo at
the ſame time, cal others, that they may
come together vnto him, according
to that commandement of Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Peter, When thou art converted ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
thy brethren.</hi> For true faith, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is careful for the ſelf, but chiefly, this
is the ende of the purpoſe thereof,
through a certain zeale of the glory of
God, to promoove the ſalvation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to wit, that other ſinners may be
turned vnto God &amp; repent. For <hi>David</hi>
reſpecteth this ende, in teaching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that is, the mercie of GOD to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
ſinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they alſo might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:10992:193"/>
Of the which, that thinge appeareth,
that ſome taſte of the mercy of GOD,
preceedeth turning vnto God, &amp; that
faith is the cauſe of Repentance. For
it cannot bee, that men can be turned
vnto God, vnles they be allured with

                        </gap>eeling of his fatherlie loue. <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me from blood]</hi> Now the third time
he repeateth that petition, of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe
of ſinnes, for the conſcience
of his haynous facte continually pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the man, and this infidelitie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
laboureth to extinguiſh faith and
the Spirite, whereby the ſinner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth
him ſelfe of the remiſſion of
his ſinnes, therefore by crying, and by
crying again, he wraſtleth with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie
of nature. There is none of all,
which is to ſeeke forgiueneſſe of our
ſins at God, without ſome wraſtling:
I ſpeake of that man, which is to ſeeke
by faith, and by a ſerious feeling. For
it is eaſie to the ſecure man, and that
thinketh nothing of ſinne and miſery,
to craue for the faſhion, the remiſſion
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:10992:193"/>
of his ſinnes, yea, and that not over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
but onely once, <hi>O God,</hi> (ſayeth
he, very rawly and coldly) <hi>be mercifull
vnto me. David</hi> therefore now the
third time, craveth pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes
of his ſinne; and he poynteth
out his ſinne in particular. For when
the conſcience of ſinne vrgeth men,
they are not aſhamed to profeſſe and
name it in particular, yea, &amp; that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licklie.
Alſo, the cauſe wherefore men
are aſhamed, by name to poynt out
their ſinnes, and to confeſſe them, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſeth
of this, that there is not an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
feeling and conſcience of ſinne.
But let vs ſee, which was <hi>Davids</hi> ſin in
particular. <hi>Deliver me, ô God</hi> (ſayth he)
<hi>from bloud]</hi> For it appeareth, that the
conſcience of man-ſlaughter, mooved
the man chiefely. For this tormented
him, that hee had ſhamefully ſlayne
that man, whoſe wife hee had defyled
in adultery, and that he had heaped ſin
vpon ſinne: Therefore he craveth that
he might bee delivered from bloud,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:10992:194"/>
no otherwiſe then if he had bin who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
defiled with the bloud of any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
man, which ſo faſtly had cleaved
vnto him, that, vnleſſe it were wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with Gods owne hand, it could
not be at all poſſible to be wiped away
and clenſed. For man-ſlaughter, being
once committed, and the ſlaughter or
the murther of an innocent man exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
the whole blood is powred out
and runneth backe as it were, vpon the
man-ſlayer, and dyeth him no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
then the purple dye doth the
Wooll. <hi>If your ſinnes</hi> (ſayeth the Lord)
<hi>were as skarlet,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eſay. 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out vpon you (for he had ſaid before,
<hi>that their hands were bloudy)</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<hi>I will make you as white as ſnow.</hi>
Alſo, being this way dyed and ſpotted
with the bloud of the innocent man:
The man-ſlayer continually appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in the ſight of God. And God out
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:10992:194"/>
of his judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſent, looketh vpon him
with an horrible countenance, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
hee ſpoyled his owne Image, and
likewiſe the common natur of al men.
The man-ſlayer, in whatſoever part of
the worlde he be in, is notable to flie
from this face of God. But this is the
ſtupiditie of our murtherers, that no
way they feele this. <hi>David</hi> alſo for a
time, ſleeped in his ſinne, neither yet
ſaw he that he was defiled wholy with
the blood of the innocent man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet did he ſee that angry face of
God, but being at length awakened vp
at the threatning of the Prophet, bee
was no longer able to ſuffer himſelfe
ſo to bee defiled with that blood, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet was hee able to abide, being
thus defiled with blood, to be caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
&amp; layd open to the ſight of that
angry eie: but very oft he cryed, &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
ſought; that God would pardon
him his ſin, that he wold waſh him, that
hee would deliver him from bloud:
which wold to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:10992:195"/>
who are not touched, either with a
conſcience of their ſinne, or of the
wrath of God, neither yet make any
end of murthers and oppreſſions, they
would ſee at laſt, their owne bloodie
hands, they would ſee alſo that God
ſaw them, which ſurely he ſeeth, &amp; ſhal
at length ſee ſom day, when he ſhal tak
a vengeance vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, except in time
they repente. <hi>David</hi> appeareth to crye
out, through ſome feling of the wrath
of GOD, that he might bee delivered
from bloud. For the ſenſe of innocent
blood, and the feeling of wrath, are
continually ioyned together. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
he crieth vnto God, the
God of his ſalvation. Of the which, ſo
familiar an incalling: in this appeareth
ſufficiently, that <hi>Dauid</hi> felt therewith
the mercy of his God. For the faithful
together, and at one time, vſe to bee
touched, both with ſome ſenſe of the
wrath, and with a ſenſe of the mercie
of God: by which thing indeede, the
faithfull differ from the Infidels: For
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:10992:195"/>
the faithful feele both, that is, both the
wrath and the mercy of their God in
ſome certain meaſure, and at the ſame
time in which they are afrayd of wrath
&amp; of the angry God, at the ſame time,
they cleaue faſte vnto him; neither yet
doe they ſuffer themſelues to be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
away from his worde and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
Vpon the which they depende, as
it were vppon a certaine rocke, in the
exceeding great toſſing too and fro of
the waues. But the infidels, and ſuch as
the Lord hath caſten off, at what time
they feele his wrath, in the meane
time there is no ſenſe of grace; &amp; while
they ſee the helles opened: Wherwith
they are even nowe preſently to bee
ſwallowed vp, they haue nothing in
the meane time, to which they may
cleaue, or which, as it were, ſtretching
out the hande, they may take hold on,
neither God, nor yet the promiſes of
God in Chriſt, from which aryſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
horrours, with which no
comfort is conjoyned. Then indeede
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:10992:196"/>
they are compelled to eſteeme thoſe to
bee bleſſed, who haue learned in this
life, to draw neere vnto God by faith,
and to take a grip of Chriſt, and of the
promiſes made in him. <hi>Let my tongue

That is, thy mercy, which

Marke what hee doeth, being nowe
delivered from ſinne and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
DAVID being condemned, could
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:10992:196"/>
not prayſe God, <hi>Who</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>ſhall
prayſe thee in hell?</hi> Alſo, <hi>Dauid</hi> knewe
very wel that God was of that nature
and diſpoſition, that he would haue al
his workes to redounde to his glory
againe, and the fruites of his benefites
to returne vnto himſelfe; and from
thence it is, that hee communicateth
not his benefites indifferently, and
without diſcretion, to every ſorte of
men whatſoever: I ſpeak chiefely of
ſpiritual bleſſings. For he giveth thoſe
temporal and bodely things, yea, even
to the reprobat. But he giveth Chriſte
and his benefites, to none but to the
faithfull; for in theſe onely hee attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to the ende of his benefites, and
thoſe alone who receiue them in faith,
glorifie that God the giver. What, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou, that ther commeth any thing
to the increaſe of the glory of God, by
the praiſes that cum from vs? I anſwer,
God indeed in himſelf is moſt perfit,
and all ſufficiente, and that his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
conſiſteth perfite within himſelfe,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:10992:197"/>
without the helpe of any of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
without the which, The Father
glorifyeth the Sonne; The Sonne the
Father; The Father and the Sonne the
holy Spirite; The holy Spirite the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Sonne. But for this cauſe,
God craveth his glory from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in reſpect hee is righteous. Nowe
his righteouſneſſe requireth, that the
creature, acknowledge the owne Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
and glorifie him, the fountaine
of al good things in his benefits. Alſo,
that good thing, which is in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of GOD, belongeth to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whoſe happineſſe conſiſteth in
this, that by all duties, it ſerue God the
owne Creator &amp; redemer. Yea, &amp; this
ſame thing, every one of the godlie
finde in experience in themſelues. For
if at any time they feele not their hart
to be louſed into the praiſes of GOD,
then ſurely there is no comfort, there
is no gladneſſe. But contrariwiſe, if at
any time they feele their heart to bee
touched to prayſe their own Creator,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:10992:197"/>
to ſeeke all whatſoever they haue need
of at him, to giue him prayſe for
benefites received, then ſurely they
appeare to them to be bleſſed. <hi>For thou

Wherefore it might bee asked concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

their own deſervings and works,
they might put their confidence in
Chriſtes ſacrifice alone, where of all
thoſe Leviticall ſacrifices were types:
And that their faith in time comming,
might bee ſtrengthened by that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

of Religion, in hearing of the word, in

by God, but if there be not therewith

he abhorreth them. Concerning ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
I mark this onely in this place,
that thoſe which ſpecially were called
propitiatorie, were ſo many types and
figures of that onely one ſacrifice of
Chriſt, vppon whom were to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
the ſinnes of the world, and the
curſe of God. Of the which it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
how great the excellencie of this
ſacrifice is, vnto which, ſo many ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
offered, ſince the beginning of
the worlde, did ſerue, as ſo many ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
thereof. There was never at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

there are ſo many prophecies, ſo many

this plainly prooveth, that this ſacrifice
was paſſing excellent, &amp; moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which wee ſhould not at any time

alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was of neceſſitie requiſite to be

for they conſidered another thing

to be ſeene, ſo he would open our eies
that we may at length clearely ſee the
ſame. Let vs conſider the worſhip now
which pleaſeth God, and let vs weigh
the wordes of this text. <hi>The ſacrifices
of God</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>are ane broken Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite]</hi>
Hee calleth them ſacrifices in
the plurall number, becauſe that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
one ſacrifice of a contrite ſoule is
inſteede of manie, yea, and of all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

that is, acceptable to GOD. I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
by <hi>the broken Spirite,</hi> as it were,
bruſed into little peeces, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecte
through the conſcience of the

Then turning vnto GOD, hee ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>O God, thou deſpiſeſt not a broken

leſſe, but meaning more, whereby
hee ſignifieth, that the broken and
the contrite ſoule is moſte accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

ſome-what more diligentlie, what hee
calleth a broken hearte. After that
anie man is awakned vppe, out of his

hee may ſee his owne filthineſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

nature of GOD, which is ſette downe
to vs to bee righteous and holie in

that they ar blinde: yea, they think that
they ſee very clearely, when in the

blinder then any Mowle: while at

vnto them. After then, I ſay, any hath
looked vppon the filthineſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe

nothing to himſelfe; and this is

which cauſeth repentance, that is, the
changing of the minde, the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the old man, and the quickning
of the new man. This ſorrow which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſeth
from God offended, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
therewith an vnſpeakable ioy,
proceeding from the ſenſe of Gods
loue. For it is not poſſible, that that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
feling of that fatherly loue, ſhould
lacke all ſenſe of gladneſſe. For, which
thing may appeare wounderfull to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the more the feeling of the loue of
God in Chriſt be, ſo much more is the
ſorrowe, yea, the gladneſſe is ſo much
the more. For no man reioyceth in
earneſt, who hath not bene in earneſt
ſorrowfull. And this the eſtate of a
repenting ſinner; this is the moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull,
yea, and alſo the moſt ioyfull
eſtate of mortal men. Now then God
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:10992:202"/>
having looked vpon the heart of man
thus broken and contrite, he wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
delighteth therein, and therein
quietly ſatisfieth himſelf. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence
God himſelfe denyeth,<note place="margin">Pſay. 66.</note> that hee dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in Temples made with hands, yea,
he denyeth alſo, that hee dwelleth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in heaven or earth, but hee profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
that his dwelling place and houſe
of reſt, is a poore &amp; a contrite hart. But
if thou ſay, ſeeing our minde is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regenerated in this life, no not the
hart of any man, who moſt ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth:
how commeth it to paſſe, that
God taketh ſo much pleaſure therin, ſo
that alſo he dwelleth &amp; quieteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
therein? I anſwere: He who hath
a contrite heart; this man therewith is
indued with faith: For contrition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
of faith, and of the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the mercy and loue of GOD in
Chriſt. And the heart, although it bee
not altogether regenerated, by faith
pleaſeth God, to witte, by faith in that
alone ſacrifice, wherby both the wrath
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:10992:202"/>
of God againſt ſin is pacified, and the
conſcience of the ſinner is quieted:
Therefore God taketh pleaſure in the
contrite hart, becauſe the ſame is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
alſo, and hath Chriſt dwelling ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by faith. To the ende therefore that
we may pleaſe God, wee ſhould never

O God, repaire &amp; a mend that breach
which I haue made in thine houſe,

to do it. It was an eaſie thing for mee,
ſurely to deſtroy this people by my

the ruine againe, and to make it of new
whole. Of the which you ſee, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:10992:203"/>
when he craveth of GOD that
he would doe well to his people, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
therewith, that in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
the people were deſtroyed. The
conſcience therfore of that evil where
by hee hurte the people, vrgeth him
now to pray to God for them. If Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
fayle in any thing, commonly it is
in their office, to wit, that they governe
not the common-wealth aright. Such
was the fault of <hi>David,</hi> when he layde
out the people of God to the ſword of
the enemie: and therefore of neceſſity
it is, that their fault redoundeth to the
whole people, And from thence it
commeth to paſſe, that the ſinne of the
Prince is more grievous, then any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
mans fault, in reſpect it ſpreadeth
further abroad, and by the daunger
thereof involveth moe. And from
thence it proceedeth, that when God
deliberateth, either to chaſtife or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
any people, he giveth to that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
fooliſh Princes and counſellours,
that ſtirre vp alway pernicious or not
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:10992:204"/>
neceſſary warres. But contrariwiſe,
when he will prefer any people, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to them good Princes and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours.
When God would haue the
Iewes to bee exerciſed and afflicted
with the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> hee gaue wicked
Princes to the people, <hi>Saul, Ioram, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaz.</hi>
When againe he would haue the
Iewes to be in a proſperous eſtate and
flouriſh, hee gaue them good Princes;
<hi>David, Ezechias, Ioſias.</hi> The common
ſorte of men, while they looke vpon
theſe thinges, and marke this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge,
they impute all, either to the
cowardice and fooliſhneſſe, or to the
courage and wiſedome of the Princes
themſelues: Or finally, to Fortune &amp;
chance: But they cry miſerably, for all
thoſe things proceed from GOD, by
reaſon of the thankfulneſſe, or ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the people: Wherefore, while
we ſee theſe things to be done by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
let vs lift vp our eies, not ſo much
to the Princes, as to God &amp; our ſelues.
Again ſee, <hi>David</hi> in this place, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:10992:204"/>
his owne ſinne, he had hurt the whole
people, being touched with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of the mater, he earneſtly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to god, for the repairing of his skaith
wherby he da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nified the people of god.
Moreover obſerue, <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reconciled to God, preſently he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceedeth
for the people: he who him
ſelf is firſt reconciled to God, &amp; nowe
is quiet in his owne conſcience, hee is
bolde alſo to interceed for others at
Gods hands. But he who is not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to God, and is therefore yet
guiltlie in conſcience, he dare not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
be ſo bolde as to plead his owne
cauſe before God. How much therfore
is it profitable for a people, to haue ſum
certain good man, &amp; familiar with god
that hath his conſcience well pacified,
and that by faith in Ieſus Chriſt. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one ſuch like man, by his prayers, is
able to be profitable to many others
before God. God grant that the Lorde
may giue to everie one of vs this faith
in Chriſt Ieſus, which is the ground of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:10992:205"/>
all theſe things, with the which we can
neither do, or be bold to do any thing.
Laſt of al, in the laſt verſe, he mooveth
God to do well to his people from his
owne thankfulneſſe, which hee, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the people, wil be bounde to
performe to God, to wit, in offring the
lawfull ſacrifices &amp; acceptable to God,
according as it was the cuſtome of
thoſe times, when men were vnder the
rudiments of the worlde, &amp; diſcipline
of the Law: The words are, <hi>Then ſhalt
thou take pleaſure in the ſacrifices of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe]</hi>
That is, lawfull ſacrifices ſhal
be offered vnto thee, according to the
preſcript of thy law, &amp; therefore they
ſhalbe ſacrifices of righteouſneſſe. For
it is not permitted vnto vs to worſhip
God according to our pleaſure; but it
is neceſſary, that wee ſerue him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own ordinance. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
therefore is, as if he ſhould ſaye:
The ſacrifices appoynted by thy ſelfe,
ſhalbe offred vnto thee, and thou ſhalt
take pleaſure in them. Thou ſhalt alſo
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:10992:205"/>
delight in burnte offerings, yea, which
ſhalbe altogether conſumed to aſhes:
They ſhall alſo offer, according to the
cuſtome, Bullockes vppon thine altar.
God ſeeketh his owne glorie, yea, and
<hi>David</hi> alſo acknowledgeth the ſame in
deed; nevertheleſſe, except he himſelf
furniſh matter to his glory, that is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
hee provoke men to glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlfe
by his benefites, they will not
glorifie him: For none there is in hell,
that can worſhip God. Againe, al men
indeed are not thankfull to the Lorde
for the benefites beſtowed vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but theſe onely, who haue taſted howe
gracious the Lord is, that is, who haue
ſome feeling of his favour in Chriſt
Ieſus. Of the mercy of God, there are
many evidents indeed; for looke how
many his benefites are, ſo many docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are there: But ſundry of them
are of a common and vulgare mercie
only, ſuch as is, to wit, of the Creator,
toward his creature: But Chriſt alone
is a ſure evident to vs, of ſingular mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:10992:206"/>
and loue; ſuch as is the favour of the
father towarde the Son. For God will
not haue that mercy and that loue
of his, whereby hee hath loved the
VVorlde, to bee made manifeſt by
any other thing, then by his Sonne
given for the world. VVherefore, only
thoſe, who are in Chriſt, and embrace
him by faith, thoſe alone I ſaye, feele
how ſweete the Lorde is, becauſe into
their hearts onely, that loue of God is
powred out. Wherefore alſo, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
are theſe, who can be thankful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God for his benefites received. We
conclude therefore that, which hath
now oft bene beaten in our eares, that
we muſt chiefely endevour to beleeue
in Ieſus Chriſt; without whome, no
good thing can we get; without who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
we doe no parte of our duety, either to
God or men; without whom finally,
there is no ſalvation. Therefore God
is to be prayed vnto continually, that
as of his infinite mercy, he hath given
vnto vs his only begotten ſonne: ſo he
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:10992:206"/>
would open the eies of our minde, to
the end that we might ſee himſelf: Alſo
that he would open our hearts, that we
might entirely feele him, without
whom there is no feeling of gladnes in
the hearts of ſinners: And this is to be
prayed for by vs, for and by the ſame
Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne of God, &amp; our
Lord: To whom with the father and
the holy Spirite, be al honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for ever and ever: Amen.</p>

his enemies: Thirdly, hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to that former glorying. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the glorying in his aſſurance.
<hi>David</hi> after hee had bene afflicted and
troubled in minde, at length he quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:10992:207"/>
himſelfe in God. Having then felt
ſo great a joy of that reſt, hee gloryeth
thereof in this ſpeech. <hi>My ſeule onely i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at reſt in God]</hi> The Hebrew worde it
ſelfe ſignifieth to bee ſilent, which our
interpreter turneth to be at reſt: Then
<hi>Davids</hi> ſoule made a noyſe within
him, as he ſayeth in another place. <hi>Why
art thou caſt downe my ſoule, why makeſt
thou a noyſe within me?</hi> But it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
doth now his ſoule keepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
when notwithſtanding wee ſee,
that hee vttereth out theſe ſpeeches? I
anſwere, that then any mans ſoule kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
ſilence, when it maketh not a
noyſe, and is not troubled, although in
the meane time it glory never ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Then there are three arguments,
wherfore his ſoule taketh reſt in God.
The firſt is, becauſe God is the author
of his ſalvation: Then drawing neere
to God himſelfe, and not content with
this his benefite alone, except hee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
God him ſelf, and ſit vpon him as
it were a rocke or mountaine: <hi>He is
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:10992:208"/>
only my rocke,</hi> (ſayth he) &amp;c.] The third
argument, is the effect of the ſecond. <hi>I
ſhall not be mooued out of my place</hi> (ſaieth
he) <hi>by any great motion indeed]</hi> whereby
it ſhal come to paſſe, that I ſhal altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fall. Mark firſt, <hi>David</hi> ſurely wold
haue patiently ſuffred affliction,<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.</note> (as he
ſpeaketh of himſelfe in another place)
to witte, becauſe <hi>hee had decreed to take
heede to al his waies, leaſt he ſhould ſin with
his tongue.</hi> But the affliction burſteth
out, and his ſoule maketh a ſturre, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
at laſt he quieteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in God. Every one of the godlie,
would indeede humble them ſelues
with ſilence vnder Gods hande, but
troubles waxing greater &amp; greater, the
affection cannot conteine the ſelfe,
which after that it is louſed, it reſteth
not, and taketh breath to the ſelf firſte,
before it feele GOD preſent with it. I
will ſpeake this once, there is no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide
quietneſſe indeede to our ſoule,
except to GOD alone. It is not in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
not in honoures, it is not in the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:10992:208"/>
arme of man. Finally, it is not in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolles
and fayned Gods, of whome
DAVID ſpeaketh. <hi>They multiply</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
hee) <hi>their ſorrowes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>that giue in dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

thing I praye you, doe Idols fill
mens mindes, but with fearefull ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition?
The ſame DAVID
in the fourth Pſalme, manifeſtlie
declareth, that his ſoule taketh not
reſt in riches, <hi>Lift vp</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>the
light of thy countenance vppon vs, ô Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,
and thou ſhalt put more gladneſſe in
our ſoules, then at that time, vvhen the
cornes and vvines are increaſed.</hi> In which
place, you ſee, that hee preferreth his
ſecuritie and gladneſſe in God, to that
whole gladneſſe of thoſe men, which
take their reſt in ſuch like things. <hi>My
ſoule therefore doth reſt in God only]</hi> and
therefore, becauſe the wicked cannot
reſte in GOD, there is no peace to
them. (ſayeth the Lorde) Obſerue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that DAVID meaneth not here
anie commoun ſecuritie of minde.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:10992:209"/>
but a ſingular and notable; whereby it
commeth to paſſe, that one may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that ſuch a notable quietneſſe of
mind, went before ſome certaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
perturbation. For ſurely, looke
howe much the more the reſte of the
minde is, ſo much the more was the
commotion of the mind before. Mark
in the third roome, <hi>David</hi> ſeeketh not
out the cauſes of his ſecuritie in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
but without himſelfe in God, in
whom, to wit, his ſoule doth quiet the
ſelfe, while he calleth him <hi>his rocke and
his rower.</hi> Nothing therefore which is
in our ſelues, can properly be the cauſe
of the tranquillity of our mind; no, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
thou ſhouldeſt ſpeake indeede of
faith it ſelfe, or of hope; if by the name
of faith thou vnderſtand onely the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of the apprehending of chriſt.
For whatſoever thinges in vs, yea,
even the regenerate, they are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
all faith, hope, loue, and workes
flowing from theſe, as from their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
In God alone therefore is the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:10992:209"/>
cauſe of our peace and quietnes in the
ſtrength of God alone, in the loue of
GOD alone through Chriſt. <hi>Paule,</hi>
when hee publiſhed the ſecurity of
mind; he ſayeth not indeed, who ſhall
ſeparate vs from that loue, whereby
we loue God? But in that place hee
ſayeth, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate vs from that
loue of Chriſt,</hi> that is, from the loue
whereby God loveth vs in Chriſt? let
the papiſtes take heed to this, who ſeek
eaſe to themſelues, and their ſoules, in
their owne workes, whereby it is, that
I cannot be perſwaded to beleeue, that
thoſe men can enjoy loue, peace, and
quietneſſe of mind, with a conceit of
their owne workes. Note fourthly,
that he ſayeth, <hi>hee ſhal not bee remooved
out of his place</hi> with any, at the leaſt, a
great commotion. He denyeth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
a commoving, but hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
that it ſhall not bee any great or
notable commoving. For in this life
we muſt not hope that we ſhal be free
alwaies from all commotions. For <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                        <pb n="358" facs="tcp:10992:210"/>
reaſoneth not ſo, becauſe no waies
ſhall I bee commoved, therefore my
ſoule reſteth in God: For if thou haſte
not decreed with thy ſelfe, to quiet
thy ſelfe in GOD, vnleſſe it be vnder
that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, that thou ſhalt nowaies
be commoved all thy life long; truely
it will never come to paſſe, that thou
ſhalt reſt thy ſelfe in him, either in this
life, or in that other life. Let it be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to thee, if thou be not oppreſſed
with afflictions: For the godly haue a

the latter, openeth vp and declareth,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:10992:210"/>
that which is the former. For the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, as if he ſhould ſay, as a bulgeing
wall and full of riftes, falleth downe
through the owne weight thereof, or
is throwen downe by no great travell,
ſo ye ſhal be conſumed, by your owne
envie and wickednes. <hi>They onely deuiſe]</hi>
He poynteth out clearely that their de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſing.
They enter in counſell to thruſt
me downe from my dignitie. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this dignitie, looke 1. Sam, 18. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
being appoynted captaine of <hi>Sauls</hi>
gard, he ſo bare himſelfe, that his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
was approuen of all men,
yea, and was preferred by the damſels
that ſang, to the governement of <hi>Saull</hi>
himſelfe. <hi>Saull hath ſlaine his thouſand,
but</hi> DAVID <hi>hath ſlaine his ten thouſand.</hi>
Then he ſhewed vnder what pretence
they did this thing: They haue preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a lie to their counſells, (ſayth he)
which againe hee declareth by theſe
wordes, <hi>With their month they bleſſe,
but within them ſalues they curſe.</hi> As
if he he ſhould ſay, they profes indeed
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:10992:211"/>
friendſhip, but in verie truth they are
enemies. Marke firſt, the things which
mooued <hi>David</hi> before, now the ſame
thinges moue him nothing, while his
ſoule quieteth the ſelfe in God, hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemeth
nothing of all his enemies.
For that ioy which ariſeth in the mean
time that any reſteth himſelfe in God,
it deuoured vp all feare and ſorrowe
altogether, yea, it maketh confidence
to ariſe, whereby wee glory againſt all
contrarie afflictions. But contrariwiſe,
when the ſoule quieteth not the ſelfe
in God, it is moved, yea with the moſt
trifling thinges, it is affrayde with the
name of perſecution. For the cauſe
wherefore this firſt ſeemeth to be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to many, is this, becauſe they ſee
not that life and glorie which is with
Chriſt hidd vp in God. Obſerue nixt,
let the wicked alone to themſelues a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſpace, &amp; you ſhal ſee them fal down
with their owne weight, none other
waies then a wall full of riftes, or a wal
bowing for-ward, which falleth of the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:10992:211"/>
owne weight, Neuertheles, few there
are that ſee this thing, and from this it
ariſeth, that the outwarde happines of
the wicked moueth manye ſo much.
Theſe onely ſee that thing, whoſe ſoul
quieteth the ſelfe in God, and theſe
who look a farre off vpon thoſe men
as it were out of a watch tower. Alſo,
the regenerate themſelues, at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
they ſee not this thing, as <hi>David,</hi>
or whoſoeuer hee was that wrote that
73, Pſalme, he ſaw it not, while he had
entred into the ſanctuarie, and then in
deede he perceiued their ende, he ſaw
that they ſtoode in verie ſlipperie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
hee ſawe that in an momente they
went to deſtruction. Obſerue thirdlie.
The enemies laboured to caſt downe
<hi>Dauid</hi> who was exalted from his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
He whome God lifteth vppe, the
wicked indevoure to caſte that man
down out of his place, yea even at that
time, when they ſee God himſelfe to
trauell to the direct contrary ſide. <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>

                        <hi>David</hi> appoynted for the kingdome,

all the godlie to doe, looke
the fourth Pſalme. <hi>Sonnes of men,</hi> (ſayth
he) <hi>how long ſhall my glorie bee an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

therefore be affrayde of the prayers of

aggrement. <hi>[O my ſoule]</hi> He returneth
to that firſt glorying, concerning his
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in God, &amp; hauing altered a lit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle
the manner of ſpeach, hee ſpeaketh
to his own ſoule: Alſo he bringeth out
the ſame reaſon which he did before.
The ſecond, drawing neerer to God as
before, he is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent of Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
except hee poſſeſſe God himſelfe
and ſit vpon him; as vpon a rocke. The
third is the ſame which was before. In
the eight verſe he repeateth the ſecond
reaſon, the manner of ſpeach being
ſomewhat changed. Of al which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
indeede marke this, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſatisfieth not himſelfe in multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:10992:212"/>
of wordes, whereby he amplifieth
God and his benefites: Alſo he alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the forme of ſpeach, hee calleth
him his ſalvation, his rocke, ſtrong
holde, his glorie. He ſayeth that his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
was receaued of him, &amp; he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth
that he himſelf is ſaluation and
a rock: finally he pronunceth that his

Of theſe thinges you ſee firſt, that that
ſoule which quieteth the ſelf in God,
returneth nowe and then to glorying
in God. Then conſider and learne out
of this repetition, that the ſoule is not
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:10992:213"/>
ſo quieted and ſetled in this life, but
truely in the meane time it is troubled
in ſome meaſure. The ſea while it is
not toſſed too &amp; fro with ſtormes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with-ſtan-ding
it is commoued with
ſome ſoft aire. The affection if it bee
not preſentlie inflamed, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it is puffed vppe in ſome certaine
meaſure. Wherefore our ſoules hath
neede now and then of a newe exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to this reſt in God. Conſidder
thirdlie. The firſt argument of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, from waiting on or from hope,

ſhoulde not put their confidence in
men, for although this be not expreſly

is from the vanitie of men,

their greater vanitie, hee calleth them
lies and vanitie it ſelfe. Alſo he ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the vanitie of men, making a
compariſon of them with vanitie it
ſelfe. Vnderſtand not this place to bee
exceſſiue or hyperbolick, for it is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
it ſelfe as he ſpeaketh. I grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that man before the fel was ſome
what, but after the fal, he is redacted to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:10992:214"/>
nothing. For there remained not in
him, yea not ſo much as one remanent
crome of vprightneſſe and holines.
And if there bee any thing in him, it is
wholy euill, and if man be any thinge,
he is whollie evill, howe much ſo euer
it be, or very wickedneſſe it ſelfe. And
to bee this waye ſomewhat, it is worſe
then to bee nothing at all. Let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
take heede to this, that make ſo
much of the nature of man, yea to wit,
ſo exellent make they it. <hi>Dauid</hi> recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it amongſt the moſt vaineſt things
but they will haue it to bee ſomewhat
alſo in themſelues, and they take away
ſomething from gods grace, that ſome
vprightneſſe may be giuen to man. Of
theſe thinges marke firſt, a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
betwixt them that put their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in God, and them who truſt to
other thinges. They who put their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
in God, they verye willinglie
communicat this benefit with others,
and will haue all men with them to
put their truſt in God. But thoſe who
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:10992:215"/>
put their confidence in other thinges,
as in riches, in honoures, in the arme of
man, they do not willinglie admit any
others whoſoeuer into their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and participation of theſe things.
For they woulde together and at one
time devoure them vppe themſelues.
God is a good thinge, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for all men, neither yet if many at

man ſhall be in a worſe caſe who is par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticipant

for this cauſe we truſt to euerie thinge
that by them wee may firmelie ſtande,
and neither fall downe nor vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Theſe verelie ſtand firmely alone
who put their confidence in GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
But they who put their truſte in
any other things whatſoeuer, they are
ſo farre away from that, that by them
they are able to ſtande, that contrarie

other wayes then water powred on

to all men whatſoeuer. <hi>[God hath
once ſpoken]</hi> This is a common argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to both the partes of the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
and it is taken from Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
himſelfe. The ſtronge, mightie
and mercifull God, will recompence
all men according to their workes, let
euerie man therefore take heede, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee truſteth in GOD or in other
thinges. The anteſident is prouen by
the teſtimonie of Gods owne worde,
yea and that twiſe repeated ouer. <hi>God
hath ſpoken to me</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> As if
he ſhould ſay. The ſame God hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
oft confirmed it vnto me. Obſerue
firſt, <hi>David</hi> envieth not this excellent
good thinge in them, which is GOD
him ſelfe, notwithſtanding they envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yea this verie tranſitorie life of his.
For to this purpoſe belongeth this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition:
By <hi>Davids</hi> example there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou haſt ſet downe the nature of
the Church, together with the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the enemies thereof. Theſe doe
envie the verie tranſitorie life of the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:10992:217"/>
members of the Church, but the
Church envieth not them, yea ſhe
wiſheth vnto them earneſtlie life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.
Chriſt prayed for them that
curſed him, <hi>Steuen</hi> prayed that the ſins
of thoſe that ſtoned him ſhould not be
laide to their charge. Marke heare, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie,
how great the madnes of man
is, for it is a verie greate ſinne to put
confidence in thinges, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
are indifferent, as in riches, in
honours, or in the arme of man, which
thinges you may vſe well alſo. How
great then is the madneſſe, and howe
grieuous is their ſinne, which put their
hope in reafe and oppreſſion, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges that are of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
evill, which things you can at no
time vſe well. Notwithſtanding ſome
cauſe of this ſo great a madneſſe may
bee learned, yea by this Example of
SAVLES courtiers, to witte, that they
committed all theſe thinges without
any puniſhment. Now men preſentlie
thinke that this is permitted to them
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:10992:217"/>
to doe, which is permitted to be done
without any inflicting of puniſhment.
This confidence therefore in wicked
thinges, is not ſo much to be imputed
to the wicked doers themſelues, as it is
to bee laide to their charge, whome it
became to haue puniſhed them, as to
<hi>Saull</hi> and to the other magiſtrates, who
vſe to winke at the wicked deedes of
courtiers, and of their flatterers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
perverſlie and prepoſterouſlie
magiſtrates and earthlie judges giue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to wicked men &amp; malefactours.
We learne in this place, that that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye
judge ſhall make it to come to
paſſe, that the wicked at length ſhall
vaniſh away in their reafe and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Finally, this is not to bee preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that <hi>David</hi> ſayeth, that hee was
once and againe admoniſhed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that righteous judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God.
whereby hee will recompence euerie
man according to his worke: Which
thing indeed is an euident, that <hi>David</hi>
thought now and then of that laſt and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:10992:218"/>
terrible judgement: Of the which ſure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie
it becommeth vs all, yea the beſte
men whoſoeuer oft to meditate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For this is the nature, yea of the
beſte men, that looking vpon that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the Lorde, they haue neede to
be brought vnder correction. For <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeaketh thus of himſelf <hi>knowing,</hi> ſayth

of his miſerie and ſinne, then through

out of the fourth verſe; thirdly by
a faith quieting the ſelfe in GOD, hee

that it ſhall certainely come to

In the thirde verſe, hee promiſeth that

indeede O God, oughte to giue their

the benefites ſpirituall towarde the
Church. Of the ſpirituall the firſte is
the forgiuenes of ſinnes, by which he
concludeth that propoſed praiſe, to
witt, that confidence is due vnto God,
&amp;c. Of this argumente that appeareth
to bee true, which wee haue ſpoken,
that DAVID burſteth foorth into this
praiſe, from a ſenſe of Gods mercie,
and of the remiſſion of his ſinnes. The
wordes themſelues, whereby this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
is expreſſed, clearelie do ſignifie
that DAVID had firſt wraſtled with his
ſinne, then that ſinne preuailed ouer
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:10992:220"/>
him in this combat. Thirdly, that God
had purged this ſinne, from thence he
giueth the glory of the forgiueneſſe of
his ſins, or of his deliuerance from ſin,
to God alone. <hi>Thou</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>clengeſt]</hi>
for it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be, that any man can aſcrive
to God the praiſe of the remiſſion of
his ſinnes, vnleſſe hee haue firſt fough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with ſinne, and haue felt himſelfe
weaker then ſin in that combat: Then
that God is ſtronger then ſinne, to the
which he himſelfe was inferiour, from
whence I praye you proceedeth that
voice of PAVLE, <hi>I thank God by Chriſt?</hi>
We reade in the ſame chapter, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
had foughten with ſin: Then, that
hee was carried captiue awaye vnder
the lawe of ſinne: of which ariſeth that
complaint, <hi>ô miſerable man that I am,
who ſhall deliuer mee from the bodie of this
death?</hi> After this complaint, wee eaſilie
perceive, that a godlie man hath his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
vnto Chriſt, &amp; in that in him he
hadde obteined deliuerance from his
ſinnes, whereof proceedeth that holy
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:10992:221"/>
giuing of thanks, <hi>I thank my God throgh
Ieſus Chriſt?</hi> Wherefore we come not
to the ſenſe of the feeling of Gods
mercy without a fighting, to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of God himſelf. And there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a glorious yſſue of our combate,
for it endeth in the glorifiing of God,
with an vnſpeakeable and glorious joy
Then next, the word of clenſing is to
be marked, whereby is ſignified a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
by ſome ſacrifice propiciatorie,
whereof he ſpeaketh. Pſalm. 51. 9. <hi>purge
me ô lord with byſſope,</hi> that is, by the holy
bloode of Chriſte, ſhaddowed out by
that figure. This worde therefore ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
that which is ſet down in <hi>Heb,
9. Without blood there is no forgiueneſſe of
ſinnes.</hi> For the fathers did not vnder
the lawe implore at any time mercy &amp;
pardon for their ſinnes without blood
&amp; ſacrifice to pacifie the wrath of God
Neither we our ſelues this day feele in

apprehended firſt by faith, neither yet
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:10992:221"/>

Calling within thoſe partes as it
were. The firſt is whereby God chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any man, that is, calleth him out
from the number of loſte men, vpon
this parte doeth that follow, whereby
he bringeth vs neerer, and maketh vs
to approch hard to himſelfe. For vnles
he himſelfe tooke holde of vs, &amp; drew
vs, as it were to himſelfe, ſurelie, being
called out, we ſhoulde not bee moved
out of our place. Vpon this finallie
doeth that part follow, which maketh
vs to dwell in his courtes. Our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

choiſe which God maketh, and it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:10992:222"/>
fordward by that drawing neere
vnto God, and at laſt it endeth in that
dwelling which is with GOD in his
Church. But the phraſe of ſpeach
which hee vſeth in vttering out of this
benefite of calling, is not to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted
in ſilence. For hee ſpeaketh
not this coldlie &amp; barelie, thou chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

of calling from the effects follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:10992:222"/>
The firſt is in Gods action to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them that are alreadie called bee
him. The ſeconde is in the worde of
God. As concerning the action, <hi>hee fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs</hi> (ſayeth hee) with good thinges
&amp; holy, as concerning the words thou
ſpeakeſt out vnto vs thinges to bee in
thy righteouſnes reuerenced. He who
receiueth anye man in ludgeing, and
ſetteth him at table, there are two
things ſummarilie that he is able to do
in entreating of his guheſt humanelie
and daintelie: Firſt in ſetting before
him the moſt delicate meate which he
may feede vpon, the other is in deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his eares, &amp; making his heart glad
with moſt pleaſant and glade ſpeeches
of all ſortes: GOD dothe both theſe
thinges to vs, whome hee hath once
called, and invited, hauing thought
vs worthie of his table. But the wordes
are ſomewhat more diligentlie to bee
conſidered. Of theſe thinges where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we are filled in the houſe of God
there are two properties, firſt they are
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:10992:223"/>
good and healthſome vnto vs: Then
they are holie; By theſe good and holy
thinges are all the ſpirituall bleſſinges
in Chriſt meante. Of, the wordes alſo
which hee ſpeaketh, there are likewiſe
two properties, the firſt is, that they are
reuerent, and therefore do require re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
at the hearers hands. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is, that they are in righteouſneſſe
that is, juſt, vpright and ſincere, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
falſhood, without lying. Alſo in
theſe words the promiſes of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
good and holy thinges are to
bee vnderſtood, greater they are then
we are able to comprehend in this life,
but we ſhall be capable of them in that
other life. You ſee then, with howe
great gladneſſe, with howe greate a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyſing
of heart, we haue our abode in
the houſe of God, and do ſit as it were
at his table who not onely are ioyfull
by faith of the goode thinges preſent,
that is, by the preſent apprehenſion of
them, but alſo by the hope of the bene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fites
to come, which will be farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:10992:223"/>
then thoſe preſent. Of theſe effects
wee ſee that, that <hi>David</hi> not without
cauſe publiſhed that man to be bleſſed,
whome God did chooſe. For what is
it to bee bleſſed, if this bee not, with ſo
great a joy and gladnes of ſoule, to bee
filled with thinges ſo good, ſo holy, &amp;
in the meane time to heare the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of things to come, exceeding great,
ſo reuerent, ſo righteous, ſo true. <hi>O God
of our ſaluation]</hi> There is two titles of
God heare, the one which reſpecteth
the Church: for ſaluation belongeth
to the Church. The other which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth
all thinges created, for confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is of al things created. Conſider
heare firſt then, as the goodnes of God
not onelie extendeth the ſelfe to the
Church, albeit chiefly to the Church,
but alſo to al things created, &amp; to theſe
alſo which are without the Churche
for he ſuffereth not yea euen the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be deſtitute of his teſtimony, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giuing vnto them raynes
from the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; fruitful ſeaſons, filling
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:10992:224"/>
their harts with food and gladnes.</hi> Euen ſo
the Godlie look vpon God, &amp; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
vppon his benefites towarde the
Church, but alſo in his benefites to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
All thinges created. Conſidder
nixt that there is ſome confidence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in God of the du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me and brutiſh cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>atures,
For in their owne faſhion they
thirſte for the grace of God, and haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gotten the ſame, in their owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
they repoſe themſelues quietlie in
their God, finally <hi>they wait with certaine
ſighes, the Reuelation of the ſonnes of God,
with whome they alſo ſhal be ſet at freedome</hi>
Of this matter looke Rom. 8. In which
place the hope of that glorye to come,
is not giuen to man, but to thoſe who
haue the firſt fruites of the ſpirit, but in
the ſame place, ſome hope notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the glorye to come is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the creatures, that you maye
ſee that the thinges create brutiſh and
dumme are in a better caſe, then men,
if they be not regenerated by the ſpirit
of GOD. <hi>[Stabliſhing the mountaines.]</hi>

                        <hi>O Iehoua]</hi> The firſt part of the pſalme
the complaint, in which the diuers
paſſions of <hi>Davids</hi> mind being baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
vtter themſelues. And firſt indeede
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:10992:225"/>
the affection of that loue whereby hee
embraceth Gods preſence in his
Church, is brought out in this verſe.
For <hi>David</hi> when he had felt that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe
of the preſence of GOD, which
then was tied vnto the Church of the
Iewes, he was taken with a wonderfull
loue thereof. Alſo hee openeth vp that
moſt tender loue in this word, <hi>[How a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable,]</hi>
For this word is the ſpeech of
a lover. By the name of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> he
vnderſtandeth that viſible Miniſtrie,
which then was bounde to the temple
of Ieruſalem onely, and in which God
exhibited himſelfe to his people to be
ſeene in ſome ſort. <hi>My ſoule is touched]</hi>
In this the paſſion of deſire vttereth
the ſelfe: For when the holy man was
baniſhed, from that preſence of GOD
which he ſo greatly loued, hee was not
touched with a meane deſire thereof.
For deſire properly ariſeth, of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of theſe thinges which we loue.
Conſidder therefore what it is to haue
once taiſted how gracious the Lord is,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:10992:226"/>
for of the taiſt commeth the loue, of
the loue ariſeth the deſire of the thing
abſent, which thinge the felle ſurelie is
neuer deſtitute of ſome ſorte of enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and preſence. <hi>Bleſſed are they that
hunger and thirſt for righteouſnes, becauſe
they ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> But they, who at no
time haue taiſted howe gracious the
Lorde is, they ſurelie are not taken
with his loue, and they who loue not,
they deſire not him that is abſent. For
what is the cauſe that you ſee manie
deſtitute of this viſible preſence of
God which is in his Miniſterie, &amp; not-with-ſtan-ding
are not ſo much, as by
the leaſte feeling, touched with the
ſenſe thereof. Theſe neuer taſted, how
ſweete this preſence of GOD was in
his miniſterie. From thence there is
no loue of God, againe from thence,
there is no deſire of him. But what
would you thinke of thoſe, which not
onely doe ſuffer themſelues willinglie
to be depriued of this preſence of God,
but alſo perſecute the ſame al the waies
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:10992:226"/>
they can? I pray you of what minde ar
thoſe men toward God, &amp; how wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
are they diſpoſed. <hi>[Yea my ſoule
fainteth]</hi> He aggravateth that his deſire
to come vnto God, and firſte indeede
from that, that through the deſire, his
minde fayleth him: Then from that,
that he is whollie occupied with that
deſire, both in his heart, in his fleſh, in
his minde, in his bodie: Thirdlie from
that, that through the deſire he cryeth
out. Marke therefore in this place, how
vehement the paſſion vſeth to be in the
godlie, not onlie of deſire, but of loue,
ſorrow and rejoyſing &amp;c. For that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of GOD, which ſtirreth vp this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the godly is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſible.
From thence his operation is maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in the hart, not ſuch natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motiones
indeede as vſe to bee in the
mind, as the naturall deſire, the natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
loue, the naturall ſorrow, &amp;c. From
thence the ſighes of the godlie are ſaid
to bee vnſpeakeable. <hi>Rom. 8,</hi> and the
joye vnutterable and glorious. <hi>1. Pet. 1</hi>
                        <pb n="392" facs="tcp:10992:227"/>
Neuertheles there is ſomething in the
affection of the godlie, which you may
vvounder at, and which you cannot
finde in the naturall paſſion: Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
is vehement, it is not without ſome
preſence and enjoying of that thing
which they deſire, from thence ariſeth
that pleaſure while they deſire. For
their ſighes cannot be expreſſed, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
they are not without ſome ioye, if
the vnſpeakeable ioy bee not conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with inutterable ſighes. <hi>[To the
ſtrong God.]</hi> Vnder theſe titles of God
there is ſome cauſe of ſo great a deſire,
for he felt that his whole power &amp; his
life was from God, who is both ſtrong
and liuing, that is, whoe is not onelie
ſtrong in himſelfe, but furniſheth
ſtrength vnto his creatures, not onelie
liueth himſelfe, but powreth in life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the things created: they then which
feele themſelues to liue by God, that
they moue and are, ſurelie they ſuffer
not themſelues to wante the preſence
of God: But they who feele not that
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:10992:227"/>
thing, they take that abſence of God in
a good ynough part. I grant, all liue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
and are by him, but all vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not that: onelie they vnderſtand
and feele that, who haue begun to liue
that life of God, &amp; haue the firſt fruites
of the Spirit. They indeede aſcribe to
God alone as his gifte, not onelie that
ſpirituall life, but euen the ſenſuall life,
<hi>[Yea the ſparrow.]</hi> The third affection.
Indignation, for he is angrie, yea that a
ſparrow or a ſwallow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall haue ſome
entrie to the altars of God: when not-with-ſtanding
the altares of GOD,
belong nothinge to thoſe litle
birdes: But he himſelfe which is a
member of the Church, all entrie vnto
the Church of God is vtterly ſtopped
vp. You ſee therefore that the Godlie,
being deſtitute of Gods preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, envie
that the little birdes ſhoulde haue the
ſame, and they thinke themſelues mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
in reſpect of the birdes. You
ſee alſo, that God by the birdes, doeth
after ſome ſorte prouoke men to aemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:10992:228"/>
The vngodlie in this life do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
eaſilie the things created and dum,
to draw neerer vnto god the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues,
and yet for all this, thinke not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in this reſpect, either more bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
or more miſerable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelues.
But when they ſhall come to that lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
judgement or to that aire, and to
thoſe clowdes, wherewith the Lorde
ſhall be invironed, and vpon which he
ſhall ſet miſerable men, they ſhall
thinke the birdes happie in reſpect of
themſelues. <hi>[My King and my God.]</hi>
Thoſe names of God, ſufficientlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that there was alſo ſome preſence
of God preſent at that time, when hee
ſo grieuouſlie complaineth of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
For theſe words proceede from
faith, that is, from ſome preſent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.
You will ſee then the godlie
complaine of the abſence of GOD,
when notwithſtanding they feele him
preſent in ſome ſorte. They complayn
alſo of his abſence, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get that preſence and communion
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:10992:228"/>
of God, which they would haue. For
we liue here by faith, and not by ſight,
that is, we looke a far off onely vppon
the Lorde, and that ſelfe ſame ſight,
which is from a farre off, is hindred
many waies; yea, many times alſo all
preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, is reſt away from our
eies. From thence ariſeth that deſire of
<hi>flitting out of this bodie, and going to dwell
with the Lord.</hi> From thence come theſe
complaints, concerning the Lords ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
<hi>Bleſſed are thoſe who dwel]</hi> This
is the fourth affection, woundring. He
cannot ſufficiently wounder at the
bleſſedneſſe of theſe men, who haue
ſome entry patent vnto God, that is, to
that viſible miniſterie, in which God
exhibited himſelf to be ſeene in ſome
ſort. For whoſoeuer at any time haue
God preſent with themſelues, thoſe
define that bleſſedneſſe, that felicity of
man, by that ſame preſence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
which is with God: Neither
ar they able at any time, who haue not
ſeene God in Chriſt, either to thinke
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:10992:229"/>
aright or ſpeak truly of that happines.
From thence proceed theſe ſhamefull
errours of prophane Philoſophers, of
which number, ſome haue beene ſo
mad, that they haue placed the miſerie
of man, in place of his happines. Alſo,
thoſe whom in the firſt place hee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
to bee bleſſed; thoſe appeare to
be the Levites and the Prieſtes. For
thoſe are they who dwelt in the houſe
of God, and according to their office,
perpetually prayſed him. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
therefore of the Church, obteine
the firſt place of happineſſe, and no
marvell indeede, if thou wilt meaſure
happineſſe by Gods preſence, and the
glorifying of his name. For the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
are ſanctified &amp; ſeparated aboue
others, to communicate with GOD;
vpon whom this thing lyeth as a parte
of their office, that they poynt out as it
were, with the finger, God whom they
firſt haue ſeene in Chriſt, and paynte
out Chriſt before the eies, to others
in the preaching of the Goſpell, and
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:10992:229"/>
crucifie him as it were to others: there
fore the faithfull Miniſters and ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
of the myſterie of Chriſt, ar chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
bleſſed; but if they be not faithfull,
they are of all men the moſt miſerable,
<hi>Bleſſed is the man]</hi> Secondly, he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
them to be bleſſed, who haue an
eaſie entrie into the Church of God:
For this is that which he ſayeth: <hi>Who
in thee haue libertie of thy pathes]</hi> For
here alſo is the matter of happines, that
there is an eaſie paſſage made vnto vs,
to the aſſemblies of the Church, in
which the worde of God is heard and
preached, and the Sacraments are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred:
But wee very oft, fulfill that
which is commonly ſpoken; The nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
that wee draw to the Temple of
God in our bodie; wee are the farther
in our ſoule from God; and we abuſe
that libertie and power, in which there
is any matter of bleſſednes: For wee
haue taken a loathing of the worde of
God, and of the Eccleſiaſticall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
long ſince. <hi>Bleſſed are they]</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:10992:230"/>
hee counteth theſe among the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
who, howbeit they had a hard way
&amp; a droughthie place to paſſe through
as was the valley of the mulberie, are
compelled to journey, &amp; likewiſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
in a raynie weather: Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
they are able to come vnto the
Church of God: <hi>Appoynt that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine]</hi>
That is, they refreſh themſelues
with a conſideration of that fountaine
of GOD, vnto the which, they ſtriue
through thoſe droughthie places, <hi>The
rayne of thy bleſsing.]</hi> That is, which for
the moſt parte, is ſent to communicate
the bleſſing of God with the earth, &amp;
maketh it fertil. Thou ſeeſt then that
thoſe are bleſſed, to whome otherwiſe
there is an hard entry into the Church
of GOD, if in the meane time they
come vnto him: For the difficultie of
comming vnto God, taketh not away
our happineſſe, if ſobeit at length wee
take holde on him. But theſe ſurely are
the meet judges of this happines, who
haue once taſted, howe gracious the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:10992:230"/>
Lorde is, and what greate ſweetnes
is in his preſence. <hi>They goe from battle
array]</hi> The reaſon of their bleſſednes,
who haue an vneaſie waye vnto the
Church of God, from the event. <hi>They
go</hi> (ſayeth he] <hi>from battel aray, to battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray]</hi>
That is, after they are commed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, that difficil way being
accompliſhed, they paſſe from one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſembly to another daylie, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
publickly, the whole worſhippe of
GOD. It is a borrowed ſpeech from
warfare. <hi>Let every man compeare]</hi> This
is done according to the Lawe. Hee
ſheweth evidently then their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
who haue an hard journey vnto
the Church, from the notable iſſue; for
wee muſt meaſure bleſſedneſſe from
the iſſue, and not from the meanes,
whereby wee attaine vnto the iſſue.
And therefore our Saviour in the fifth
of Matthew ſaieth, <hi>Bleſſed are they that
mourne, for they ſhal be comforted,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee ſignifieth, that bleſſednes is not
ſo much in the mourning, as it is in the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:10992:231"/>
conſolation: Not-with-ſtanding, hee
ſheweth that mourning is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
midds for comfort, ſo that if wee
mourne not in this life, there ſhall be
no comforte for vs in that that is to
come, vnles we paſſe as it were in ſome
ſort through the Helles, wee ſhall not
come vnto the Heavens.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>O Iehova]</hi> Now hee pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vnto GOD, that of his mercy hee
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:10992:231"/>
would bring him home from baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into his Church: The petition
is conteined in two verſes: The reaſon
therof is vnto the 13. verſe. The ground
of the petition, vppon the which it is
built, is eaſilie perceived from the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
and names, whereby hee incalleth
God. Alſo, the ground of the petition
firſte, is indeede in taking holde on
GOD in his everlaſting eſſence, from
whence hee is called Iehova: Then
next, in that his infinite power, from
whence hee is called, the GOD of
hoſtes, and that he hath vnder his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
al hoſtes and armies; aſwel the
heavenly, as the earthly. Thirdly, in
his mercy, which he hath made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in that covenant, made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iakob,</hi> from whence hee
is called, the God of <hi>Iahakob.</hi> For wee
cannot pray vnto God, except we take
holde on him in our heart, not only in
that his everlaſting eſſence, wherby he
is diſtinguiſhed, from all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but alſo in his proprieties, but
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:10992:232"/>
chiefely in two; power, whereby he is
able to ſaue vs, and mercy, whereby he
is willing to ſaue vs. Alſo, we vtter this
apprehenſion of heart, in the titles and
names of God, while wee call him Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova,
ſometime the God of armies, at
other times, the God of <hi>Iahakob;</hi> and
finallie, when wee are praying, we call
vpon him by other titles. It is to be
marked in the petition, that hee repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the ſelfe ſame petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſheweth evidently, the earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of the thing ſought for, without
the which, wee ſhould not call vppon
God, for the deſire of the heart, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
neceſſary foundation of praiers.
From thence aryſe thoſe vehement
and repeated petitions, the which ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
askings againe, of neceſſitie, God
muſt heare. But if there be not a deſire
of the heart, the askings are but colde
and drye, and therefore againe they
get nothing but a colde &amp; a drye aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
from God, and procure rather
ſome judgement, then any benefite.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:10992:232"/>
For we ſhould not deale for the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſake with God. <hi>O our ſhield]</hi> How
of the craveth, ſo oft he calleth vppon
God moſt reverently, which thing, is
an evidente, that every one of theſe
words proceed from particular appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of the heart. Men commonly
when they ſpeake to ſuperiour pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
they vſe oft and honorable ſtyles;
but for the moſt part fayned ſtyles. But
the godly, when they ſpeake reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnto God, they ſpeake from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
ſincerity, reverence, faith and loue
of the heart. For wee muſt deale with
GOD, the ſearcher of the hearts, with
vprightnes of heart, and not make our
word ſo much as our ſoule approoved
vnto him, and this cannot bee done
without his owne ſpirit: For no man
calleth Ieſus Chriſt, but by the holie
Spirite <hi>[Behold]</hi> As he firſt ſought the
eare, ſo nowe hee deſireth the eie of
GOD: For the godly are not at reſte
within themſelues, before they firſte
feele, that all the ſenſes of their God, as
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:10992:233"/>
it were, are exerciſed vppon them; for
even as they, who favoure not but of
thoſe earthly things, ſome not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
able to liue, vnles they haue the
eare of the Princes of this world open
vnto them, and haue their eie fixed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them: ſo they who ſeek that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life, they depend altogether v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the eie and eare of God, who is
the alone author of life, and in whoſe
face there is ſacietie of joyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For one
day is]</hi> This is the argument of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
from that joye which is in the
Church of God. Of this joy he entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
by way of compariſon, and he ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregeth
it by a compariſon taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a thing that is leſſe, of that joy which is
in the pavillions of wickednes, that is,
which is without the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which, there is nothing but
wickedneſſe: as if he ſhould ſaye, The
joye of one daye in the Church, is
more then the joy of a thouſand daies
without the Church; from thence hee
concludeth: <hi>Therefore I had rather hant
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:10992:233"/>
the threſhold in the houſe of God, &amp;c.</hi> Hee
preferreth then the joye of one day in
the Church, to the joy of many dayes
without the Church. The reaſon is,
becauſe the weight &amp; quantity of that
ſpiritual joye which is in the Church,
recompenſeth the ſhortneſſe of the
time: For one crumme, if it were no
more of that ſpirituall joy, is of greater
weight &amp; eſtimation, then is the whole
joy of this world. Marke, if ſo little a
time of ſpirituall gladneſſe, begun but
onely in this fighting Church vppon
earth, ſurpaſſeth by ſo many degrees,
that whole time of the joy, which is of
this world; I pray you, how much ſhal
wee ſay the eternitie of that ſpirituall
ioy to be, which at length is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
in the triumphant Church, to be
more excellent, I ſay, then all the joye
of this worlde, which laſteth but for a
moment as it were? For the whole
time of this joy, if it be compared with
eternitie, what other thing is it, then a
certaine moment, and that gladnes of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:10992:234"/>
the world, if it be compared with that
heavenly ioy, how vaine and light is
it? Compare therfore, that everlaſting
weight, of that excellently excellent
glorie, ſo to ſpeake with the Apoſtle,
with this momentanean lightneſſe of
worldly ioye.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4</note> The Prophet ſaid not
greate ioye, which is in the Church,
when he brought in the cauſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

That is, who are truly and really of the

this <hi>Pauls</hi> approbation? ſurely
from that loue of his Lord, who as hee
ſayeth in the ſame Chapter, verſe 14.
<hi>The loue of Chriſt conſtrayned him,</hi> and
continually carryed him forward vnto
the Lord. And this is the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſighing, wait for the comming
of Chriſt: For the loue whereby wee
embrace Chriſt, earneſtly thirſteth for
that conjunction with Chriſt. There is
alſo another thing that is required in
this loue, that is, that for the loue of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:10992:237"/>
Chriſt, wee would be willing to looſe
the moſt deare things whatſoever we
haue in this life. So Chriſt ſpeaketh in
<hi>Luke:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 14. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>If any man come vnto me, and hate
not his father and mother, and wife and
children, and brethren and ſiſters, yea, and
his own life alſo, he cannot be my Deſciple.</hi>
By which wordes, Chriſt ſignifieth,
that his loue is to be bought, yea, with
the hatred of thoſe thinges which are
moſt deare, if it can no otherwiſe be
obteined. And this indeede was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
loue, which hee profeſſeth in this
place. Such ſhould al our loue be, who
profeſſe the ſame God with him. And
in this reſpect wee are chiefely moſt
happie, becauſe wee haue that God of
<hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iahakob,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
whom we may loue, whome wee
may worſhip. <hi>For he heareth]</hi> This is an
argument of loue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the benefite of
his deliverance, from whence aroſe a
certain earneſt feling of the mercie of
God toward him. Marke then, that
the knowledge of the goodnes of God,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:10992:238"/>
and the ſenſe of his mercy and loue
towarde vs, continually goeth before
our loue toward him. <hi>He loueth vs</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
IOHN) <hi>not becauſe we haue loued him
firſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4. 19.</note> For it is impoſſible that any man
can loue God, vnleſſe that now firſte
<hi>that loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus, be powred
out in his heart by the holy Spirit. Dauid</hi> in
every place profeſſeth his loue toward
God,<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 5.</note> hee giveth an account thereof
continually from the mercy of God
toward him. <hi>I wil loue thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
my very moſt inward bowels,</hi> And what
is the reaſon?<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Iehova is my ſtrength, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova
is my rocke and my ſtrong tower, &amp;c.</hi>
By which words indeed, he declareth
the cauſe wherefore hee ſo much lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
GOD, that it was the mercy of
God toward him. But if verely we wil
loue God (for except we loue him, we
are miſerable) and if we will ſet our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
vpon God, we haue neede of
nothing ſo much then of diligent mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of all his benefites, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
heapeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. For theſe ar ſo
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:10992:238"/>
many teſtimonies of gods loue toward
vs. Now wee haue ſaid, that the loue
of God towarde vs, is the cauſe of our
loue toward him. Wherefore, to the
end that wee may loue God from our
ſoule, every particular benefite of God,
ſo farre as it is poſſible, is to be marked
by vs. For ſurely the cauſe wherefore
our harts burne not in that loue, where
in they ought to burne towards God,
proceedeth from this, that we conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſo ſlightlie his benefites toward vs,
eſpecially that greateſt benefite of all,
the benefite of our Redemption in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt; for while his benefites are
nor weighed, there is no ſenſe of his
loue toward vs. And when there is not
a feeling of his loue towarde vs, howe
can it come to paſſe, that wee can loue
him? <hi>He heareth my deprecation]</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the prayers went before the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
of God, and the ſenſe of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
For by thoſe degrees, we come as it
were vnto the loue of God. Firſt wee
ſeek at Gods hands any benefite, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:10992:239"/>
it be Temporal or Spiritual. Then
after we haue gotten the benefite, wee
feel his mercy &amp; loue toward vs, as the
fountain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which that benefite flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Finally, from that ſenſe of the loue
of God toward vs, that our loue again
towrad him aryſeth. Wherefore, to the
ende, that any man may earneſtly loue
the Lord, his prayers ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall;
for of continuall prayers and
ſupplications, continuall benefites of
God come vnto vs, which are ſo many
teſtimonies of that his loue toward vs
in Chriſt. <hi>For he hath bowed]</hi> Hee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vp at greater length, the reaſon
immediatly preceeding of his loue, &amp;
he abydeth in amplifying thereof, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the 7. verſe. <hi>In my dayes]</hi> Hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
the dayes of affliction and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
as the verſe following maketh
manifeſt. In this meaning, the word of

who hath gotten but only the Spirite

Iehoua</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>deliver my ſoule]</hi> Then
he craveth deliverance. Marke then,
When affliction oppreſſed <hi>David</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and ſorrow within, that is, his
affaires were no waies in an good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:10992:241"/>
neither was the diſpoſition of his
mind quiet, then God would not take
<hi>David</hi> out of this life, being thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed
&amp; afflicted. For if death had ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
vppon him, being thus afflicted,
ſurely not onely the preſent life, but
the life to come had bene brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
danger. But, having firſt ſent his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
he reformed <hi>Davids</hi> mind within,
and bowed it to prayers. Then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him out of danger. Mark then,
that the godly are oft brought to an
extreame danger, yea, not only exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
but alſo they are in an evill caſe
within, and are at ſome times driven
into a certaine deſpaire, in the which,
they being now placed, if God would
bereaue them of this life, or would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to be oppreſſed, they ſhould
be in daunger to looſe that other life.
But God vſeth thus to deale with his
owne, that hee taketh them not out of
this life, except they be well diſpoſed
in ſome meaſure in their ſoule, &amp; well
furniſhed with his Spirit: When con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:10992:242"/>
he ſuffereth the wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an evill caſe, and driven into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to periſh, their ſouls not being
turned vnto him, before their laſte
breath go out. Obſerue ſecondly: We
ſee that <hi>Davids</hi> laſt refuge is here vnto
God. Good and evill men are alike
ſubject vnto the afflictions of this life,
before they come vnto the laſt daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the wicked appeare ever to be in
the better eſtate, for all things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
vnto this worldly life, are for the
moſt parte readie at their hande, yea,
they haue very many deliverances:
But when they come to the laſt daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and when all the helpes of this
worlde fayle, then the godly are in ane
over farre better caſe, and whoſoever
they be that put their truſt in GOD;
for God is a refuge vnto them: But the
vngodly ar driven into deſpaire. <hi>Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Iehova]</hi> Here followeth the effecte
of <hi>Davids</hi> petition, deliverance out of
the preſent perrill. <hi>When</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>I
was vtterly brought downe, God beſtowed
<pb facs="tcp:10992:242"/>
ſalvation vpon me.</hi> He ſpeaketh not this
rawlie and coldly, but hee deſcribeth
his God accordingly to the purpoſe;
firſt from his grace, juſtice and mercy;
then from a general effect of theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<hi>Gracious]</hi> God is called gracious, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe
of his meere grace, without the
deſerving of men, he beſtoweth vpon
vs, all his benefites. He is called <hi>[lust]</hi>
becauſe he is true and faithfull in his
promiſes. For Iuſtice, if at any time it
bee conjoyned with deliverance (as
when it is ſaide, that God is juſte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he delivereth vs) then faithfulnes
is to be ſeene in the promiſes: As Pſal.

Pſal. 51. <hi>Deliver me from bloud, ô God, the

becauſe he regardeth the miſerie

mans helpe and counſell, and who in a
ſingle minde, recommend themſelues
vnto God. This deſcription of God, is
applyed to the following effect of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
deliverance. For thoſe godly men,
if at any time they haue made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any worke of GOD, they deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
God the worker thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as it aggreed with the worke, and
they called him, either juſt or power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
or wiſe or merciful. <hi>Paule</hi> going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to ſpeake of quickning,<note place="margin">Epheſa. 4.</note> aſwell of
the Iewes, as of the Gentiles: firſt hee
deſcribed God, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cauſe of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to witte, from his mercy. <hi>God</hi> (ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
he) <hi>who is rich in mercy, becauſe of his
great loue, whereby hee hath loved vs, hee
hath quickened vs together with Chriſt.</hi>
That is, hee had conſiddered diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
the benefite of quickning, and felt
it intirely in his ſoule. From thence he
aſcendeth, to the cauſe it ſelfe, to wit,
to the mercy of God. For they who

of God, thoſe ſame men alſo, doe
not les ſeriouſlie panſe of the cauſes &amp;

weightie of God; ſo that wee may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yea, of the very naming of God,
how much men are mooved with the
workes of GOD, if at any time they
ſpeake of them. For if in the meane

God, they name not God with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
which is due, ſurelie that is an

Wherefore of neceſſitie, here he
hath a reſpect to another deliverance,
and to another life, then to this that is
preſent. For it is not likely to be true,
that ſo godly a man gloryed ſo much
of this temporall life, in which none of
the godly at any time, ever contented
themſelues. But to the end I may ſpeak

For <hi>Samuel</hi> ſheweth vnto mee, that I

that he hath ſpoken of his owne fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

but <hi>Samuel</hi> of a lie, as if he had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

the affaires of the faithfull are, ſo

through weakneſſe, they are thruſte
down even to the helles: Then again,
they are lifted vp by faith, vnto the

faiths. <hi>David</hi> after that through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
he had almoſt blaſphemed. Then
next, through faith againe hee trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed.
It may come to paſſe indeede,
that the fleſh in the firſt combat haue
the maiſtery as it were, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaketh. Rom. 7. <hi>The law of the
members, maketh the man captiue to the
law of ſin, which is in the members:</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the faithfull perpetually
feele this in themſelues, that the laſte
victory is of the holy Spirit, which ſure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
is an evident, that the fleſh at length
ſhall be vtterly vanquiſhed, &amp; that the
full and perfite victory ſhal belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Spirite. This is not in the meane
time to be paſſed by here, that <hi>David</hi>
in glorying, vttereth a notable confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
to wit, becauſe there was before
a great weakneſſe: For in the combat
of the fleſh and the Spirite, the more
that any man is caſt downe through a
feeling of his infirmitie, in that reſpect
he is the more lifted vp through faith:
The greater the ſorow be in the wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:10992:248"/>
in that reſpect the joy and gladnes
through the holy Spirite, is greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fight. Finally, this is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiddered,
that he ſayth, that haſtening
thoſe thinges which were ſpoken by
him, that is, he was mooved through a
certaine ſuddaine motion of the fleſh.
Of the which, mark the difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuixt
that infidelity, into the which the
godly at ſometime fal, &amp; the infidelity
of the wicked &amp; rebellious. The godly
at ſometime diſtruſt through a certain

                        </gap>leſh &amp; weaknes.
So <hi>Peter</hi> through infirmitie, denied the
Lord: &amp; in the very misbeleefe it ſelf,
they feele ſome dolor, &amp; they diſtruſt
not ſo ſecurly, but burſt forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into thoſe ſpeeches: <hi>O miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man that I am, who ſhal deliuer me from
the body of this death!</hi> Contrariwiſe, the
vngodly, they misbeleeue God, not of
any ſuddaine motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fleſh, but of
an obſtinate malice, as thoſe did, who
aſcribed the works of Chriſt, vnto the
divell; &amp; all Heretickes, who after they
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:10992:249"/>
are convict, by the teſtimonies of the
Scripture; notwithſtanding, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſlie
reſiſt the trueth. And from
this it proceedeth, that the vngodlie,
who diſtruſt through malice, ſeldome
attayne they to mercy: the godly, who
misbeleeue through the weakneſſe of
the fleſh, they repente and finde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Heretickes are ſeldome converted.
<hi>Peter</hi> was converted, <hi>David</hi> obteined

Pſalme, in which hee taketh adviſe
concerning rendring of thankes vnto
God. In conſulting, he ſignifieth and
profeſſeth, that hee is not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe
ſo many his great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
benefites; as if he ſhould ſaye: It
lyeth not in my power to recompenſe

that they are able to be recompenſed

that hee is not able to recompenſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova;
that is, to recompenſe his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
toward him. Then he rendreth a
reaſon, from the greatneſſe of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
of God. For the vnequal or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing

conſidered vpon the other part, being
overcome by the incomparable great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

It lyeth not in my power, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
ſo many and ſo greate benefites
of God. Then the argument is taken,
not onely from the greatneſſe of the
benefites of GOD, but alſo from his
owne inhabilitie, weakneſſe, and little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(to ſpeake ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) In one worde, the

that there is no correſpondence and

this propoſition, it is neceſſarie,
that wee repeate ſome-what out of

Arke was brought in into the citty of
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:10992:252"/>
Ieruſalem by <hi>David:</hi> we reade that he
did two things: To wit, the firſt, that
he offered burnt offering and ſacrifices
of thankſgiving vnto God. The other,
that hee made an holy feaſte vnto the
people, in a remembrance of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of God received. In this place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſayth, that he wil do both theſe
things. For that ſpeech belongeth to a
feaſt, <hi>I will</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>giue openly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
cup of all ſalvation]</hi> That is, I will
make an holy feaſt vnto the people, in
memory of all my deliverances, and I
wil propone the cup to be drunken to
all men, in a perpetuall remembrance
of my deliverances. Then next, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the burnt offerings and the
ſacrifices of thankſgiving, he ſaith, that
hee will offer them in theſe wordes,
when he ſayeth, <hi>I will prayſe the name of
Iehoua, I wil paye my vowes vnto Iehova,
&amp;c.]</hi> As concerning the vowes, this
onelie we are put in minde concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, that they ſerue our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Firſte, in perrilles they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:10992:252"/>
the faith of our deliverances;
For, fra once wee haue turned our

wee conceiue a ſurer hope of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Then they ſtirre vs vppe more
to Thankeſ giving, after that nowe
wee are delivered, for being bounde
by a vowe, we feele that there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
layde vppon vs, to render
Thankes vnto GOD. In vowes wee
muſt chiefely beware, that they bee
not of thinges vnlawfull, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the worde of GOD, ſuch
as are at this daye; Thoſe of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
and Monkes, where-by they
ſerue not GOD, but tempt GOD;
they eaſe not their owne weakneſſe;
but laye a greater and weightier bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
vppon it: Such a vowe amongſt
the reſte, was that concerning ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of life. The thinge that occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in this place to bee marked firſte,
is that, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ee firſt acknowledgeth,
howe that his dutie towarde GOD is
nothing, in regarde of the greatneſſe
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:10992:253"/>
of the benefites of GOD, then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth
to giue Thankes; by which
method, wee are put in minde of the
acknowledging of our weakneſſe,
whereby wee are not ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe
the benefites of God, that
there preceedeth an earneſt giving of
thankes. For that man ſhall never ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
and from his heart, giue thanks
to any man for the benefite received,
which is led with an opinion of his
owne ſtrength, whereby in very deed
he may recompenſe the benefit. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
any puiſſant man hath received anye
benefite from a man leſſe mightie and
poor, he thinketh not the man worthy
of any thankſgiving: For hee thinketh
that hee is not onely able to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
the like, but alſo far more, when
it pleaſeth him: Contrariwiſe, anie
poore man having received a benefite
from a man more mightie, he is guilty
within himſelfe of his owne povertie,
that he hath no power to recompenſe
him againe, the thing that he onely is
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:10992:253"/>
able to doe, he doth, it in giving thanks
by worde. That Phariſee, who toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Publican, went vp into
the Temple, that hee might pray vnto
the Lord; he prayed indeede, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to theſe words: <hi>I giue thee thanks,
that thou haſt not made me like other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
men, robbers, adulter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rs, nor yet
alſo like this Publican:</hi> (for hee poynted
out the man with his finger, ſtanding
farre off from him) then he adjoyneth;
<hi>I faſt twiſe in the weeke, I paye my tenthes.</hi>
Not onely would he giue thankes for
the benefites received from God, but
hee would alſo enter in count and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
with God, what hee had given
him, and received from him: Even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
as if he had recompenſed thoſe
benefites that he had mentioned, hee
had gotten from God, with his duties
againe toward God. But what did hee
bring to paſſe by ſuch a thankſgiving?
what profited he thereby? Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>he returned home not iuſtified,</hi> which was
the earand wherefore hee came: That
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:10992:254"/>
all men learne, that in the meane time,
they are giving thanks vnto God, not
to put their confidence in any of their
owne deſervings, neither yet to vaunt
of their own righteouſnes before God;
as if they not onely by their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
had recompenſed the benefites of
God toward them, but alſo had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſomewhat at Gods hand. Wee are
againe taught here, that the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
of our own weaknes &amp; pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diligent examining
and weighing of the benefits of God.
Alſo, from a conſideration of our gifts
whether they are able to anſwer to ſo
many &amp; ſo great benefits of god: wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
ſo at laſt, we ſhal feel how vnable,
yea, that wear nothing, if we wil weigh
the benefits of God toward vs, and our
ſtrength &amp; gifts together, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
them among themſelues. For it
will ſo come to paſſe at length, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diligently conſidered, that great
inequality of the benefits of God, &amp; of
our ſtrength, we ſhal acknowledg how
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:10992:254"/>
many &amp; how great in lacks there ar in
vs, &amp; how vnable wee are to repay the
Lord again: Wilt thou therefore from
thine heart giue thanks vnto God, and
aſcriue ſolidly &amp; altogether, al the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his benefits to himſelf? acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
how poore thou art in thy ſelf, &amp;
how thou haſt nothing to recompenſe
the Lord withal: now wilt thou know
this thing? examin diligently &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare
the benefits of God, &amp; thy giftes and
ſtrength among themſelues. And if we
ſhuld proceed after this order in giving
God thanks, ſurely wee would give all
the glory to God of his benefits, more
earneſtly from the hart, &amp; more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
then we vſe to do. Again, marke
here in <hi>Dauid,</hi> the token of a thankfull
minde: he voweth vnto God, &amp; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payeth
his vow. This thankfulneſſe in
promiſing, &amp; the accompliſhment of
the promiſe, is not to bee reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the leaſt of Gods benefits. For it
proceedeth from the ſpeciall favour of
God, that wee are thankfull to GOD
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:10992:255"/>
for the benefite receiued. For wee are
almoſt all more prone after ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
earneſtly to craue Gods helpe, &amp;
to liue vnto him, when we are preſſed
with any grievous perrill, then wee are
to giue thanks, and to paye our vowes
vnto God; after that already, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
of God are beſtowed vppon vs.
Notwithſtanding, the Prophete war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
that thoſe two are to be joyned
together, with an inſeparable knot. Pſ.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thy vowes to the moſt High, and cal vppon
me in the time of anguiſh, I will deliver
thee, that thou mayeſt honour mee.</hi> Surely
I thinke that that man hath not ſought
any thing at God earneſtly, and with
that heart with which it became him,
who after that he now hath obteined
the ſame, is vnmindfull of the benefite
and of Thankſgiving. For that ſelfe
ſame ſpirite, which teacheth <hi>vs to praye
as is requiſite, and maketh interceſsion for
vs, with ſighes that cannot bee expreſſed,</hi>
teacheth vs to giue thanks vnto God
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:10992:255"/>
for the benefites received, &amp; that with
ane certaine vnſpeakable joy &amp; glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of heart. Laſt, it is marked here,
that this was the higheſt degree of
thankſgiving, that <hi>David</hi> promiſeth
here vnto his God. For an exceeding
great benefite, requireth exceeding
great thankſgiving. Alſo, paſſing great
thanks are not theſe which are given
to God ſecretly, but thoſe that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
publickly. The whole Church of
God looking on and hearing <hi>David,</hi>
if at any time he promiſeth or offereth
a chiefe duty vnto God, hee profeſſeth
that hee is not able to offer or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
a greater duty nor this, then that
he will prayſe God in the publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of his Church. For the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
giving of Thanks is more then the
private. For while thou giveſt thankes
publickly vnto God, the whole people
ſayeth, <hi>Amen;</hi> And ſo they glorifie
God together with thee. From thence
it is, that God would haue his people
togather together in one, and to giue
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:10992:256"/>
him thanks together in the Church, to
the end, that the greater praiſe, honour
and glory may redounde vnto him.
<hi>Precious in the, &amp;c.]</hi> This is that forme
of thankſgiving, which hee ſetteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him to bee followed. Firſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth
the Providence of God
toward his owne, aſwell in their life, as
in their death. Then hee confirmeth
this providence of God, from his own
experience. Firſt therefore, ſayeth hee,
<hi>the death is precious]</hi> Men do common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinke, while they ſee the godly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and exerciſed with ſundrie ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities;
they thinke, I ſay, that God at
that time taketh no thought of them,
whether they liue or die. And from
thence it is, that the perſecutors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
thinking, that God taketh a like
litle care of their life &amp; death; they wax
the more fearce againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as againſt
as many vile and abject ſlaues. <hi>David</hi>
therefore oppoſeth, to the perverſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of men, in this place, this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
paſſage, <hi>precious in the ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s of Iehoua]</hi>
                        <pb n="451" facs="tcp:10992:256"/>
&amp;c. Whereby hee ſignifieth, firſt, that
God many times, permitteth not his
owne to die, but delivereth them very
oft out of exceeding great dangers, &amp;
reſcueth them as it were, out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
jawes of death. Then next, by this
paſſage he ſignifyeth, that if God at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time ſuffereth his owne to die, that
commeth not paſſe, by Chaunce or
Fortune, but by the ſure purpoſe of
God. Pilate after this manner ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, even as if God had taken no
reſolute adviſe concerning his life or
death. <hi>Knoweſt thou not</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>that
I haue power to crucifie thee, yea, alſo power
to lowſe thee?</hi> Chriſt aunſwereth him:
<hi>Thou ſhouldeſt haue no power at all over
mee, vnleſſe it were given thee from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue.</hi>
Thus much ſpeaketh Chriſte.
Thirdly, by this paſſage is ſignified,
that the croce &amp; death of the godly it
ſelf, howſoeuer it be vile in the ſight of
men, notwithſtanding it is precious in
the eies of GOD. Laſte, this ſentence
admoniſheth, that after the godlie are
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:10992:257"/>
already dead and taken out of this life,
by the permiſſion of God, &amp; violence
of the vngodly together; GOD ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not their death, to ſlip out of his
remembrance at any time: For ſeeing
that is moſte true, that <hi>hee hath all the
teares of his owne, put vp in a bottle,</hi> as it
were, and in regiſter, howe many they
are; howe much more will he haue the
whole blood of the godly, yea, &amp; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular drop alſo of their bloud
kept cloſe with him? Yea ſurely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo much as any one drop of the
blood of the godly ſhould periſh, hee
will command the earth it ſelfe, which
opening her owne mouth, the time it
was ſhed, received it and drank it in,
he will command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, the very earth
it ſelf to keep it in her womb as it were,
vnto that day of the Lords viſitation,
wherein he wil take a vengeance vpon
all them, whoſoever haue perſecuted
the godly in this life. After theſe foure
divers faſhions therefore, to ſpeake it
it ſummarlie, the death of the godlie
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:10992:257"/>
is pretious in the ſight of God: firſt, that
he ſuffereth not his own oft to periſh,
but delivereth them out of exceeding
great dangers. Then, if he permitteth
them to die, that is, not done raſhly, &amp;
without a moſt weighty cauſe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the very death of the godly it
ſelfe, howſoever it ſeeme vile in the
ſight of the world; notwithſtanding, in
Gods ſight it is precious. Fourthly, that
continually the memory of the death
of the godly is alwaies freſh &amp; recent.
Of theſe foure manners, that firſt is
chiefly to be vnderſtood in this place:
To wit, that for this cauſe the death of
Gods owne is precious in the eies of
God, he ſuffereth, in reſpect them, not
many times to die, but delivereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
out of extreame great daungers. But
whoſe death is precious in the eies of
Iehova? Even the death of thoſe, ſaith
he, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beareth at good wil. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the loue and favour of God is the
cauſe, wherefore the death of his own
is precious; &amp; thoſe whom he loveth,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:10992:258"/>
he keepeth them aliue, neither doth he
at any time ſuffer them to die raſhlie.
Any would ſuddenly wounder at the
firſt ſhew, why God hath not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but alſo hath commanded oft,
that ſo many Nations ſhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
no choiſe being had of men,
wemen, and infants; which thing wee
reade in the booke of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> come to
paſſe, vpon the people which were in
the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> When I was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
in ſeeking out ſomewhat more
profoundly, the cauſe of this ſo greate
a ſeveritie; this firſt came in my minde,
becauſe God favored not thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but contrariwiſe hee hated them;
whereby it came to paſſe, that their
death was not precious in the eies of
God. If their precious death, or not
precious death. dependeth vppon the
loue or hatred of God; how bleſſed are
thoſe, whome the Lord loveth, aſwell
in life as in death? <hi>I beſeech thee Iehoua]</hi>
Hee confirmeth Gods providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his own, by his own experience:
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:10992:258"/>
as if he ſhould ſaye, haſt thou not, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
thee ô Iehova lowſed my bondes]</hi> For
he ſpeaketh of himſelfe, as if hee were
drawen bound hand and foote to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
For he meaneth, that hee was
brought to an extreame daunger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his life, when by Iehova he was de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>livered.
He ſubjoyneth the cauſe of his
deliverance, to wit, that he was the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of Iehova, &amp; for this cauſe a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
becauſe he was the ſon of a hand
maid: for the ſonnes of the handmaid,
are therewithall, according to the law,
ſervants; When he ſayeth that he is the
ſonne of an hand maid, hee ſignifieth,
that he is not a ſtranger &amp; a ſervant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from far, but a houſhold ſervant
among the reſt of Gods domeſtickes.
Hee meaneth then, that he is not a man
that is a ſtranger &amp; a ſojorning ſervant
in the houſe of god, but that he himſelf
hath ſome right &amp; title in the houſe of
god, either fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his parents, which befor
him wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed within the covenant
of God: for that is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon benefit of
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:10992:259"/>
that we are borne as it were, of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticques
and confederates of God.
And ſurely the affection of <hi>Davids</hi>
mind, vttereth the ſelfe clearely in this
gradation of words as it were: For the
wordes ſhew, that the affection of the
minde, approched vnto God more &amp;
more: For firſt he ſayeth, <hi>I am thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:</hi>
This is the firſt degree or ſteppe
of the words, and the firſt approching
of the ſoule vnto God: Then he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
the felfe ſame thing, and he ſaith,
<hi>I am thy ſervant]</hi> This is the ſeconde
ſtep of the wordes, and the ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching
of his ſoule vnto God: Then
he ſayeth in the third place, <hi>I am the
ſonne of thine hand-maid.]</hi> This is the
third ſtep of the words, and chief ſigne
of his exceeding great and third draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neere vnto God. For while he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this laſt, hee coupleth himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
with GOD, and he cleaveth
ſtraitly vnto him; and ſo for this cauſe
he becommeth bleſſed: For our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
conſiſteth in that communion
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:10992:259"/>
and fellowſhip with God. Thou feeſt
therefore, that thing in this place; firſt,
from whence it proceedeth, that hee
publickly reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth, with ſo great
a confidence of mind, that providence
of God toward his owne: Surely it
commeth from that his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and of the particular providence
of God toward him ſelfe. For no man
can prayſe generally, the providence
and mercy of God toward his owne
Church, except he hath in particular,
felt the ſame in experience himſelfe:
Certainly that ſaying would haue bin
but coldly ſpoken by <hi>Paule,</hi> To witte,
<hi>that Chriſt came into the World to ſaue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
vnleſſe that he himſelfe had firſte
felt in experience, both the miſerie of
ſinne, and the mercy of God; and for
this cauſe he ſubjoyneth theſe words,
<hi>Of whom</hi> (to witte of ſinners) <hi>I am the
chiefeſt,</hi> to the end he might conclude
in his own conſcience, that he himſelf
was ſaved by Chriſt. Therefore, that
generall faith of the Papiſts is vnmeet
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:10992:260"/>
to recommend the providence &amp; grace
of God toward his owne Church. For
never did I ever yet eſteeme at anie
time, any Papiſt to be a meet Preacher;
or publiſher of the benefits of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
his Church; who is not able to
bring out any thing from his own fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or experience; who is not able to
ſay that, of the which before we haue
ſpoken in this Pſalme, <hi>I beleeued, and
therefore did I ſpeake.</hi> Marke ſecondly:
There ar men whom this or that kinde
of death doth greatly vexe and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as violent death, as filthie, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
exquiſite, and cruell deathes;
concerning which ſortes of death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,

but preſently they are ſtriken with

This is that our onely comforte
in life and death, that wee are not our
own, but our moſt faithfull Lordes, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſts, and that we are the Lords,
and that hee taketh a care of vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From
thence alſo thoſe godlie auncient men
chiefly learned the ſame thing, becauſe
they felt God preſent with them in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deede in whatſoever perrilles. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, <hi>David</hi> is to be nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred,
who as he was laid open to many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
ſo he felt exceeding many delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces,
&amp; he perſwaded himſelf, that god
had a ſpeciall care of him, &amp; in the ſelfe
ſame place, in which hee ſaide that the
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:10992:261"/>
death intended againſt the godly, was
Precious in the eies of Iehova, he with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
all doubt, meaneth that this was
a document of the favour &amp; care of God
toward vs, in reſpect that our death is
precious in his ſight. Laſt marke: At
what time doth <hi>David</hi> finally glory in
that, that he is the ſonne of the hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
of GOD; that is, borne of that
mother, which was in the covenante
with GOD, ſurely even then, when
therewith, he acknowledgeth that hee
is the ſervant of God. It is profitable in
deede to be borne of the Saints, and of
thoſe Parents who are in Gods cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
ſo long as thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueſt in that
covenant with God, and art Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
for ſo that promiſe of GOD, of
long &amp; durable mercy, which is made
in the ſeconde command, belongeth
vnto thee; <hi>I will haue mercy</hi> (ſayeth hee)
<hi>vpon the thouſand generation of thoſe that
loue me, and keepe my commandements.</hi>
But if thou make thy ſelfe vnworthie,
both of thy parents, &amp; likewiſe of that
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:10992:261"/>
covenant of God, that ſhall nothing
profite thee, that thou art borne of the
Saintes &amp; of parents, that are confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
with God. It profiteth thee nothing
that thou art able to ſet downe thy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree,
in a certaine continuall race, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, with whom
the firſt covenante of God was made.
<hi>I will ſacrifice to thee]</hi> He repeateth that
promiſe of thankſgiving, which was
ſet down before in the 13. verſe. Of the
which, becauſe we haue ſpoken ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ynough there, we ſhall be the
ſhorter; therefore in opening of the
ſame: Only we ſhall adde this much to
the things that wee haue ſpoken, that
fra once that ſtupiditie of our mind is
ſhaken off, and fra once we beginne to
prayſe God, and to giue him thankes,
we are ſo carryed away, by that Spirit
of GOD, that wee can ſcarce make an
end of the prayſing of God. We are in
deede, but very ſlowlie ſtirred vppe to
prayſe God; but being once ſtirred vp,
wee take ſuch delight in prayer for a
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:10992:262"/>
time, and through that joye, our heart
doth boyle, ſo that in a manner it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
powred out into the prayſes
of our God. Wherfore to the end that
we may praiſe God, this deadly ſopour
of our mind is perpetually to be ſhake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
off, and wee muſt endeavour that at no
time, ſo far as it is poſſible, this our hart
be altogether voyde of feeling, either
of our miſery, or of the mercy of God
in Ieſus Chriſt: for of this two-folde
feeling, there aryſeth a two-fold affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and of joye: From ſorrow ſpeciallie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe

or borrowed ſpeech, is taken
from waters, in which men are almoſt
drowned. Looke the Pſal. 69. 2. 3. &amp;c.
This is out of all doubt, that while any
man ſticketh in moſt deepe perrilles,
then hee powreth out from a moſte
hollowe and deepe hearte, fervente
prayers, yea, hee cryeth vppon the
Lorde mightelie: For ſo the Prophet
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:10992:263"/>
ſpeaketh of himſelfe here: <hi>Out of the
deapthes, I cryed vnto thee, ô Iehova.</hi> Thou

exceeding grievouſlie afflicted, &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with the hande of God, at that
ſame time, they vſe earneſtly to deale
with their God, and to haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
chiefely vnto him, with prayers
and ſupplications. For (that the trueth
of this propoſition may be manifeſte)
afflictiones worke in our hearts, firſte
ſome feeling of our ſinne and miſery.
For vnleſſe God exerciſed his owne,
after ſuch waies as he knoweth moſte
meete, ſurely they would never come
to a ſenſe of this common miſerie of
their nature: then next, when once the
heart is prepared with ſome feeling of
the owne miſery; Then the ſpirite of
God, which they call the Spirite of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
toucheth the ſame, with ſome
ſenſe of the mercy of God: And to
ſpeake with the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5,</note>

the mercy of God in Chriſt Ieſus, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
firſt they be prepared with ſome
feeling of miſery. And then, after that
the holy Spirite hath powred out that
loue of God into our hearts, then wee
conceiue in our minds that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence,
whereby wee draw neere and incalles
vpon him: For this is the Spirit which
the Apoſtle calleth, <hi>The Spirite of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by whom, we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> We
crye, ſayeth hee, becauſe the Spirite of
adoption, through the feeling of the
loue, worketh that confidence in the
heart, that the heart being firſt enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
then nexte the mouth, wee may
call God Father, with a free and ſhrill
voyce. Therefore, fra once the Spirite
hath indewed our ſoules with a feiling
of the loue of God, we goe freely vnto
God, and praye vnto him; For except
there bee firſt ſome feeling of the loue
of God, certainely there can be no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

vppon his name. Then thou ſeeſt
that that is true, which we ſpake at the

the more fervent are their prayers. We
becaus we ar not drowned yet in thoſe

now hee ſetteth downe that forme of
prayer, which hee then vſed in calling
vpon God. <hi>Heare</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>O Lorde

of the ſame petition, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

and grace of the holye Spirite: For

the affection bee inlarged, ſurely the

the Spirite by whome wee crye, as it
were, with a mouthe ſtretched out
wide. For howe oft wee double our
crye, ſo oft the feeling of the Spirite
is doubted in our hearte: The firſte
crye, proceedeth from the firſte fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

God, to this end, that he would len his

eare vnto his prayers? Thought the that
God was deafe? Theſe which are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with Gods hande, they thinke
that God is ſo eſtranged from them,
that he nether ſeeth, nor heareth them,
neither that hee remembreth them at
all. From whence ariſe thoſe ſo lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
voyces, <hi>Heare, ô Lord, See ô Lord,
Remember ô Lord,</hi> which occurre every
where in the Pſalmes: But are they
which call vpon God from their hart,
and earneſtly deſire his preſence; are
thoſe, I ſaye, in the meane time altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſtitute of the preſence of God?
Would they, I praye you, bee able to
ſeeke the preſence of God, vnles ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they had ſome preſence of GOD,
through his own holy Spirite. Are we
able without God, to thirſt after God.
What require we therefore, which we
now haue? For this cauſe we doe this,
that we may the more enjoy and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
God. For prayers bring that to
paſſe, that God draweth neere vnto vs,
and they are the increaſe of mercy &amp;
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:10992:265"/>
grace, for it is not poſſible, that thoſe
ſighes which are not ſo much oures, as
the holy Spirits in our heart, and the
cryes of that ſame Spirit in our mouth
can paſſe away in vaine. For GOD
knoweth what the meaning of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is, <hi>And bleſſed are thoſe that hunger
and thirſt for righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall
be ſatisfied.</hi> And we find that in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in our ſelues, that wee no ſooner
ſigh vnto GOD, but our ſoules are
watered over with a certaine vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
ioye: ſo that we truely feele that
thing, to wit, that the preſence of God,
through the Spirit of heavines and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vtterable
ſighes, cauſeth the preſence
of God through the Spirit of ioy and
vnſpeaktble gladnes. <hi>If thou ſhalt]</hi> The
preventing of an objection: For this
might haue bene objected either by
God, or by his own conſcience. Thou
art a ſinner, Then how ſhall I heare
thee? Why doe I not rather conſume
thee in my wrath? He anſwereth, firſt
by a conceſſion, If thou ſhalt ſtraightly
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:10992:266"/>
mark iniquities, O God, ſurely I grant
that no mortall man can ſtande in thy
ſight, but of neceſſitie, he muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
be thy wrath. Then next he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth
by an correction: <hi>But vvith
the is forgiueneſſe;]</hi> As if hee ſhould
ſaye; Thou markeſt not our iniquities
according to thy juſtice, but of thine
infinite mercy, thou forgaveſt them al,
in thy Son Ieſus chriſt. For the Fathers
indeede, and thoſe auncient Prophets,
felt not at any time, their ſinnes to bee
forgiven them, through the mercie of
GOD, but by that mercy in Chriſte,
who hath promiſed vnto them, whom
they ſawe as it were a farre off, and in
whome alone the wrath of God was
pacified, even ſince the beginning of
the world, to the ende, that ſome place
might be left for his mercy. For vnles,
firſt his juſtice be ſatisfied, ſurely there
is no place for the mercy of God. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
our eſtate, in that reſpect is the more
bleſſed, then that eſtate of the Fathers,
becaus that ſacrifice of Chriſt, is preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
&amp; before our eies, which they behold
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:10992:266"/>
a far off, &amp; in plain words may ſay, God
in chriſt is merciful, &amp; hath forgiven al
our ſins, which they no way ar able to
ſay. We learne alſo in this place this, by
the example of the Prophete, that the
conſcience of ſinne, which wee call
the trouble or evill of the conſcience,
is an impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that we pray not friely
vnto God: Yea, we finde alſo the ſame
in experience, that an evil conſcience,
vnles it be clenſed, vtterly ſtoppeth vp
to vs, al entry vnto God. For that is the
thing which the Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>Let vs
draw neere with our harts, purged from an
evill conſcience.</hi> Wherefore no entrie
is patent vnto God, except the heartes
bee firſt purged, from an evill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Alſo, that thing which we ſpake
concerning the conſcience of ſinne,
we affirme the ſame of ſinne the ſelfe,
which if it be not altogether remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of the ſight of GOD; ſurelie
God ſhal not ſo much indeed, as count
vs worthie of his ſight: And this is
that which is ſpoken in this place,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:10992:267"/>
                        <hi>If thou ſhalt ſtraightly marke iniquities, ô
Iah, Lord, who can be able to ſtand]</hi> Then,
to comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in one word the things
we haue ſpoken. The conſcience of
ſinne, which forbiddeth vs to look vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our God: And that is ſinne, which
hindreth God to looke and behold vs
that are miſerable. And we learne the
remedie of this evill, out of the ſecond
part of the aunſwere: <hi>But with thee is
forgiueneſſe]</hi> Wherefore this is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remedie, that wee haue our refuge
vnto the mercy of God, yea, and that
by a ſimple and cleare confeſſion of
our ſinne. For no man ever yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
before God, but as a certaine
guiltie perſon, craving the mercie of
God earneſtly, with a confeſſion of his
ſinnes: But in this the whole difficultie
conſiſteth, how we may come to that
throne of grace. For ſeeing we cannot
pearſe, but as it were, through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of juſtice, as it were, through a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
fire, and ſlamming wall vnto the
mercy of God, and to that throne of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:10992:267"/>
grace, ſurely it is requiſite, that he that
would draw neere to that throne of
grace, bee enarmed and prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that wrath and righteouſneſſe
of GOD, which ſuffereth nothing,
which hath, yea, and it were never ſo
little vncleanneſſe in it, to approche
neere to that inviolable majeſtie. Now
we cannot be armed againſt the heate
of that fire, with any other thing, then
with the alone righteouſneſſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of Ieſus Chriſt. Wherefore,
whoſoever would draw neere to the
throne of grace, and breake through
the middeſt of that juſtice and wrath
of God, of neceſſitie that man muſt be
found to be in Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>and that he
be purged by that bloud offered by his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
ſpirit, from his dead workes. Heb. 9.</hi>
Then, after he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med to the throne
of grace, by the faith of Chriſt, then is
that paſſing ſweete voice of forgivenes
and iuſtification heard. <hi>That thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt]</hi>
This is the ende of the mercy and
forgiueneſſe of GOD, his worſhip
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:10992:268"/>
and reverence. For no man ever at any
time reverently worſhipped God; but
he, to whom his ſinnes were forgiven
through the mercy of God, that is, but
to him who felt that benefite of the
forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes. For no man
gloryfieth God, vnleſſe hee himſelfe
firſt be glorified of God; alſo, no man
is glorified, but hee who is already ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.
Wherefore the firſt effecte of
forgiueneſſe, or pardoning of ſinnes,
is ſanctification, or our glorifying. And
we, when we are already glorified, we
glorifie our GOD, not that hee hath
neede of any of our glorifying, which
commeth from vs, ſeeing his glory is
perfite in the ſelfe: But becauſe our
duty requireth the ſame, yea, and that
for our owne weill. For in this our
happineſſe conſiſteth, not that wee
our ſelues ſhould be gloryfied, but
that we ſhould rather glorifie for euer
our God. For to this end, as we are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and redeemed.</p>

and that indeed are occupied in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall

coms in their roome, but they muſte
watch the whole night long. Learne

to Iſrael, that is, to the whole Church,
that ſelfe ſame awaiting that hee hath.
For hee, who by awayting, hath once
felt in experience that mercy of God,
not onely he himſelf waiteth for God
in time to come; but he will haue all
men together with him, to waite for
Iehova, that all together may feele in

he willeth that all men, if it be poſſible
to be done, feele that loving kindneſſe
of the Lord which he hath felt. Alſo,
this chiefely is meete for Iſraell to bee
done, that is, for the Church of God.
But that, which the Prophet reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
as the laſt end, is the glory of God
himſelf. For every faithful man willeth
that many obteine mercy, to this end,
that many may glorifie GOD, and is

Hee demonſtrateth not to Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
a God, either mightie, righteous,

GOD. VVherefore doth hee ſo?
doe not the remanent properties in
GOD, as almightineſſe, righteouſnes,
wiſedome, trueth, &amp;c. Doe not theſe,
I ſaye, purchaſe vnto him the mindes
and faith of men? I graunt all theſe
thinges, that in their owne place in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deede,
they purchaſe the faith of men;
but ſeeing miſerable men and ſinners,
haue chiefelie neede of the mercie:
Surely it is the mercie of God, which
men chiefely require, and it is the firſt
object of faith. Alſo, when once faith
hes apprehended the mercy of God in
Chriſt: then the other things which ar
in God, allure the ſame faith to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
But without the feeling of the

Firſt therefore, and properly,

the more wee ſeeke out in GOD that
his infinite mercie, ſo much the more,
doe we beleeue him, For what other
thing, I praye you, is the growth of
faith, but an increaſe of the knowledge
of the mercy of God: wherefore to the

For there is ever ſomething reſting

yea, and it were no more but that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

thought, the words were greater then

the matters themſelves, which thing,
whoſoever think, ſurely they appeare
to me indeed, never to haue compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in their minde, the mercy of
God in Chriſt. <hi>And he himſelfe]</hi> This
is the other argument, whereby, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
aſſuredly, redemption to the
Church, from her ſinnes; he applyeth
that loving kindneſſe of God, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde
redemption, which hee hath
publiſhed, more neere vnto them. For
it is not ſufficient ynough for faith,
that any man in generall ſhall preach &amp;
recommend onely the mercy of God,
vnles it promiſe, that is apply aſſuredly
the ſame to miſerable men: for the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſes
are ſo many applyings, of the
mercy of God. And from thence it
proceedeth, that the Scriptures are ful
of promiſes, without the which, that
full perſwaſion of faith, &amp; ſpiritual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
cannot be. For this generall
doctrine, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the mercy of God,
doth this to vs, that not ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
we in effect beleeue, as that our
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:10992:275"/>
heartes, may be prepared vnto faith.
This is to be obſerved, that he ſaith, <hi>that
God wil redeeme Iſrael,</hi> not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outward troubles whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver;
but from al her ſins. For the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church, is not ſene in that,
that ſhe is delivered from the troubles
of this world, as in that, that ſhe ſhal be
delivered from her ſins. For ſin is the
moſt deadly enemy of al, &amp; is the cauſe
of all the reſte of the enemies of the
church: becauſe, al afflictions, are both
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin, &amp; likewiſe tende to the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of ſin. For it is certaine, if there
were not any ſin in the Church, there
ſhuld be no perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church:
and every one of the godly, ſighs more
vnder the burthen of ſin, then vnder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other weight of afflictions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Chriſt himſelfe alſo dyed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
vs, not ſo much from al afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as from ſinne and that everlaſting
death. Finally, when at that daye, wee
ſhall be ſet free, into the liberty of the

<pb n="488" facs="tcp:10992:276"/>
we ſhall glory, not ſo much, that we ar

then that wee are fully delivered from

Pſalme; The complainte, in which
there is firſt, the propoſition of the
complaint, when he ſayeth, <hi>wee weept
very much]</hi> That is, we were extreame
ſorrowfull: <hi>For the Spirit maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion
for the church, with ſighes that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:10992:277"/>
be expreſſed</hi> Ro. 8. ſo to ſpeak with the
Apoſtle: And it cannot be ſufficientlie
ſpoken, with how great heavineſſe, the
Church is accuſtomed to be moved,
when ſhe is humbled vnder the hande
of God. This murning and ſorrow of
the Church, is circumſcrived by the
own ſubject, when he ſayeth, <hi>By the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Babylonia]</hi> That is, of the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonical
monarchie: For the Iewes wer
not only caryed away into Babylonia,
ſo properly called, but they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
throughout the Babylonicall
juriſdictions; as it may be moſt clearly
gathered out of <hi>Ezekiel, Daniell,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi>
Then the place is the Babylonicall
monarchie in general, but in particular
the brinkes of the rivers: For he ſayth,
<hi>By the rivers of Babylonia: Wee ſitting
there,</hi> that is, ſitting vpon the brinks of
the rivers, vnto ſuch time, as all were
ferried over. This place of the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonical
monarchie, conteineth in the
ſelfe, a certaine cauſe of this weeping,
which hee ſetteth downe. For the
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:10992:277"/>
place manifeſtlie ſheweth, the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and carrying away into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
from their natiue ſoile to an ſtrange
lande. Then the people being in their
journey, farre from home, and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
bewayleth their ſinnes, which
ought to haue bin bewayled at home.
Not-with-ſtanding, thoſe who will
not murne at home, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to murne far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their home.
For ſinnes of neceſſitie, are once to
be bewayled, and wee muſt bee ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull,
either ſooner or later, becauſe
we haue offended GOD. And if wee
be not ſorrowfull at home, ſurely wee
ſhall murne far from home. And if we
murne not in this life, ſurely wee ſhall
be ſorrowfull in that other life, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
death, where there ſhall nothing
be heard, <hi>but wayling and gnaſhing of
teeth.</hi> Bleſſed are they alſo who later,
yea, and that in exile, yea, at any time
whatſoever ar earneſtly ſorrowful for
their ſinnes, if ſo be, they deferre not
their mourning to an other Worlde,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:10992:278"/>
bleſſed are they. For even thoſe, who
do later, yea, or at whatſoever time,
murne and repent in this life; in that
other life, <hi>all teares ſhall bee wiped awaye
from their eies:</hi> But thoſe who laugh in
this life, and refuſe to murne in that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life, there ſhall be none ende or
meaſure of their ſorrow. <hi>When wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred]</hi>
This is the other cauſe of
the mourning, but ſome-what more
cleare, to witte, the remembrance of
<hi>Tzijon,</hi> that is, of Ieruſalem, where the
viſible and outwarde preſence of God
to be looked vpon was. For theſe who
are baniſhed from God, they do ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feele, what great profite, yea, and it
were no more but this which is in the
preſence of GOD, and which is in this
his viſible miniſtery, &amp; what great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie
is in that his abſence: we
while we haue God preſent in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
and beholde him after ſome
ſort in that mirrour of his Goſpell, we
acknowledge not how happie we bee,
and it were no more, but for that ſelfe
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:10992:278"/>
ſame cauſe. But if it ſhall come to paſſe
at any time, through the righteous
judgment of GOD, that this mirrour
of the Goſpell, and this outwarde mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie
be taken away from our eies,
then indeed wee ſhall feele in effecte,
what great miſery it is to bee deſtitute
thereof. I ſpeake ſpecially concerning
thoſe, who are accuſtomed at any time
to feele ſome pleaſure, of this ſincere
preaching of the worde, &amp; adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sacraments. <hi>David</hi> being
in exile, <hi>Remembring thoſe things</hi> (ſayth
he) <hi>I poure out my ſoule vpon my ſelf, when
I remember that I was woont to paſſe by in
the congregation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to walke with them vnto
the houſe of God, &amp;c.</hi> Behold <hi>David,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
baniſhed from the viſible Church
of God, he was exceeding greatly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull:
But what is the cauſe? <hi>Even,
becauſe hee vvas woont to vvalke together
vvith the Church vnto the houſe of GOD,
vvith the voyce of ſinging and prayſe:</hi>
That is, becauſe he was to feele no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pleaſure of that external and viſible
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:10992:279"/>
miniſterie. And therefore being nowe
a baniſhed man, the remembrance of
that Spiritual pleaſure &amp; joy, mooved
him to no ſmal diſpleaſure. Here we ar
to be admoniſhed, that this dolor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the remembrance of that
heavenly ioy, is not the ſorrow of this
worlde; But it is, that dolour, which is
called the godly ſorrow, which ſurely,
hath greater ioy mixed therwith, then
is the whole joy of this worlde, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it be voyde of all ſenſe of ſorrow.
For every one of the godly, while they
mourne, they feele in the meane time,
ane <hi>vnſpeakable ioy, conioyned with ſighes
that cannot bee expreſſed. In it we han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

are ſorrowfull earneſtly, &amp; from their
hearte, they thinke that all ioye, and
matter of ioye, is a diſpleaſure vnto
them, and contrariwiſe, they thinke
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:10992:279"/>
all heauineſſe to bee vnto them as a

required of them, thus carried awaie,

Joyfull ſongs; but the Church indeede
was not mooved and brought on to
ſing, for all their authority and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
For the ſoule that is humbled
by Gods hand, cannot be lifted vp by
any authority of men, neither can bee

Alſo, the firſt reaſon is taken, from the
prophaning of the holy ſongs, which
is to bee vnderſtoode in theſe wordes:
<hi>The ſongs of Iehova:</hi> Then, <hi>in the Lande
of ſtrangers:</hi> That is, in a prophane land,
among prophane men. For to ſing the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:10992:281"/>
ſongs of Iehova, that is, the ſongs that
are holy vnto God, at the pleaſure of
prophane men; what other thing is it,
then to prophane the holy things of
God? for to lay out whatſoever holy
things, either the word of God, or the
Sacraments, or any other thing of that
ſort, vnto the pleaſure of men, that are
defiled and vncleane, which doe not
ſeeke ſo much as their owne edifying
in them, or the glory of God, but their
owne vncleane delight, what other
thing is it, I praye you, then to caſte
pearles before ſwine? <hi>If I forget]</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon, from the forgetting of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſchalaim,
&amp; of the church of God: it
is made after this maner: If I ſhal now
ſing (ſayeth the holy congregation)
this were to forget Ieruſalem and the
Church of God: But I will not forget
Ieruſalem: Therfore I will not ſing:
Marke then, what it is to ſing or rejoice
in the meane time, that the Church of
God is any way afflicted. Surely, it is no
other thing, then to forget the church:
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:10992:281"/>
But contrariwiſe, to murne with the
murning Church, what other thing is
it then to remember the Church? For
we teſtifie, that we haue a regard of the
Church of God, and that we take care
thereof, from this common affection,
and this mutual compaſſion; whereby
it commeth to paſſe, that wee rejoyce
with the rejoycing Church, &amp; murne
with her, when ſhe mourneth. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of this reaſon, is not ſet down
nakedly, but with an execration, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he wiſheth a vengeance to fal vpon
him ſelf; that is, the impotencie of his
own right hand, if he ſhal ſtrik the harp
therwith, &amp; the vnmoveablenes of his

Pſalme, or an imprecation againſt
the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and a prophetical denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation

then after that the Church hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed
her captiuitie, in the middes
of the ſorrow ſhe turneth her ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and ſhee prayeth for an vtter

the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and ſhe denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
aſſuredly the judgement of God
to come vpon them. We learne by the
example of this Church, from what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
any imprecations and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
whatſoever, ſhould proceede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Gods enemies; That is, from an
heavines and ſorrow of the heart, and
not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any light motion of the mind.
For when they come from ſorrow &amp;
heavines, then indeed they are heavie,
and in their owne time, they bring on
a ſure judgement; otherwiſe, they are
but light, and they provoke God more
to wrath againſt our ſelues, then againſt

our enemies. Marke, as concerning the
Edomites; we read not that they, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the cittie of God, only they did ſhow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they were involved in the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Then, as concerning the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
not only they denunce the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
