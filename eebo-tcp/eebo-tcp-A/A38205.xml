            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat the said <hi>Matthew Wren,</hi> being Popishly and
superstitiously affected, did at his first coming
to be Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> which was in the yeer
1635. endeavour by sundry wayes, and means, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the powerfull and painfull Preaching of the
Word of God; did introduce divers orders, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,
tending to superstition and Idolatry; did
disturb, and disquiet the orderly, and settled estate of the
Ministers, and people, and Churches of that Diocesse,
to the great prejudice of His Majesty, the great grief
and disquiet, and hazard of the estates, consciences,
and lives of many of His Majesties Loyall Subjects
there, to the manifest bringing in, and increasing of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse,
ignorance, and disobedience in the Common

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94024:3"/>
even, and flat, without any steps ascending cowards
the East-end of the same, and are by the Rubrick in
the Book of Common-prayer, ordered to continue as
they were, and so ought to have continued. He of his
own minde and will, without any lawfull warrant or
authority, in the yeer 1636. being then Bishop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
ordered and enjoyned, that the same should be
raised towards the East-end, some two, some three, some
foure steps, that so the Communion Table there placed

Table which is appointed by the said Rubrick,
at the time of the celebration of the holy Communion,
to be placed in the Body of the Church or Chancell,
where Divine Prayers are usually read, and where the
people might best hear, should be set up close under
the Wall at the East-end of the Chancell Altarwise, and
not to be removed from thence; whereby the Minister,
who is by the Law to officlate at the Northside of the
Table, must either stand and officiate at the North-end
of the Table so standing Altarwise, or else after the
Popish and Idolatrous manner, stand and officiate at
the Westside of the Table with his back towards the
people.</p>

the Communion Table so set Altarwise as aforesaid,
which Rayl should reach from the Southside of the
Chancell to the North within, which the Minister onely
should enter, as a place too holy for the people; and

after he had finished the reading of some part of
the Morning-Prayer, at the Desk, should go out from
the same to the holy Table set Altarwise, as to a more
holy place and there, when no Communion was to be
administred, read at the said Table a part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Service, now commonly called the second Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
whereby the consciences both of the Minister, and
people, have been not onely very much offended, and
grieved, but also the Service it self was made very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to the people, who could not hear what was
said, or prayed in that place.</p>

Master <hi>William Guest,</hi> Master <hi>John Dunckon,</hi> and others
following his example, did ever after the Table was so
set Altarwise, use and perform such, so many, and so
frequent bowing, and adorations before, and towards

others to the like superstitious gestures, and have given
great scandall, and offence to the sound, sincere, and
well affected Christians.</p>

come up to the Rayl to receive the holy Communion,

And that the Minister should within the Rayl de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Bread to such people onely as should so come
up and kneel before the said Table as aforesaid. This
was to the offence of the consciences of many good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who for fear of Idolatry and superstition, durst not
come to kneel at the said Rayl before the Table so pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Altarwise; and many people not coming up thither,
though presenting themselves upon their knees in the
Chancell, have not had the Communion delivered unto
them, and afterward for not receiving have been excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,

               <p>He did in the said yeer 1636. enjoyn and command
that there should be no Sermons on the Lords dayes in
the afternoon, or on the week dayes at all, without his
Licence. And also enjoyned that there should be no
Catechising, but onely such questions, and answers, as
are contained in the Book of the Common prayer. Not
allowing the Ministers to expound or open the points
of the same to the people. He and his under officers
affirming in publike places, that such an exposition
might be as ill as a Sermon. And the more to hearten,

He enjoyned the Ministers to read publikely in their
Churches, a Book published touching sports on the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94024:4"/>

did apply themselves to the Service of God in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where both Prayers, and Preaching was to be; He
to hinder the people in their good desires of serving of

two or three dayes before every Communion, a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
Sermon to prepare, and instruct the people in the
right and worthy receiving of the Communion, He the

He endeavouring to suppresse the power, and benefit of
Prayer in the yeer 1636, enjoyned that no Minister
should use any prayer before his Sermon, but move the
people to pray onely in the words of the fifty fifth Canon
made <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1603. which Canon was not warranted
by the Law. And that no prayer should be used before
or after the Sermon. And he in his own person having
been at the Sermon in the Town of <hi>Ipswich</hi> when the
Preacher did use or make any other prayer, did sit upon
his seat withont using, or giving any reverence of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or otherwise, thereby to discountenance such
prayer. And he in the said yeer 1636. enjoyned that no
prayer should be made in the Pulpit for the sick, and
that such as were prayed for in the reading Desk, should
be prayed for onely in the two Collects prescribed for
the visitation of the sick in private houses.</p>

conforme to his directions <hi>editis &amp; edendis,</hi> by meanes
whereof some ministers were enforced to depart this
Realme into Holland, and other parts beyond Sea, viz.
the said Mr. <hi>William Bridge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ieremy Borrowes,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Ward,</hi> and others of Norwich,
to remove into other more peaceable diocesses, as namely
Mr. <hi>Edmund Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Broome,</hi> Mr. <hi>Beard</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and some of them so prosecuted, as hath beene su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
to bee the Cause of their deathes, as namely Mr.
<hi>Thomas Scot</hi> and others; the terror of which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
hath caused other ministers to leave their Cures,
and goe away, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>William Kirington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas
Warren,</hi> Master <hi>Iohn Allen</hi> and others; and if a stranger
preached at the Cure of such person suspended, the
Church-wardens permitting such person so to preach,
were enjoyned pennance, and otherwise troubled, as
namely the Church-wardens of Snailwell, and the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for preaching, was also therefore molested, <hi>viz,</hi> Mr.
<pb facs="tcp:94024:6"/>
                  <hi>Ash,</hi> Mr. <hi>Eades,</hi> Master <hi>Manning,</hi> and other Ministers.</p>
               <p>14. That during the time he was Bishop of the said
See of Norwich, hee did unlawfully compell the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the severall parishes, within that Dioces, to raise
the flowers of the Chancells, of their respective Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
to raile in their Communion Tables, to remove the
Pewes and Seats, and to make other alterations in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Churches; in the doing whereof the said inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
were put to great excessive, and unnecessary
charges and expences, amounting in the whole, to the
summe of five thousand pounds, and upwards, which
said charges and expences, he did by unlawfull meanes
and courses, enforce the said inhabitants to undergoe;
And such of the said inhabitants, as did not obey the
same, hee did vex, trouble and molest by presentments,
Citation, excommunications, tedious, and frequent Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes,
and by attendances at the Courts of his Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
and other his officialls, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church-wardens of
Lin, Ipswich, S. <hi>Edmunds Bury,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>15. That for not comming up to the raile, to receive
the holy communion, kneeling there before the table
Altarwise, for not standing up at the Gospell, and for
not observing and performing of his unlawfull innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Injunctions, many other of his Majesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<hi>viz. Peter Fisher, Samuel Duncon, Iames Percivall,
Iohn Armiger, Thomas King</hi> and others, have beene by
him, his Chancellors, Visitors, Commissaryes, and Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
by his command and injunctions, much molested, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted,
and vexed in their estates and consciences by
Citations to the Courts, long attendance there, dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Fees, Excommunications, Penancies, and other
Censures.</p>
               <p>16. That by reason of the rigorous prosecutions, and
<pb facs="tcp:94024:6"/>
dealings in the last precedent Articles mentioned, and
by reason of the continuall superstitious bowing to,
and afore the table set Altarwise, the suspending, silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
driving away of the painfull preaching Ministers,
the suppressing, and forbidding of Sermons, and prayer;
the putting downe of Lectures, the suppressing meanes of
knowledg, and salvation, and introducing ignorance,
superstition, &amp; prophanenesse, many of his Majesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to the number of three thousand, many of which
used trades of spinning, weaving, knitting, and making of
Cloth, and Stuffe, Stockings, and other manufactures
of Woolls, that is to say, <hi>Daniell Sunning, Michaell Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calfe,
Iohn Berant, Nicholas Metcalfe, Iohn Derant, Busby</hi>
widdow <hi>Mapes, Richard Cock, Iohn Dicks, Francis
Lawes, Iohn Senty</hi> and many others, some of them setting
an hundred poore people on worke, have removed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
their families, and estates into Holland, and other
parts beyond the Seas, and there set up and taught the
Natives there, the said manufactures, to the great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of trade in this kingdome, and to the impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
and bringing to extreame want, very many who
were by those parties formerly set on worke, to the great
prejudice of his Majestie and his people.</p>
               <p>17. That hee the said Bishop, finding the people to
distaste his innovations hath often in publike, and private
speeches declared in the said yeare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1636. That what
hee did in the same, was by his Majesties command,
whereby he contrary to the duty of his place, which he
held under his Majestie, being Deane of his Majesties
Royall Chappell, and contrary to the duty of a good
and loyall subject, endeavoured to free himselfe of blame,
and to raise an ill opinion of his Royall Majestie, in the
hearts of his loving subjects.</p>
               <p>18. That he the said <hi>Matthew Wren,</hi> being Bishop
<pb facs="tcp:94024:7"/>
of Norwich in the said yeare, 1636. in the Tower Church
in Ipswich, and other places, did in his owne person use
superstitious and idolatrous actions, and gestures, in the
administration of the Lords supper, consecrating the
bread, and wine, standing at the West side of the Table
with his face to the East, and his back towards the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
elevating the Bread, and Wine, so high as to bee seene
over his shoulders bowing low, either to or before
them, when he after the elevation, and consecration, had
set them downe on the Table.</p>
               <p>19. That he the more to manifest his Popish affection
in the said yeare 1636, caused a Crucifix, that is to say,
the figure of Christ upon the Crosse to be engraven upon
his Episcopall Seale besides the Armes of the See.</p>
               <p>20. That he hath chosen &amp; imployed such men to be
his Commissioners, Rurall Deanes, and to be his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Chaplaines, whom he knew to be, and stand affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to his innovated courses, and to popish superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to be erroneous, and unsound in judgement
and practise, as namely M. <hi>Iohn Nouel,</hi> M. <hi>Edmond Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletoft,</hi>
M. <hi>Iohn Dunkin,</hi> M. <hi>Bouck,</hi> M. <hi>Dun,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>21. That he hath very much oppressed divers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
of Churches by admitting without any colour of
title his owne Chaplaines and others whom he affected
into Livings, which became void within his Dioces, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
enforcing the true and right Patrons to long and
chargeable suits to evict such Incumbents, and to recover
their own right, some of which he did against his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
word given to the said Patrons or their friends in <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo
Sacerdotis</hi> not to do the same. This he did in the case
of one M. <hi>Rivet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>22. That he and others in the yeare 1635, sould, or
<pb facs="tcp:94024:7"/>
granted away the profits of his Primary Visitation for
five hundred pounds over and above the charges of the
Visitation, and for the better benefit of the Farmer, set
forth a book in the yeare 1636 intituled Articles to be
inquired of within the dioces of Norwich, in the first
Visitation of <hi>Matthew</hi> Lord Bishop of Norwich, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of 139 Articles, and wherein are contained the
number of eight hundred ninety seven questions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to all which, the Churchwardens were inforced to
present upon paine of perjury. And some Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
that is to say, <hi>Robert Langley, Charles Newton,
Richard Hart, William Bull,</hi> and <hi>Zephany Ford,</hi> and
others not making presentments accordingly, were ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
molested, and troubled, and injoyned pennance;
notwithstanding many of the said Articles were ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and impossible.</p>
               <p>23. That the Churchwardens, and other men sworne
at the Visitation, were inforced to have their present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
written by Clarks specially appointed by such as
bought the said Visitation, to whom they paid excessive
summes of money for the same, some two and twenty
shillings, as namely, <hi>Richard Hurrell, Iohn Punchard,</hi> and
others, some more, some lesse, for writing one present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the grievous oppression of his Majesties poore
subjects in that dioces.</p>
               <p>24. Whereas by the Lawes of this Realme no tythes
ought to be paid out of the rents of houses, nor is there
any custome or usage in the City of Norwich for such
payment, yet the said Bishop indeavoured to draw the
Citizens, and other inhabitants within the said City against
their wils and consents to pay two shillings in the
pound in liew of the tithes of houses within the severall
Parishes of the said City, unto the Ministers there, of the
said respective parishes. And the better to effect this his
<pb facs="tcp:94024:8"/>
unjust resolution, he did by false and undue suggestion
in the fourteenth yeere of his Majesties reigne that now
is, procure his Majestie to declare under his Highnesse
great Seale of England his royall pleasure, That if any
person, within the said City shall refuse to pay accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the said rate of two shillings the pound unto the
Minister of any Parish within the said City, That the
same be-heard in the Court of Chancery, or in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory
of the Bishop of Norwich. And that in such case
no prohibition against the said Bishop of Norwich, their
Chancellors, or Commissaries in the said Courts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory
be granted. And if any such writ be at any time
obtained, the Judges so granting the same, upon sight of
his Highnesse said Order shall forthwith grant a consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to the Minister desiring the same with his reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
costs and charges for the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which said order
and decree under the great Seale of England tended to
the violation of the oathes of the Judges, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised,
contrived, and made by the said Bishop. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by his evill counsels and false surmises he did
obtaine his Majesties royall consent thereunto &amp; by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the order aforesaid, and other the doings of the
said Bishop, the Citizens and inhabitans of Norwich
aforesaid, <hi>viz. Iohn Collar, Iudith Perkeford,</hi> and others,
have beene inforced to pay the said to shillings in the
pound in liew of tythes, or else by suits and other undue
meanes beene much molested, and put to great charges
and expences, contrary to the law, and justice.</p>
               <p>25. That he assumed to himselfe an arbitrary power
to compell the respective parishioners in the said dioces
to pay great and excessive wages to parish Clarks, <hi>viz.</hi>
the parishioners of Yarmouth, Congham, Tostock, and
others, commanding his officers, that if any parishioner
did resuse to pay such wages, they should certifie him
their names, and he would set them into the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb facs="tcp:94024:8"/>
Court for example of the rest. And that one or
two out of Ipswich might be taken for that purpose.</p>
               <p>And the said Commons by protestation saving to
themselves the liberties of exhibiting at any time hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any other accusation or impeachment against the
said <hi>Matthew Wren</hi> late Bishop of Norwich, and now
Bishop of Ely, and also of replying to the answer that he
the said <hi>Matthew Wren</hi> shall make unto the said Articles,
or any of them, or of offering proofe of the premisses or
any other impeachments or accusations that shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
by them as the case shal (according to the course
of Parliaments) require, do pray that he the said <hi>Matth.
Wren</hi> may be called to answer the said severall crimes,
and misdemeanours, and receive such condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as the same shall deserve, and that such further
proceedings may be upon every of them had, and used
against him, as is agreeable to law and justice.</p>
